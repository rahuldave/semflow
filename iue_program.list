AAEJL|A Test of Convective Model Atmospheres|John B.|Lester|Toronto-Erndl|We have recently completed a study of the changes in the structure of stellar atmospheres which result from the alteration of the mixing-length theory of convection. One of the things we found was that the spectral region 1500-200OX is a window to the conditions in the convection zone for those stars hot enough to have some flux in this band but cool enough to also have convection just below the photosphere. We also found that the metallicity of the atmosphere has an important effect on both the strength of the convection and the emergent flux in the 1500-2000 A region. To test these computational results we are requesting IUE observing time to measure the energy distributions in the 1500-2000 A region for a selected group of stars exhibiting both metal enhancements and metal deficiencies. These, together with the energy distributions for stars of normal composition which have already been measured by the IUE staff, will enable us to test our results and to gain a better understanding of convection.|Y
AANAD|Periodic Variability in the Hybrid Supergiant: Alpha Aquarii|Andrea K.|Dupree|Harvard CFA - SAO|Our recent discovery of a 75 day variability in the relative flux of chromospheric Ca II IT and K transitions from the hybrid supergiant Alpha Aquarii (HD 209750, G2 Ib) suggests that pulsation may be important in structuring the atmosphere and driving the substantial mass loss from the star. Variations observed in line profiles and fluxes of Ca II K (3933), Mg H ( 2795 and 2902), and He I (10830) support this conjecture. We propose to monitor Alpha Aquarii with ME (simultaneous with ground-based spectroscopic measures), once every 7 days covering the 77 day interval commensurate with the observed period of stellar Ca II variability. These observations will permit us to firmly identify the source of the variability, to study the structure and response of the atmosphere to a pulsation, and to search for spectroscopic signatures of mass outflow. The allotment of one half shift per observation should allow acquisition of spectra from a nearby secondary target, another hybrid star: Beta Aquarii.|Y
AAPAD|Supersonic Chromospheric Winds|Andrea K.|Dupree|Harvard CFA - SAO|We have discovered supersonic wind velocities in the chromosphere of the variable hybrid supergiant star: Alpha Aquarii (HD 209750; G2Ib). These mass motions in excess of the photospheric escape velocity are evident in the profile of the He I 10830A line, and confirmed by our model calculations. Such supersonic motion of a wind profoundly impacts the velocity profile and energy requirements of stellar winds and subsequent mass loss. We have proposed HST spectroscopic observations of Alpha Aqr in order to obtain line profiles and velocity shifts of transition region lines to identify the emitting region, to define the wind acceleration profile, and to settle long-standing controversies about the wind temperature. We are requesting 1 IUE shift 2 to measure the Mg II line profiles and fluxes and obtain transition region fluxes contemporaneously with HST in order to build a model of the atmosphere. We will not accept IUE time if our HST program is not scheduled.|Y

ABJTS|Short Term Variability of HD 163296|Theodore|Simon|NASA/GSFC|A time series of high resolution spectra obtained with ground-based telescopes and with IUE of the Herbig Ae star AB Aur revealed periodic variations at the base of the wind (in the Ca II K line), farther out in the chromosphere (in C IV 1549 A), and in the postchromosphere part of the wind (in Mg II 2800A). This discovery provided the first direct evidence of a non-axisymmetric wind in an A type pre-main sequence object. We proposed a solarwind type of model for AB Aur, in which alternating fast and slow speed streams originate from different regions of activity on the stellar surface. The streams rotate with the star at different periods at the base of the wind (32 hour period) and farther out (45 hour period), and as they cross the line of sight, they modulate the shapes of the optical and UV spectral lines.  Recently, we have discovered a second, and more spectacular, example of this phenomenon in the A0 Ve star HD 163296. In August 1986, we obtained parallel observations of Ca II K and with IUE that show the identical behavior as for AB Aur. However, the velocity amplitude in Mg II and the differential rotation between the Ca II and Mg II line forming regions of the envelope are much larger for 14D 163296 than for AB Aur. Since our time series of Mg II spectra covered only 1.5 rotation cycles, we are requesting additional time to observe HD 163296 over a longer time span. Our goal is to obtain a firmer estimate of the rotation period of the wind where the Mg II lines are formed and to establish the cycle-to-cycle and long term stability of the rotating stream pattern in the structure of the wind.|Y
ABKTS|Activity Cycle of Ab Aurigae|Theodore|Simon|Hawaii|High resolution spectra of the Ae stars AB Aur and HD 163296 have revealed periodic variations at the base of the wind (in the Ca II K line), farther out in the chromosphere (in C IV 1549 A), and in the post-chromosphere part of the wind (in Mg II 2800 A). These observations provide the first direct evidence of nonaxisymmetric winds in A-type pre-main sequence stars. We have proposed a solarwind type of model for these stars, in which alternating fast and slow speed streams originate from different regions of activity on the stellar surface. The streams rotate with the star at different periods at the base of the wind (32 hour period for AB Aur) and farther out (45 hour period), and as they cross the line of sight, they modulate the shapes of the optical and UV spectral lines. Our IUE observations of AB Aur suggest that the activity of this star may be evolving on time scales of several years. It is the aim of the research proposed here to observe these long-term changes in activity and to determine whether they are cyclic. The detection of a long-term activity cycle in AB Aur would provide a strong argument in favor of a magnetic origin of the activity. Because early-type stars are not expected to have a thick convection zone in which a dynamo mechanism like the Sun's would operate, the confirmation of an activity cycle in AB Aur would be very important to a general understanding of the origin of stellar magnetism and surface activity in a wide variety of stars.|Y

ABPGB|A Study of Radio Continuum Loop I Absorption near the 3C273 Sight Line|Geoffrey S.|Burks|Colorado - CASA|The spectrum of 3C273 shows strong Galactic C IV and Si IV absorption. 3C273 is also in the direction of the edge of continuum radio Loops I and IV. The equivalent widths are much greater than those in high latitude low halo sources. Two possible explanations for the increased equivalent widths are: 1. highly ionized gas in the upper halo, or 2. hot gas associated with the radio loop. The FOS spectra of 5 other QSO's were studied. The C IV and Si IV equivalent widths, and C IV/C IIand Si IV/ Si II ratios of 3C273 were noticeably higher than the values in the cases of the other QSO spectra. Thus, the 3C273 Galactic halo sight line is anomalous, and the high C IV and Si IV are most straight forwardly associated with the Radio (and soft X-ray) loop. This proposal seeks to confirm the Radio loop origin of the high ionization species by observing Galactic absorption in the spectra of rapidly rotating A stars in the direction of the radio/soft X-ray loop near the 3C273 sight line.|Y

From the lines that are found to present some idea of the gross temperature range can be assumed as well as gross abundances anomalies. From the equivalent width variations both of strength and phase an ---- of the type of density - temperature variation can be inferred. The continuum level and slope cange will tell what temperature range can be permitted.|Y
ACHEB|Age Dependence of the Boundary Line for Chromospheric Emission in the HR Diagram|Erika|Bohm-Vitense|Washington|We want to observe late A stars in the Hyades and Pleiades in order to see whether the boundary line for the onset of convection changes for younger stars. This is suggested by the changing appearance of the B-V gap for different clusters. The extrapolation of observed emission line fluxes for early F stars shows that the C IV and perhaps the C II lines are expected to be strong enough to be observable in spite of the increasing photospheric radiation if indeed the young late A stars have chromospheres and transition layers like the early F stars.|Y
ACHSA|The Population II A Type Star HD 109995. II|Saul J.|Adelman|The Citadel|We will derive in a thorough self-consistent analysis of the ultraviolet and optical data the photospheric elemental abundances of the Population II A type star HD 109995. IUE data will allow a more complete coverage of the periodic table than is possible with optical spectra alone. Comparison with the results of our previous studies of Population 1 B and A stars and with the predictions of astrophysical theories will yield information on the mixing of CNO processed material into the stellar envelope during red-giant stage evolution and on the nucleosynthetic evolution of heavier elements and enrichment of the interstellar medium prior to and after the formation of HD 109995. Study of interstellar lines will tell about the interstellar gas in a direction nearly perpendicular to the Galactic plane and any slight reddening of this star. The statistical quality Of the individual images must be improved to justify exhaustive quantitative analysis and thus we propose to obtain additional high dispersion SWP and LWP images.|Y

We propose observations of 22 Vul aimed at resolving the controversy over whether the supergiant wind attains terminal velocity before reaching the B star orbit.|Y
ACIRP|Accretion Disks in Massive Binaries|Ronald S.|Polidan|Arizona|We propose to obtain eclipse observations of two active binary stars: V356 Sgr and TT Hya to investigate the accretion disks in these systems. The observations will provide the data necessary to 1) determine the flux distribution(s) of the accretion disk, 2) the radial distribution of luminosity in the disk, and 3) the location of the line formation regions(s) of the high ionization UV emission lines observed in these binaries. The binary star V453 Sco will be investigated to establish the characteristics of the massive, invisible secondary object (star or accretion disk) in the system. All IUE observation will have simultaneous Voyager far-UV (500-1700 A) support and attempts will be made to obtain simultaneous optical observations. Isolated observations of the eclipsing binary stars BD+28 3434, and XY Pup are also proposed. All data will be compared with existing accretion disk observations of other binary systems and accretion disk models of Wade (1984).|Y
ACLFB|C IV in A Stars: Bridging the Gap Between Early and Late-Type stars|Frederick C.|Bruhweiler|Catholic U|Recent results indicate that normal, single main sequence stars as late as Al show C IV and Si IV which are definitely stellar in origin. Since these stars are too cool to produce these ions, these ions must be formed in a hot (70,000 K) plasma above the stellar photospheres. Also, chromospheric activity has been seen in Altair (A7 V), along with X-ray emission, presumably arising in a hot corona. What lies in the gap between Al and A7? We will search for C IV and Si IV in normal single main-sequence A stars within the narrow temperature range corresponding to A2-A7. This will be done using the SWP at high dispersion. Detection of C IV and/or Si IV in even one star would suggest that the mechanisms producing these ions may be overlapping in hot and cool stars. Moreover, this would necessitate a rethinking of the physical processes that are thought to give rise to these ions. High dispersion observations of HD 20888 (A3 V) and Altair (A7 V) are of highest priority.|Y
ACPEG|Activity Cycles in Stars with Highly Active Chromospheres|Edward F.|Guinan|Villanova University|The extended lifetime of the IUE satellite has provided an unique and unanticipated opportunity to examine the long-term evolution of magnetic activity on active chromospheric stars. We propose to obtain further IUE observations of the highly active RS CVn stars V711 Tauri, lambda Andromedae, II Pegasi, and UX Arietis in conjunction with groundbased optical and radio observations, and possibly ROSAT X-ray observations. In addition we would continue IUE observations of the unusual rapidly rotating early G giant, FK Comae, which, although not in the RS CVn category, shares a similarly high level of magnetic activity. These five stars have the most extensive IUE archival coverage for stars of their type and have almost continuous ground-based photometric coverage from about 1975 onward. We aim to trace the long-term development of magnetic activity on these stars: a detailed study of the UV emission-like fluxes will enable us to follow the variations in chromospheric and transition-region activity over an interval of 12-16 years. Optical observations reveal variations in photospheric (starspot) activity: the starspot regions are large (up to 30% of the stellar surface) and vary significantly with time. The main aim of the proposed research is to examine the relationship between chromospheric, transition-region, and photospheric active regions. Elucidation of the role of white-light faculae vis-a-vis spots in effecting stellar irradiance changes is also desirable.|Y
ADIFW|Transition Regions in A Dwarfs|Frederick M.|Walter|Colorado - CASA|Strong chromospheric and transition region emission is seen in stars as blue as B-V = .31 on the main sequence. Standard models indicate that subphotospheric convection ceases for stars only slightly bluer than this point on the main sequence, and that solar-like chromospheres should not exist in hotter stars. Yet there is no direct observational evidence that this is the case. We propose to observe a sample of single late A-early F dwarfs (.20<=B-V<=.32) to attempt to establish where in the HR diagram chromospheres cease to exist. We shall do this with deep SWP-LO exposures to look for CII 1335 emission. CII will be easily detectable in all our targets if the surface flux is comparable to that seen in early F (.32</=B-V</=.39) dwarfs. The CII surface flux levels in the late A dwarfs can be used to decide whether the TRs in these stars are heated acoustically or magnetically, as magnetic heating should cease blue ward of B-V=.3 when the convective zone becomes very thin and dynamos should not be able to operate, whereas acoustic heating driven by waves generated by a very shallow convective zone should be maximum near B-V=.25.|Y
ADOAC|The Precessing Accretion Disk in the Black-Hole Binary LMC X-3|Anne P.|Cowley|Arizona State University|It has recently been shown that the X-ray luminosity of the black-hole binary LMC X-3 is strongly modulated with a ~198-day period. Optical photometry also shows this same periodicity, superimposed on 1.7-day ellipsoidal variations, although phase shifted with respect to the X-ray light curve. The highly regular character of this modulation over many years suggests it originates from a "clock" in the system, most likely a precessing accretion disk similar to those in Her X-1 or SS433. Observations in the ultraviolet where the disk is readily detected, become an important way to learn more about the physical properties of this unusual system. However, observing timesmust be carefully selected to allow us to deconvolve the short- and long-term variations. In order to study the long-term variability, we have chosen to make observations at a fixed orbital phase (quadrature). Three shifts were awarded last year (two of these spectra have already been taken) to supplement three suitable archival spectra. This small number of IUE spectra shows that the UV varies by more than a factor of two and that there are systematic UV spectral-index changes through the precession period. Additional IUE spectra are needed to obtain more complete long-term phase coverage of these changes and to sample shorterterm flux variability which may be orbital or irregular. We emphasize that LMC X-3 is a unique and important IUE target.|Y

AEETS|Temporal Changes in the Ultraviolet Spectrum of Ab Aur|Theodore|Simon|Hawaii|The Herbig Ae star, AB Aur, is believed to be a pre-main-sequence star, a higher mass counterpart of the T Tauri stars. It is the brightest (by 2-3 mags.) of the known Ae stars. AB Aur shows variable emission at Ca II K and HeI 5876 (Praderie et al. 1982). This emission may arise in an active chromosphere. Strong variations are observed in the Balmer lines of H I and the Ca II K line over time periods of days, months, and years, indicating surface activity, global motions, and mass flow. A short-lived, possibly flarelike event has also been observed in a strong, blue displaced component in the Balmer lines and Ca II K. Strong P Cygni profiles at Mg II h and k are evidence of a high velocity stellar wind.  We propose to search on time scales the order of the rotation period (Prot 41 hours) for both rotational modulation in the P Cygni profiles of the Mg II h and k lines, and for flare-like activity. In conjunction with an ESA shift, we can continuously monitor these key spectral features to search for changes in the stellar wind and chromosphere of AB Aur.|Y
AEHJL|Chromospheric and Transition Region Line Profiles of the Herbig EA Star HR 5999|Jeffery L.|Linsky|Colorado|We propose to obtain a long (14-16 hour), high dispersion SWP-HI exposure of the Herbig Ae star, HR 5999. This A7111e pre-main sequence star shows strong chromospheric and transition region emission lines, which is a most unusual occurrence. We will use this exposure to study the dynamical processes and energy transport and deposition mechanisms in the chromosphere and transition region. The level of turbulent non-thermal line broadening and its variation with emission-line formation temperature will be investigated. From an analysis of the observed line profiles and any measurable line shifts we will investigate the properties of the stellar wind from HR 5999 in regions close to the star. From such studies we would hope to understand the nature of the chromosphere and transition region of HR 5999 and why these regions are present in a star which theoretically should have no or only a thin sub-photospheric convection zone.|Y
AEITS|Variability of HD 163296|Theodore|Simon|Hawaii|A time series of high resolution IUE spectra of the pre-main sequence star AB Aur has revealed that the blue-wing velocity of the Mg II resonance lines varies sinusoidally with a period of 45 hours. The derived period is close to the expected rotation period of this star. This recent discovery provides the first direct evidence of a nonaxisymmetric wind in an A type pre-main sequence object. The IUE observations establish a strong argument for a solar-wind type of model in which a pattern of fast and slow streams originates from an inhomogeneous distribution of active regions at the stellar surface. As the star rotates, these -fast and slow streams alternate along the line of sight and modulate the blue wing velocity of the Mg II lines.  We now propose to study the variability of the Mg II lines of the Herbig A0 Ve star HD 163296 in a timing study similar to our previous investigation of AB Aur. HD 163296 shows strong variability in its Mg II line profiles, but on an as yet unknown time scale. Since the rotation period of this star is close to 48 hours, it is the best candidate for testing whether the inhomogeneous corotating wind model applies to other Herbig Ae/Be stars besides AB Aur.|Y
AEKCI|Physical Properties of the Extended Atmospheres of Herbig AE/BE Stars|Catherine L.|Imhoff|CSC IUE|IUE spectra of Herbig Ae and Be stars have shown that the stellar atmospheres of these massive pre-main sequence stars (PMS) stars differ dramatically from those observed in normal A and B stars or in the "classical" Be stars. In our SADAP archival study we have found that Herbig Ae/Be stellar winds are denser, extend to higher velocities, and cover a wider range in ionization than those seen in more evolved stars. The IUE data show that these stars have a wide range of wind profile characteristics, degree of line blanketing by shell absorption features, and amount of chromospheric emission.  Observations of a number of stars are needed to separate the trends in wind and chromosphere behavior as a function of spectral type and stellar luminosity from those properties which appear to be peculiar to individual objects. Inspection of the available catalogs of Herbig Ae/Be stars with reliable stellar data indicates that only 13 of these bona fide massive PMS stars are observable by IUE in high dispersion. Moderate to high S/N high dispersion data are available for seven of these stars. We propose augmenting the IUE archives by observations of the remaining six stars. Four of the proposed targets have not previously been observed by IUE in high dispersion. The other targets have very low S/N spectra.  The data resulting from this study, together with the available archival data, will be analyzed to determine whether winds from these objects exhibit departures from spherical symmetry, as evidenced by dramatically different H-alpha and Mg II profiles and by the presence of large ionization gradients in the wind. We will also evaluate the data to constrain wind acceleration mechanisms for these objects, by looking for signatures of departures from simple radiatively-driven winds. Chromospheric emission fluxes or upper limits will be derived for the Ae stars in our program.|Y
AENJB|Multiband Observations of the Flares on AE Aquarii|Jay A.|Bookbinder|Harvard CFA - SAO|Magnetic cataclysmic variables (those containing a strongly magnetized white dwarf), offer unique opportunities for study of accretion processes. One of the best studied magnetic CVs - AE Aquarii - is well-known for it's striking optical flares. It also possesses similar flares at radio and UV wavelengths with a large degree of variability on timescales significantly shorter than the orbital period of 9.9 hours. The origin of the flares may be associated with disruption of the accretion disk at the Alfven radius of the white dwarf, we can determine whether the various emitting regions are causally related by studying the correlation of the variability in these wavelength regimes. We propose to use IUE, with simultaneous ROSAT PSPC (X-ray), optical (KPNO), and radio (VLA and IRAM) observations, to characterize the flaring activity and test this hypothesis. These data will constrain models of the accretion and flare processes in CVs as well as their more energetic counterparts, the close X-ray binaries. We expect the ROSAT observations (50 ksec of "category c" time) to be spaced over two consecutive days. Thus, 2 US1 shifts each followed by the first half of a US2 shift will provide the requisite UV data for this project.|Y
AENMP|MG II Lines as Diagnostic of PMS Nature in Herbig Ae/Be Stars|Mario R.|Perez|CSC - IUE Observatory|We propose to observe some newly discovered and previously unobserved Herbig Ae/Be (HAB) stars with IUE. All proposed targets are bright enough for observations in the high-dispersion mode. Furthermore, three of these stars are brighter than any other previously recognized member of the HAB class.  Our main objective is to study the structure of the Mg II resonance lines among these HAB objects. A previous archival study indicated that there is a full range of profiles in the Mg II lines, from the double peak emission to the narrow absorption lines. We argue that the structure of the Mg II lines is a superior diagnostic of the dynamical activity and ultimately of the PMS nature of these objects. This is a crucial test for the characterization of the HAB stars.|Y
AFBNM|IUE Ultraviolet Observations of A- and F-Type Supergiants|Nancy D.|Morrison|Toledo|The goal of the proposed observations is to determine mass-loss rates for A- and F-type supergiants, which are massive stars that have evolved away from the zero-age main sequence. Resonance lines of Mg II and Fe II between 2500 and 3000 A will be studied. The observational quantities of interest are the equivalent widths and the Doppler shift of these lines, which (in simplified terms) can be interpreted as the number of absorbing atoms and the velocity of the absorbing material, respectively. Our analytical approach will be to compute line profiles for a grid of model envelopes and to select the model that best matches the observed profile. Any model that we take to represent the envelope and hence to give the mass-loss rate will also have to satisfy constraints imposed by spectral features observed in the visible, such as H alpha. These IUE observations are an important part of a larger program, which will also use ground-based data, to improve our knowledge of the structure of supergiant atmospheres.|Y
AFEBV|Ultraviolet Observations of A and F Stars|Erika|Bohm Vitense|Washington|There are two main points of interest for which the IUE would be very helpful (1) line identification in A Stars. High resolution spectra of Vega / Sirius and --Cyg would permit the line identification. (2) Termination of Hydrogen Convection. The observation of the effects of stellar chromospheres may give us information about the termination point of the hydrogen convection. |Y
AFFJL|The Rotation-Activity Correlations for Early F Dwarfs|Jeffrey L.|Linsky|Colorado - JILA|As one proceeds down the main sequence, convection first becomes important in the early F stars. It is now well established that by spectral type F8V, dynamogenerated magnetic fields are an important factor in heating stellar chromospheres and coronae. Stars later than F8V exhibit clear relations between the stellar rotation rate and the level of chromospheric and coronal activity as measured by the strength of emission features. On the other hand, F2-F5 dwarfs exhibit no such relations at coronal temperatures, despite coronal activity levels (Lx/Lbol ) two orders of magnitude larger than for the A-B stars. We propose to investigate the transition from the early type atmospheres to the chromospheres and coronae of the later type stars by studying the UV line emission from a sufficiently large and representative sample of Fl-F7 dwarfs with known Vsini. We seek to determine at what effective temperature (as indicated by B-V or V-R) the rotation-activity relations become apparent. With a sample of stars of similar Vsini, we shall study how the increasing depth of the convective zone influences the activity levels. Among the bluest stars that will likely exhibit no rotation-activity correlation, we also plan to investigate how stellar age may influence stellar activity levels. Finally, we will investigate the relationship between chromospheric and transition region emission in early F stars, in order to test current theoretical ideas about the structure and energy balance of stellar atmospheres.|Y
AFFNM|A-Type Supergiants: Three Unique Spectra|Nancy D.|Morrison|Toledo|IUE observations of a newly discovered H-alpha-emission star, which has an classification in the range A21a to A51a, are proposed. Since this object is at galactic latitude b = +20 it is probably not a true supergiant. A high-dispersion LWR spectrum will contribute key information toward the determination of the nature of this object.  The A-type supergiants 6 Cas and 9 Per have never been observed at high dispersion with the SWP camera, and acquisition of such a spectrum is proposed for both stars. These spectra will be used in a comprehensive model-atmosphere study of the. photospheres of A-type supergiants.|Y
AFGEB|Ultraviolet Spectra of Gamma Boo Stars|Erika|Bohm-Vitense|U Washington|Lambda Boo stars show abnormally weak metallic lines for their spectral type, if this is determined from the ratio of the CaII K to hydrogen line strength, yet they are no population II stars as shown by their low space velocities and by their apparently large rotational velocities which are around 100 km/sec. (Baschek and Searle,.1969). Spectrum analysis shows a metal deficiency except that OI has normal abundances and CI seems to be actually overabundant (Saschek et al 1983). The UV spectra suggest that another light source is contributing to the continuous light. It appears that the strong CI lines seen in the Lambda Boo uv spectrum may be formed in a shell of carbon rich material. We want to observe additional lambda Boo stars in order to see whether this interpretation fits all lambda Boo stars. We would like to re-observe lambda Boo in order to see whether time variations in the CI lines can be observed, which would support the interpretation as envelope lines. We want to study in detail the binary ADS 3910 which contains one A Boo star and one apparently normal B8V star (Sargent, 1966).|Y
AFGJL|Completion of F Dwarf Activity Relations Study|Jeffrey L.|Linsky|Colorado - JILA|We propose to complete our study of chromospheric and transition region fluxes in early F dwarfs begun under program AFFJL. We are studying the correlations between chromospheric surface fluxes and rotation, age, and color (indicative of the depth of the convective zone), using SWP spectra to obtain fluxes for emission lines formed at temperatures of -8000 K (01) through 200,000 K (NV). We need a complete grid of stars in the (BV)-(Vsini) plane to determine at what color the dynamo turns on (the activity begins to correlate with Vsini), and to see how activity levels at a fixed Vsini are affected by convection zone depth and stellar age, in case of a contribution from a decaying primordial magnetic field in the youngest stars. Completion of the program (25% of the SWP spectra requires 6 shifts. We also request 4 shifts to observe four young (~7x10^7 yrs) F dwarfs in the Pleiades Cluster, specifically to study the dependence of activity levels upon age in very young stars not available in the field or in the Ursa Major or Hyades Clusters which have already been studied. We believe that the completion of this program during the seventh year of IUE will lead to a major increase in our understanding of F dwarf chromospheres and transition regions, and provide real guidance in formulating observing strategies for the observation of these stars by Space Telescope. |Y
AFGSA|The Population II A Type Star HD 109995|Saul J.|Adelman|The Citadel|We propose to derive in a thorough self-consistent analysis of the ultraviolet and optical data the photospheric elemental abundances of the Population II A type star HD 109995. The use of IUE data will allow a more complete coverage of the periodic table than is possible with the optical spectra alone and also will allow consistency checks between the two wavelength domains. Comparison with the results of our previous studies of Population I B and A stars and with the predictions of astrophysical theories will yield information on the mixing of CNO processed material into the stellar envelope during red-qiant stage evolution and on the nucleosynthetic evolution of heavier elements and enrichment of the interstellar medium prior to and after the formation of HD 109995. Study of the interstellar lines will tell about the interstellar gas in a direction nearly perpendicular to the Galactic plane as well as reveal any slight reddening of this star. The statistical quality of the individuaql images must be improved to justify exhaustive quantitative analysis and thus we propose to obtain at least three high dispersion images at each of several exposure levels in SWP and in LWR.|Y
AFNTS|Chromospheric Activity in A and F Stars|Theodore|Simon|U Hawaii|Existing IUE observations have established that the late A- and early early F-type stars exhibit chromospheric and transition region emission as intense as that of much cooler and more deeply convective dwarf stars like the Sun. It is suspected that the source of this chromospheric heating in the early-type dwarfs is the shock dissipation of acoustic waves, not the MHD waves implicated in solar activity. Theoretical calculations predict that the acoustic power available to support nonradiative heating should peak near spectral type F0 V, and then should decrease towards higher effective temperatures along the main sequence, falling by an order of magnitude among the middle A stars. Observations of C II and Lyman-alpha suggest that the UV activity of A and F stars may reach such a peak near spectral type F0 V before declining to lower levels among the late and middle A stars. However, the number of detected stars is small and so the trend in activity among the stars at B - V < 0.29 remains uncertain due to inadequate statistics. At present we cannot certain whether activity drops off more slowly or more rapidly towards higher temperatures than acoustic theory predicts, or whether the two are, in fact, entirely consistent. We intend to correct that situation with additional measurements of C II and Ly-alpha strengths in a sample of late A and early F stars.|Y

AGHAB|UV Observations of Seyfert Galaxies|Albert|Boggess|NASA/GSFC|We propose to obtain high-quality, broadened (equivalent to trailed) spectra for 10 Seyfert galaxies with the IUE. Only broadened IUE spectra have sufficient signal-to-noise ratios to allow the detailed comparison of optical and UV line profiles and detailed fitting of line profiles with model in order to investigate the kinematics, dynamics, and stratification of the emitting regions. These spectra will also allow more accurate measurements of weak spectral features: OI 1304 and He II 1640 are needed to estimate reddening; N IV], O III] 1663 and N III] 1749 are needed for abundance analyses; the Mg II 2800 absorption line can be used for estimating the covering factor of the broad line region (BLR); and Galactic absorption lines of Si II 1260, O I 1260, O I 1304, C II 1335, Si IV 1400, C IV 1550, Fe II 1608, and Mg II 2800 can yield additional information on the Galactic halo. There are also broad features superposed on the spectra of Seyfert galaxies: the 2200A dust absorption feature, the emission hump at 3200A and the Fe II emission between 2280 and 2650A. Their detection, measurement and quantitative study also require spectra recorded with high signal-to-noise ratios. X-ray fluxes are already available for some of the proposed targets, and these data will be combined with our UV continua to estimate the amounts of available ionizing radiation. We also plan to measure the fluxes of the prominent emission lines L-alpha, SI IV 1400, C IV 1550, C III] 1909 and Mg II 2800, to provide a homogeneous set of high quality data to allow the evaluation of models for individual objects instead of, as in the past, for an assumed "typical" Seyfert or quasar. Our previous observations have revealed important differences between the emission line properties of Type I Seyferts and high redshift quasars. The results from these Seyferts will greatly strengthen our data base for further investigation.|Y
AGHCW|UV and Optical Observations of Liners|Chi-Chao|Wu|CSC|We propose ultraviolet studies of a sample of bright Liners, In order to 1) establish whether the observed ultraviolet continuua Indicate sufficient ionizing fluxes to phototonize the gas and produce the emission lines, 2) determine from stellar population synthesis whether the Ionizing continuua can be explained by stars alone, and 3) search for systematic differences in the ultraviolet spectra of Liners whose emission line properties differ In some respects. New observations of 4 Liners will be combined with IUE archival images of 3 Liners. Near-concurrent optical observations will be carried out at ground-based telescopes.|Y
AGHGF|Emission Line Region Kinematics in NGC 1068|Gary J.|Ferland|Kentucky|An allotment of two shifts is requested to determine the kinematic state of the emission line region gas in the classical Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 1068. Each shift would be used to obtain a small aperture high resolution spectrum. These short and long wave spectra will have sufficient velocity resolution to allow both detailed study of the emission line profiles, as well as a comparison between profiles of various lines. A primary goal is a study of the L-alpha profile, which will determine whether the gas is in inflow, outflow, or some mixture of flow and circular motion. Another goal is to determine whether the profiles of lines of different ionization potential and excitation have similar widths and profiles. Such studies cannot be performed on broad line objects because of the difficulty in deconvolving broad and narrow line contributions to the net profile. Among narrow line objects, only NGC 1068 is bright enough for high resolution observations with IUE. These observations should be decisive in settling the debate over the kinematics and dynamics of narrow line region gas.|Y
AGHGR|Simultaneous UV and EUV Observations of Active Galaxies|Gail A.|Reichert|CSC|We propose IUE observations of several nearby AGN, to be performed concurrently with observations using the Voyager 2 UVS, in order to extend our knowledge of their spectra down to rest wavelengths < 900A. Our goals are to 1) develop a self-consistent model of the nuclear region of NGC 1068, 2) test Malkan and Sargent's (1982) decompositions of the ultraviolet spectra of NGC 4151 and 3C 273, and 3) derive more sensitive bounds to the temperatures of any thermal emission (e.g., from accretion disks) which may be present in NGC 4151, Fairall 9, and 3C 273. For 3C 273 and Fairall 9, we will also be able to search for a Lyman cutoff In their continuua.|Y

X-ray fluxes are already available for some of the proposed targets, and these data will be combined with our UV continua to estimate the amounts of available ionizing radiation.

Our previous observations have revealed important differences between the emission line properties of Type I Seyferts and high redshift quasars. The results from these Seyferts will greatly strengthen our data base for further investigation.|Y
AGIBP|AGN Emission Line Region Variability|Bradley M.|Peterson|Ohio St.|We propose to obtain simultaneous optical and ultraviolet observations of the rapidly varying active galaxies Akn 120 and 3C 120. Both of these sources are distinguished by short-time scale (a few days) variations in their continuum and broad-line fluxes, and we intend to exploit this property to determine fundamental characteristics of the emission-line gas. Akn 120 has been studied extensively by the Ohio State group, and is one of the few active galaxies where the separation between the continuum source and emission line clouds is known from reverberation measurements. An important goal of the proposed observations is to exploit these rapidly variable active galaxies to shed light on aspects of the emission-line regions which recent observations have revealed to be poorly understood. In particular, we will examine the profile and variability of the emission feature identified as C III]1909 to determine how much of the flux in this line can be ascribed to species other than C^2. The possibility that the feature may not be C III] is one of the most important recent developments in our understanding of the broad line region, since the intercombination line is the single most important indicator of density (and hence position) of the BLR. These observations will also allow us to make a differential comparison with photoionization models, since the emission-line spectrum will change in response to the variable ionizing continuum flux. Such a differential comparison between observations and theory should be more reliable than attempts to match absolute intensities because errors in the atomic data base should tend to cancel out.|Y
AGICW|UV and Optical Observations of Liners|Chi-Chao|Wu|CSC|We propose ultraviolet studies of a sample of bright Liners, in order to 1) establish whether the observed ultraviolet continua indicate sufficient ionizing fluxes to photoionize the gas and produce the emission lines, 2) determine from stellar population synthesis whether the ionizing continua can be explained by hot stars alone, and 3) search for systematic differences in the ultraviolet spectra of Liners whose emission line properties differ in some respects. New observations of 4 Liners will be combined with IUE archival images of 3 Liners (along with 8th episode observations of 2 other Liners which we have yet to obtain). Near-concurrent optical observations will be carried out at ground-based telescopes.|Y
AGIDW|Comparing Ultraviolet and Infrared Fluxes for Active Galaxies|Daniel W.|Weedman|Penn State|A fundamental problem in understanding the appearance of galaxies at high redshift is to understand how much of the ultraviolet spectrum is absorbed out by dust. The amount of dust absorption and subsequent re-radiation could be determined from far infrared fluxes. This is now possible for many galaxies detected by IRAS. I propose to make ultraviolet flux measures using the IUE archives for the 86 Markarian galaxies previously observed by IUE. These will be compared with IRAS fluxes and with models for the intrinsic continua to determine the fractions of ultraviolet flux which have escaped these galaxies without absorption.|Y
AGIGR|Simultaneous UV and EUV Observations of Active Galaxies|Gail A.|Reichert|CSC|We propose IUE observations of three nearby AGN -- NGC 4151, 3C 273, and Fairall 9 -- to be performed concurrently with observations using the Voyager 2 UVS, in order to extend our knowledge of their spectra down to rest wavelengths 900A.   Our goals are to 1) probe the intrinsic extreme ultraviolet continua of AGN, 2) relate the extreme ultraviolet and ultraviolet continua and thereby test various models for the spectral decomposition of the continuum, 3) search for a (rest frame) Lyman cutoff in the spectra of 3C 273 and Fairall 9, and 4) measure the strengths of the 0 VI 1035 emission lines.|Y
AGIMM|Variability of Bright Seyfert 1 Galaxies and Quasars|Matthew A.|Malkan|CAL LA|Repeated IUE archive spectra already exist for a sample of bright blue variable quasars and Seyfert I galaxies. We will better characterize this population's mean uv intensity distribution, and determine if the uv fluctuations are predominantly positive (flares) or negative (eclipses). We will also better determine the likelihood of a particular amplitude uv fluctuation occuring after a given interval of time. We will examine if the SWP and LWP bands varied together, and if the uv spectrum steepened when fading. A larger sample will allow us to investigate any systematic differences between the uv fluctuations of "normal" quasars, Seyfert I galaxies, compact radio sources, and other types of AGNs. This archive data will indicate if our variability data on eight similar sources, for which we already have simultaneous multiwavelength spectra, are representative of the larger population. For the eight multiwavelength sources, we will determine if the ultraviolet variability is consistent with the spectrum of an accretion disk about a "constant" mass black hole experiencing a variable accretion rate. The archive data will also be used to set an upper limit on short timescale uv variability. The shortest timescale variation attributable to a disk component would set a lower limit on the viscosity, a parameter which determines the entire structure of the disk.|Y
AGJAB|UV Observations of Seyfert Galaxies|Albert|Boggess|NASA/GSFC|We propose to obtain high-quality, widened (equivalent to trailed) spectra for 9 most recently discovered bright Seyfert galaxies with the IUE. Only widened IUE spectra have sufficient signal-to-noise ratio to allow the detailed comparison of optical and UV line profiles and detailed fitting of line profiles with model in order to investigate the kinematics, dynamics, and stratification of the emitting regions. These spectra will also allow more accurate measurements of weak spectral features: O I 1304 and He II 1640 are needed to estimate reddening; N IV] 1486, O III] 1663 and N III] 1749 are needed for abundance analyses; the Mg II 2800 absorption line can be used for estimating the covering factor of the broad line region (BLR); and Galactic absorption lines of Si II 1260, O I 1304, C II 1335, Si IV 1400, C IV 1550, Fe II 1608, and Mg II 2800 can yield additional information on the Galactic halo. There are also broad features superposed on the spectra of Seyfert galaxies: the 2200A dust absorption feature, the emission hump at 3200A and the Fe II emission between 2280 and 2650A. Their detection, measurement and quantitative study also require spectra recorded with high signal-to-noise ratio. X-ray fluxes are already available for 7 of the proposed targets, and these data will be combined with our UV continua to estimate the amounts of available ionizing radiation. We also plan to measure the fluxes of the prominent emission lines L-alpha, Si IV 1400, C IV 1550, C III)  1909 and Mg II 2800, to provide a homogeneous set of high quality data to allow the evaluation of models for individual objects. Our previous observations have revealed important differences between the emission line properties of Type 1 Seyferts and high redshift quasars. The results from these Seyferts will greatly strengthen our data base for further investigation.|Y
AGJBP|Emission-Line Region Variability|Bradley M.|Peterson|Ohio State University|We propose to obtain simultaneous optical and ultraviolet observations of the rapidly varying active galaxies Akn 120 and 3C 120. Both these sources are distinguished by short-time scale variations in their continuum and broadline fluxes, and we intend to exploit this property to determine fundamental characteristics of the emission-line gas. Akn 120 has been studied extensively by the Ohio State group, and is one of the few active galaxies for which a reliable upper limit for the separation between the continuum source and the emission-line clouds has been established from reverberation measurements. The important goals of the proposed project are (1) to provide a suitable database of optical and ultraviolet broad-line flux measurements obtained during different continuum states and (2) to compare the temporal behavior of optical and ultraviolet emission lines. In particular, we wish to determine whether or not C III] A1909 varies on the same time scale as the Balmer lines and how much of the flux in this feature can actually be ascribed to broad-line emission from C^+2. These data will enable us to make a differential comparison with predictions of photoionization models, since the emission-line spectrum will change in response to the variable ionizing continuum flux. Such a differential comparison between observation and theory should be more reliable than attempts to match absolute intensities because errors in the atomic data base should tend to cancel out.|Y
AGJFB|The Nature of the Starburst Knots in NGC 1068|Frederick C.|Bruhweiler|Catholic University|The galaxy, NGC 1068, is the nearest galaxy containing an AGN and is a pronounced starburst galaxy. The central 3 Kpc disk is anomalously bright in the UV. This galaxy is close enough such that the individual starburst knots can be studied with the IUE. Suggestions that nuclear starburst activity is an evolutionary step to AGN formation, underscores the importance of probing with the IUE the relationship between starbursts and AGNs. Besides providing a complete UV map of the UV-bright regions of the disk, our study will utilize new data reduction techniques to extract reliable spectra and flux distributions in IUE large aperture exposures of multiple sources, and also to detect very weak extended nebular emission. This should enable us to place constraints on stellar content and ages of these knots. We will determine the nature and extent of the unusually strong N V and C IV emission previously seen in knots 12" NE of the nucleus. If this emission is due to supernova remnants, it may be the strongest of any yet observed with the IUE.  We also will determine the extent and nature of the UV continuum crown which surrounds the central source. This study is expected to have important implications on understanding the relationship between AGNs and starburst galaxies and to provide clues to the mechanisms producing emission in Type 2 Seyferts.|Y
AGJGR|Simultaneous UV and EUV Observations of Active Galaxies|Gail A.|Reichert|CSC|We propose IUE observations of three nearby AGN - NGC 4151, 3C 273, and Fairall 9 - to be performed concurrently with observations using the Voyager 2 UVS, in order to extend our knowledge of their spectra down to rest wavelengths 900A. Our goals are to 1) probe the intrinsic extreme ultraviolet continua of AGN, 2) relate the extreme ultraviolet and ultraviolet continua and thereby test various models for the spectral decomposition of the continuum, 3) search for (or verify) a (rest frame) Lyman cutoff in the spectra of 3C 273 and Fairall 9, and 4) estimate (if possible) the strengths of the 0 VI 1035A emission lines.|Y
AGJJS|IUE Studies of Seyfert Galaxies|J. Michael|Shull|Colorado - CASA|We propose IUE observations of two Seyfert galaxies which show variable absorption components in their broad emission lines. These galaxies, NGC 3516 and NGC 4051, provide ideal laboratories for "reverberation analyses" of gas in their broad-line regions. Various authors have attributed these UV absorption lines to an outflowing wind, transit of broad-line clouds, or partial X-ray covering. However, our recent archive study of NGC 3516 (Voit, Begelman, and Shull 1987) shows that the absorption arises in hundreds of optically thin clouds, and not from broad-line gas or X-ray absorbers. Variations of the depth and width of absorption &rise from changes of cloud coverage in velocity space, as additional gas is illuminated by variations in the ionizing continuum. Correlations (or anti-correlations) of the UV absorption with continuum flux may be used to derive the distribution and velocity of these absorbers, using our recently developed theory of the ionization response.  The source of the UV absorbing gas in Seyferts is unknown. It is also unclear why the NGC 3516 absorption shows an anti-correlation with continuum, whereas NGC 4151 shows a correlation. In this year's proposal, we wish to devote two US-1 shifts to NGC 3516 and two US1 shifts to NGC 4051, a relatively unstudied Seyfert with UV absorption lines. We will obtain 4 SWP images on NGC 3516 and use them to better determine the distribution of absorbers via reverberation analysis. For NGC 4051, we will obtain 3 SWP images and I LWP image to see if its absorption varies in C IV, Si IV, and Mg II, if the absorption correlates or anti-correlates with continuum flux, and perhaps understand the link between absorbing gas and Seyfert properties.|Y
AGJMM|Simultaneous UV and Optical Observations of Bright Seyfert 1 Galaxies|Matthew A.|Malkan|UCLA|For the next ten years, the Voyager far ultraviolet (FUV) spectrometer is the only instrument capable of observing the wavelength region where the energy from Seyfert nuclei peaks. We propose to use Voyager and IUE to obtain the first FUV observations of ten of the brightest Seyfert I galaxies. Simultaneous IUE and Voyager observations are crucial for subtracting the background light from the FUV spectra and detecting faint extragalactic sources. Voyager will extend the IUE observations from 1250 down to 912 A, a significant percentage of the remaining continuum. This previously unobserved FUV continuum is critical to our understanding of the energetics of the broad line region it ionizes. The FUV is also the best wavelength region in which to test the diverging predictions of different accretion disk models.  There are hardly any previous FUV observations of AGNs. From our IUE variability program, we have selected the eight Seyferts likely to be brightest below 1200 A and most easily detected by Voyager. Half of these Seyferts have redshifts greater than .03, and their Lyman limits should be measureable redward of the Galaxy's H I absorption.|Y
AGKDC|Narrow-Line Seyfert Galaxies|D. Michael|Crenshaw|CSC IUE|We propose to obtain simultaneous SWP and optical spectra of three unusual Seyfert galaxies that have most of the properties of normal Seyfert I galaxies (high-ionization lines, strong nonstellar continua), but have permitted lines that are much narrower (< 1000 km sec^-1 FWHM). We have obtained test SWP exposures of these objects, and find that total exposure times of 12 - 14 hours should be sufficient to detect many of the weak lines that are blended together in Seyferts with broad (1000 - 6000 km sec^-1 FWHM) lines. We have chosen these three high-ionization narrow-line (HINL) Seyferts because their [OIII] 5007/H-beta ratios are small, which indicates that the emission lines from the low-density region do not severely contaminate those from the high-density region that we wish to study.  We wish to accomplish the following scientific objectives: 1. We will study the relation between the HINL Seyferts and Seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies by determining the L-alpha/H-beta ratios to see if there is a partially ionized zone in the high-density clouds of HINL Seyferts. We will also compare the strengths of the UV continua in these objects with those in Seyfert I and 2 galaxies.  2. We will investigate the possibility that the emission feature at 1909 A is not entirely due to C III], and may receive a contribution from Fe III.  3. We will determine the reddening of the emission lines from the He II 1640/He II 4686 ratio.  4. We will identify as many weak features as possible and measure their relative intensities. In particular, we will attempt to determine the C:N:O abundances from various emission lines.|Y
AGKFB|Probing the NLR and Jet-Like Condensations in NGC 4151|Frederick C.|Bruhweiler|Catholic University|The jet-like 18" extension of knots and the spatially extended "crown" NLR surrounding the nucleus of the nearby, bright Seyfert galaxy, NGC 4151, offers an unique opportunity to probe at UV wavelengths both NLR gas and a jet-like feature eminating from an active galactic nucleus, We have, using the IUE, successfully detected and mapped out the spatial morphology of both C III] and C IV in the jetlike extension (Bruhweiler and Smith 1988). Building on our current work and newly developed data reduction techniques, we are proposing a more detailed study in which we will: a..-) obtain a much deeper exposure of the jet-like condensations to reveal weaker emission and further delineate the flux distribution of C III] and C IV, and b.) isolate and acquire a spectrum of the 3" x 5" NLR crown surrounding the AGN.  The goal of these observations is to answer two basic questions. Can central source photoionization models explain the observed emission in the NLR and the jet-like knots or must some other ionization source (as suggested in our current results for the jet) also be required? Also, do the jet-like knots in NGC 4151 share a similar origin to other jet-like features seen in Seyferts and other AGNs?|Y
AGKGR|Simultaneous UV and EUV Observations of Active Galaxies|Gail A.|Reichert|CSC IUE|We propose IUE observations of six nearby AGN - PG 0804+761, H1143-182, Mrk 817, 4C 34.47, 3C 273, and Fairall 9 - to be performed concurrently with observations using the Voyager 2 UVS, in order to extend our knowledge of their spectra down to rest wavelengths < 900A.  Our goals are to 1) probe the intrinsic extreme ultraviolet continua of AGN, 2) relate the extreme ultraviolet and ultraviolet continua and thereby test various models for the spectral decomposition of the continuum, 3) for the objects with high enough redshifts (PG 0803+761, 4C 34.47, 3C 273, and possibly Fairall 9), search for (or verify) the presence of rest frame Lyman continuum absorption, and 4) estimate (if possible) the strengths of the O VI 1035A emission lines.  We propose to obtain 12 SWP and LWP images (one of each for each object) with reasonably good signalto-noise in the continuum. We estimate that this will require 3 US1 shifts for our 6 targets. Alternatively, two of the shifts could be profitably scheduled as half-US1 shifts, to accommodate the large consortium monitoring of NGC 5548. In that case, we would request 4 half-US1 shifts and 1 entire US1 shift for the proposed observations.|Y
AGKMM|Structure of the BIR in NGC 5548|Matthew A.|Malkan|UCLA|This is a Large Project proposal to NASA and ESA/SERC which will require a combined allocation of 66 half  IUE shifts (36 half US1's and 30 half shifts from VILSPA) to obtain the first complete set of regular spectroscopic monitoring observations of a variable Seyfert I nucleus - NGC 5548. The function of this large collaboration is to obtain and reduce all the data with uniform procedures, for rapid distribution to all interested researchers. Our observations of the line and continuum variations are expected to result in the first accurate measurement of the BLR size and structure. This will allow a critical test of photoionization models of active galactic nuclei. It will also yield the best power spectrum of continuum fluctuations obtained to date. This campaign will be coordinated with a complete set of monitoring observations at longer wavelengths with ground-based telescopes. The unique set of multiwavelength data will be invaluable to the accomplishment of secondary objectives such as understanding the emission mechanisms which produce the continuum. The principal scientific objectives of this project cannot be met with an allocation of significantly less time than we request.|Y
AGLCM|Search for Correlated UV and X-Ray Absorption in NGC 3516|D. Christopher|Martin|Col. Astro Lab|The  Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 3516 displays rapid, variable absorption in the CIV resonance line and in the x-ray. The origin of the absorbers in each case, and its relationship to other components of the nuclear region is still poorly understood. We propose to supplement planned x-ray observations of this galaxy with GINGA with IUE observations, in order to investigate the relationship between the UV and x-ray absorption phenomena. Our goal is to determine whether the absorption occurs in common or closely related components, and by doing so to further constrain the ionization, density, and location of the absorbers.|Y
AGLDH|Coordinated Multiwavelength Studies of Blazars|Donald J.|Hutter|CSC|We propose to obtain IUE spectra of two Blazars (0735+178 and I Zw 187) as part of a program of coordinated, simultaneous observations of these sources in the uv, X-ray, visible, and radio regions for the purpose of studying the instantaneous spectral energy distribution of each object by comparison with previous high quality multiwaveband spectra. These multi-epoch data will be used to determine whether source models can be made which describe multiple sets of observations for each Blazar in a consistent and physically meaningful way, and to determine the degree of similarity in or difference between the general characteristics of the models for the various sources. Problems relating to the known lack of uniqueness in models based on data from a single epoch can be addressed through repeated sampling of the multiwavelength spectra to reveal the evolution in the overall shape of the flux distribution with time.|Y
AGLGM|Ultraviolet Study of Markarian 1126|Gordon M.|MacAlpine|Michigan|I propose a careful investigation of the ultraviolet (IUE SWP camera) spectrum for the active galaxy Mrk 1126, which has unusually narrowline Seyfert 1 type optical characteristics with no measurable FeII emission. The objectives of this project are: (1) to determine whether Mrk 1126 is similar in nature to Mrk 359, for which the ultraviolet spectrum implies gas physical, dynamical or geometrical conditions fundamentally different from any other recognized Seyfert I galaxy and (2) to analyze the physical and chemical conditions in the lineemitting gas of Mrk 1126 for comparison with other Seyfert I galaxies.|Y
AGLGR|UV and Optical Observations of Liners|Gail A.|Reichert|CSC|Recently developed software now allows us to use the known spatial responses of the IUE cameras to separate the nuclear ultraviolet emission in Liners from the more extended emission arising from integrated starlight. Application of the technique to the long wavelength spectra of two Liners, NGC 0404 and NGC 3998, has produced some intriguing but inconclusive results. Short wavelength spectra of higher signal to noise are required before any definitive statements concerning the nature of the nuclear emission can be made. The technique has obvious potential for studies of other Liners as well. We propose new observations of four Liners - NGC 3998, 4579, 2681, and M81 - in order to obtain SWP (and LWP) spectra of high enough quality that the nuclear and extended emission can be separated. Our aims are to study the component spectra to 1) establish whether the observed ultraviolet continuua within the nuclei indicate sufficient ionizing fluxes to photoionize the gas and produce the emission lines, 2) determine from stellar population synthesis and/or comparison with the ultraviolet spectra of other galaxies whether the nuclear emission can be explained by hot stars alone, 3) measure the strengths of ultraviolet emission lines (especially in NGC 3998), in order to determine the physical state of the gas and obtain clues concerning the ionization mechanism, and 4) search for systematic differences in the ultraviolet spectra of Liners whose emission Line properties differ in some respects. For the SWP spectra, we will require exposures of 16 hours; these will give us nearly optimally exposed spectra. Our European collaborators are submitting a related proposal to ESA. Contemporaneous LWP exposures are needed to ensure that the long and short wavelength spectra refer to the same stars; single shifts will be adequate for these. We are requesting a total of 11 shifts (6 NASA, 5 Vilspa). Near-concurrent optical observations will continue to be carried out at ground-based telescopes.|Y

AGLTC|Multispectral Monitoring of Markarian 509|Timothy E.|Carone|Arizona|In our effort to understand the relationship between the far UV/UV ionizing continuum and the UV/optical emission line regions as well as characterizing changes in the ionizing continuum and its effect on the emission line regions, we are proposing to perform multispectral observations of the Seyfert I galaxy Markarian 509. The overall goal of this proposal is to monitor for one month the continuum and emission lines of Markarian 509 with the UVS, IUE and ground-based telescopes, thereby covering the 912-8400 A spectraI region. Coverage with IUE is necessary for two reasons: (1) the IUE continuum flux and slope will substantiate and complement that found with the UVS and (2) the IUE and optical spectral ranges contain many emission lines that are important diagnostics in determining the amount of ionizing flux present. Acquisition of the continuum from both spacecraft am a necessary condition for an accurate continuum determination but each is not sufficient in itself.|Y
AGLWS|UV-Bracketted X-Ray Observations of Agns|Wei-Hsin|Sun|NASA/GSFC|This is a Large Project proposal to NASA requesting a total of 12 US1 shifts of IUE to observe, jointly with the Japanese X-ray satellite GINGA, the UV/X-ray variabilities in two Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), to study the nature of the emission mechanisms responsible for the hard X-rays and the UV continuum. Each X-ray observation is to be bracketted by continuous UV monitoring. Light curves in UV and X-rays at fine/medium temporal resolution will be constructed. Any signatures of correlated variability will allow a critical test of the nature of the hard X-ray photons and will apply severe constraints on the current scenarios of the connections between the UV and the hard X-ray continuum sources. This campaign will also be coordinated with a complete set of simultaneous observations at longer wavelengths (optical and IR) using ground-based telescopes. This unique set of multiwavelength data will be invaluable in achieving several secondary objectives, such as understanding the UV/optical emission line variations in response to X-ray continuum fluctuations, the correlation between the X-ray Fe emission line and the UV/optical line and continuum properties, and the origin of the soft X-ray excess.|Y
AGMBP|Spectral Energy Distribution in MRK 590|Bradley M.|Peterson|Ohio State|We propose to make multi-wavelength observations of the Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk 590 to determine the spectral energy distribution in this object. The emission-line strengths can be used to deduce the continuum strength in otherwise unobservable parts of the spectrum; this particular galaxy is of special interest because the bases of the broad emission lines behave differently from the line cores, thus providing an especially sensitive probe of the ionizing continuum as well as the gas in the immediate vicinity of the continuum source.|Y
AGMBW|A First Complete View of the Big Blue Bump in Quasar Continua|Belinda J.|Wilkes|Harvard SAO - CFA|The most striking feature in the continuum energy distributions of quasars and active galaxies is the "big blue bump" which dominates the energy output through the optical and UV, and may extend into the soft X-ray region. The feature has been successfully modelled as thermal emission from an accretion disk with a range of temperatures but the models are poorly constrained and not unique and thus remain unproven. The opportunity to use IUE in conjunction with the ROSAT all-sky survey, with its much improved soft X-ray response (*3 sensitivity and *2 energy resolution cf. Einstein) gives us a first excellent chance to simultaneously study the full UV to soft X-ray continuum with the addition of a constraint in the XUV region for two interesting objects from our quasar sample (Wilkes and Elvis 1987). We also plan to obtain simultaneous optical data for further constraint.|Y
AGMCG|A Combined IUE-ROSAT Investigation of Select Seyfert 1 Galaxies|C. Martin|Gaskell|Michigan|The all-sky survey by ROSAT will provide unique opportunities which might not become available again for quite a number of years to get simultaneous or near simultaneous coverage of the X-ray, UV and optical regions of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We propose to make pseudo-trailed IUE observations and get ground-based spectra as close as possible to times when ROSAT is observing 5 Seyfert- I galaxies to help determine the shape of the X-ray to UV continuum. This will enable us to constrain one of the main parameters in photoionization models of AGNs better and reduce ambiguities in interpretations of the physical conditions in AGNs. We have chosen three groups of potential targets, two groups represent opposite extremes of UV line ratios and the third group has more average (and typical) UV line ratios. From our combined observations we expect to be able to understand how the variety of broad line region spectra arise. We hope to be able to advance significantly our knowledge of broad line regions and the ionizing radiation fields in AGNs.|Y
AGMDC|Simultaneous IUE and GHRS Observations of Seyfert 1 Galaxies|D. Michael|Crenshaw|NASA/GSFC|We propose to obtain simultaneous IUE and GHRS (Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph) observations of three Seyfert 1 galaxies. The GHRS data will be obtained during cycles 0 and 1 of a Guaranteed Time Observers (GTO) program with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), and will consist of high-resolution spectra of the UV emission lines in these Seyferts. The IUE spectra are needed to determine the continuum fluxes, establish the continuum level beneath the emission lines, and to measure the broad Fe II emission in the long-wavelength region. Since the broad emission lines and continua in Seyfert 1 galaxies are variable, the IUE observations should be made within a few days of the HST observations if possible.  With high-resolution (R = 2000 to 20,000) GHRS spectra of the emission lines and low resolution (R = 200 to 400) IUE spectra to establish the continuum levels, the following problems will be addressed: 1) The broad and narrow components of the strong emission lines will be deconvolved; this is extremely difficult to do with low-resolution IUE spectra alone. Separate fluxes from the broad- and narrow-line regions will be determined for comparison with photoionization models.  2) The broad-line profiles will be extracted for comparison with kinematic models, and various line ratios will be determined as a function of radial velocity to study the manner in which the physical conditions change across the broad-line region.  3) Many of the weak UV emission lines and emission lines from optical spectra will be compared to estimate the reddening along the line of sight, and to provide further clues to the chemical composition, density, and ionization parameter in the emission-line regions.  4) Absorption lines produced in or near the broad-line region will be looked for to obtain information on cloud motion and the covering factor.|Y

AGMGR|UV and Optical Observations of Liners|Gail A.|Reichert|CSC - GHRS|Recently developed software now allows us to use the known spatial responses of the IUE cameras to separate the nuclear ultraviolet emission in LINERs from the more extended emission axising from integrated starlight. Application of the technique to the long wavelength spectra of three LINERs, NGC 0404, NGC 3998, and NGC 4579, has produced some intriguing results. Short wavelength spectra of higher signal to noise are required, however, before the origin(s) of the nuclear emission can be determined. The technique has obvious potential for studies of other LINERs as well. We propose new observations of four LINERs - NGC 4438, 4594, 2681, and M81 - in order to obtain SWP and LWP) spectra of high enough quality that the nuclear and extended emission can be separated. Our aims are to study the component spectra to 1) establish whether the observed ultraviolet continuua, within the nuclei indicate sufficient ionizing fluxes to photoionize the gas and produce the emission lines, 2) determine from stellar population synthesis and/or comparison with the ultraviolet spectra of "normal" galaxies whether the nuclear emission can be explained by hot stars alone, 3) measure the strengths of ultraviolet emission lines, in order to determine the physical state of the gas and obtain clues concerning the ionization mechanism, and 4) search for systematic differences in the ultraviolet spectra of LINERs whose emission line properties differ in some respects. For the SWP spectra, we will require exposures of 16 hours; these will give us nearly optimally exposed spectra. Our European collaborators are submitting a related proposal to ESA. Contemporaneous LWP exposures are needed to ensure that the long and short wavelength spectra refer to the same stars; single shifts will be adequate for these. We are requesting a total of 11 shifts (6 NASA, 5 Vilspa). Near-concurrent optical observations will continue to be carried out at ground-based telescopes.|Y
AGMJS|Absorption-Line Studies of Seyfert Galaxies|J. Michael|Shull|Colorado - CASA|We propose to undertake a "reverberation analysis" of the variable absorption lines ill two Seyfert Galaxies (NGC 4051 and Mrk 279) to help understand the origin of intrinsic absorption lines in AGNs. Stich an analysis is a powerful tool for elucidating the radial distribution of absorbing gas in the broad-line region (BLR) and narrow-line region (NLR). Only two Seyferts have previously been studied with this technique: NGC 4151 (Bromage el al. 1985; Clavel et al. 1987) and NGC 3516 (Voit, Shull, and Begelman 1987). The absorption features have been interpreted as an outflow of ionized clouds from the nuclear region or from an accretion disk affected by UV/X-ray heating.  Neither the source of the absorbing gas in these Seyferts nor the "gene" which distingishes them from other Seyferts is known. Until the 1984 onset of absorption in Mrk 279, broad self-absorbed. lines had been observed only in Seyferts of low intrinsic luminosity, such as NGC 4051. Mrk 279 is intrinsically much brighter, and therefore more quasar-like, than the other three absorptionline Seyfert I's in the CfA sample. Thus, it may show how the absorption phenomenon changes at higher luminosity and could bridge the gap between the low luminosity absorption-line Seyferts and the well-studied broad absorption-line (BAL) QSO's. In addition, Mrk 279's significant redshift will allow us to study, for the first time, the Ly-alpha line in an absorption-line Seyfert. With 3 US-1 shifts for each of these two underobserved Seyferts, we can double the number of objects in which absorption-line variability has been studied and investigate why the absorption-line strengths correlate or anti-correlate with the UV continuum.|Y
AGMJW|Observations of AGN During Outbursts|James R.|Webb|CSC - IUE|Variability is the least understood characteristic of AGN's, especially the rapid, high amplitude flares seen in blazars. We propose to obtain IUE spectra of a blazar during the critical stages of an outburst. This will be done by monitoring 17 blazars with a dedicated ground-based optical instrument until a flare in one of the them is detected. The target of opportunity program will then be activated and UV spectra of the bursting source will be obtained as quickly as possible. Standard IUE AGN programs are not flexible enough to obtain critical outburst observations because flares are unpredictable and the rise to maximum light timescales can be as short as several days. We are in a unique position to detect an outburst and almost immediately observe it with IUE. Current outburst models involving shocks can be tested most easily by observing optical-UV spectral changes during the rise to maximum light. With ground-based UBV photometry and IUE spectra, it will be possible to provide insight into the mechanism responsible for the energetic outbursts seen in blazars.|Y

AGMMM|Multi-Wavelength Variability of Ecliptic Pole Active Galactic Nuclei|Matthew A.|Malkan|UCLA|We propose to use simultaneous IUE and ROSAT observations to obtain the first monitoring on intermediate time-scales ( < a month) of simultaneous UV and X-ray flux and spectral variability for the 6 brightest ecliptic pole AGNs. We are collaborating with Truemper, Fink, and Zimmerman on the X-ray data, and with several ground-based observers to obtain complete simultaneous optical, IR, and radio data. Observations in the UV band are vital since this dominates the energy budgets of many of these AGNs. This will be the first simultaneous multi-wavelength AGN monitoring program which can detect correlated variations and lags, and test thermal and non-thermal explanations of the UV and X-ray continuum. Several accretion disk models have been advanced to explain the UV and soft X-ray fluxes; they are best tested by searching for correlated variability. There will not be a comparable opportunity to obtain such coordinated multi- wavelength monitoring on intermediate time-scales for the rest of this century.|Y
AGMRE|Two Complete Active Galaxy Samples: The 12 Micron and CFA Seyfert 1S|Richard A.|Edelson|Colorado - CASA|We request six US 1 shifts to complete the IUE observations of two complete samples of Seyfert 1/quasars: the 12 micron-selected sample of Spinoglio and Malkan (1989) and the CfA Seyfert 1s. 90% of the objects in these samples have already been observed; the proposed observations will complete an archive in which every object in these important samples has simultaneous, long-exposure LW/SWP spectra. These objects also have completed or planned radio, infrared, optical and X-ray coverage.  This well-defined data set will allow application of powerful statistical tests which could not be applied to heterogeneous samples, since they are susceptible to unknown selection effects which can produce spurious results. This will permit several fundamental investigations, including: 1) rigorous statistical analysis of correlations such as the Baldwin effect; 2) critical tests of unified models which invoke evolution or orientation effects to produce the large range of properties observed in active galaxies; 3) model fits to the broadband continuum, to search for trends among active galaxy properties, determine emission mechanisms and construct the bolometric luminosity function; and 4) application of principal component analysis and other techniques to investigate new broadband classification systems. Finally, completing these observations will yield an AGN archive which will be essential for addressing future questions when they arise.|Y
AGMRG|Simultaneous ROSAT and IUE Observations of Quasars|Richard F.|Green|KPNO|We have been granted ROSAT time to observe 3C 263, a bright quasar in a direction of low neutral hydrogen column density. ROSAT will also observe 3C 345 and NGC 4051, which are similarly unobscured. The goal of the ROSAT observations is to study the EUV and soft-X-ray emission which accounts for much of a QSO's luminosity, but which is often absorbed by hydrogen. Simultaneous observation of these AGN with IUE would greatly extend the diagnostic powers of the ROSAT observations by allowing derivation of spectra ranging from the soft X-ray to the optical. We are arranging for simultaneous optical coverage, and propose the IUE observations here.|Y
AGMSL|UV Spectroscopy of Massive Young Stellar Populations in Interacting Galaxies|Susan A.|Lamb|Illinois|Collisions between galaxies have been implicated in the production of a wide range of energetic phenomena, including QSOs, AGN'S, and "star burst" nuclei. These phenomena can produce different, distinct ultraviolet spectra and we propose to explore this aspect of their behavior for a small sample of closely interacting and merging galaxies for which we have supporting optical, radio, and infrared observations. The emphasis of our work will be to model the massive star populations in known star burst nuclei to investigate whether stellar populations produced during galaxy collisions are measurably abnormal. Additionally, we will search for evidence in the UV spectra of co-existence of AGN and "starburst" nuclei.|Y
AGNBP|International AGN Watch: Mapping the Broad-Line Region in NGC 3783|Bradley M.|Peterson|Ohio State University|High temporal frequency monitoring of Seyfert galaxies over extended periods has proven to be an extraordinarily powerful way to unravel the structure and the physical conditions of the broad-line region (BLR) in AGNs. The photoionized BLR gas responds to the variations in the energy input rate from the continuum source with a delay determined by the light-travel time across the BLR and geometry of the region; thus, the delay provides a direct estimate of the BLR size. By measuring this delay for different lines of different ionization stages and comparing the results with photoionization model calculations, one is able to infer the run of physical conditions as a function of radial distance. The 1988 1989 monitoring campaign of NGC 5548 has yielded impressive results that demonstrate the power and viability of the reverberation mapping technique. We therefore propose to sample a different portion of the luminosity-radius plane for AGNs by observing another bright and highly variable galaxy, NGC 3783. To explore the velocity structure in more detail, we will observe NGC 3783 at higher temporal resolution during the second half of the campaign. Finally, we will examine the relationship between the UV/optical continuum variations and the variability of the X-ray spectrum by arranging contemporaneous ROSAT observations.|Y
AGNDC|IUE and GHRS Spectra of Seyfert Galaxies|D. Michael|Crenshaw|CSC - GHRS|We propose to obtain near-simultaneous IUE and GHRS (Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph) spectra of five Seyfert I galaxies. The GHRS data will consist of high resolution spectra of the UV emission lines; the IUE spectra are needed to determine the continuum fluxes, establish the continuum level beneath the emission lines, measure the broad Fe II emission, and to establish the absolute flux levels for the GHRS spectra.  The following specific objectives will be pursued: 1) The broad and narrow components of the strong emission lines will be deconvolved; this is extremely difficult to do with low-resolution IUE spectra alone.

AGNDW|Anisotropic Continuum Emission in Seyferts|D. Mark|Whittle|U Virginia|The primary aim of this program is to thoroughly examine the evidence for anisotropic continuum emission in Seyferts. Evidence for anisotropic Ionization exists for a few objects e.g. NGC1068. It is clearly Important to establish whether this Is a general property. We have chosen to work with two complete samples of Seyferts, one distance limited and the other flux limited. We have analyzed the IRAS, Einstein and IUE archive data for these samples under our 1988 ADP proposal. From this initial analysis it is now clear that one of the most important contributions to the project Is from IUE observations of Seyfert 2s. Unfortunately, because of their low UV flux, Seyfert 2s have been relatively ignored by IUE observers, leaving all archive which is quite incomplete in comparison to the other wavebands. Using the new extraction techniques, however, we find that Seyfert 2s do yield the continuum flux and slope measurements required for our program. Last year we asked for 5 shifts to observe the 5 remaining Seyfert 2 galaxies in the distance limited sample. We were awarded 3 shifts which we used to obtain good spectra of 2 galaxies. This year we are asking for a further 3 shifts to observe the remaining 3 galaxies. This will give us an unbiased distance limited sample which is COMPLETE in Seyfert 2s. Not only will this greatly enhance our study of anisotropic emission in Seyferts, but as a spin-off we are able to present the first comprehensive study of the UV properties of Seyfert 2 galaxies.|Y
AGNFC|The Ultraviolet Continuum of the Softest X-Ray-Emitting AGN|France Anne|Cordova|Penn State University|We have identified a unique sample of active galactic nuclei (AGN) with the Einstein satellite which have ultrasoft X-ray spectral components (typical blackbody temperatures are 10 eV). The existence of these objects raises several very important issues concerning the formation of optical and UV emission lines, the existence of accretion disks, and the effect of inclination on the observed continuum and emission line spectrum. We are proposing to measure the ultraviolet spectrum of a sample of these AGN using IUE. These data will be combined with near contemporaneous infrared, optical and X-ray data to determine the overall continuum shape of these objects and test whether the ultrasoft X-ray emission is an extension of a UV/optical accretion disk spectrum. The extreme nature of the X-ray spectrum in these AGN poses a severe test for models of line formation in AGN. The IUE data will provide data on UV spectral lines which are essential if we are to probe the excitation mechanisms operating in these systems, and learn how they fit in to the overall picture of AGN as a class.|Y
AGNJS|Absorption-Line Studies of Three Seyfert Galaxies|J. Michael|Shull|Colorado - CASA|We propose to continue our study of Seyfert galaxies with intrinsic absorption components, as a means of understanding their possible connection with broad absorption-line (BAL) quasars. The absorption features have been interpreted as an outflow of ionized clouds from the nuclear region or from an accretion disk affected by UV/X-ray heating. However, neither the source of the absorbing gas nor the 'gene" that distinguishes them from other Seyferts is known. We also do not understand why the absorption-line strengths exhibit both correlations and anti-correlations with the UV continuum. Only two Seyferts have previously been studied with this technique: NGC 4151 and NGC 3516. We will continue an IUE "reverberation analysis", begun in 1990, of the variable absorption lines in two Seyfert Galaxies (NGC 4051 and Mrk 279) and will begin a study of the bright, nearby Seyfert (PG 1351+64) with BAL characteristics and unusually high radio emission. Since BAL QSOs have been found exclusively in radio-quiet objects, the confirmation of PG 1351+64 as a BAL QSO is important in understanding this class of objects.|Y

We propose to investigate the accretion geometries of three AM Her binaries, AM Her itself, V795 Her and QQ Vul, by combining IUE observations with simultaneous optical spectroscopy at the 6.0 meter Special Astrophysical Observatory telescope.

AGORM|The Origin of the UV Radiation in Active Galaxies: Tests of the Reprocessing Models|Richard F.|Mushotzky|NASA/GSFC|We propose IUE observations to be coordinated with GRO and Rosat observations of four active galaxies - NGC 4151, NGC 5548, Mrk 509, and 3C 120. Our goals are to determine the broad band UV--gamma-ray energy budgets of these objects, and to study how variability in the UV, x-ray, and gamma-ray continua are related. Recent observations of simultaneous optical/UV variability in some active galaxies pose problems for conventional accretion disk models, which explained the UV continuum as thermal emission generated by viscous processes within the disk. The observations can be explained by models in which the bulk of the UV radiation is due to reprocessing of a primary gamma-ray continuum. These reprocessing models make specific predictions that can be tested. First, the total energy output in gamma-rays should be sufficient to power the UV emission. Second, changes in the gamma-ray emission should induce changes in the UV fluxes and spectra. Following the launch of GRO, it is now possible to directly test these predictions for the first time. Previous IUE observations cannot address these issues as no concurrent information concerning their gamma-ray emission was available. The proposers are a good team for this study, with AGN expertise intimate familiarity with each of the missions.|Y

AGQBP|International AGN Watch: Variability of High-Luminosity AGN Fairall 9| |Peterson|Tate University|We propose to carry out a five-month monitoring campaign on the luminous AGN Fairall 9 in order to address issues concerning short time scale variations which appear to have been undersampled in previous efforts. We will examine the high-frequency continuum variations and determine the time scale for response of the highest ionization lines, such as He II A 1640 and N v A 1240. We also suspect that the C IV and Ly-alpha response times previously reported are biased toward long lags by the poor sampling of the light curves on short time scales, and we will attempt to remeasure the emission-line lags for these lines as well, We propose to observe Fairall 9 once every four days, using one half of a US1 or VILSPA shift, for a 152-day period; this will provide an order of magnitude improvement in the sampling rate relative to previous IUE observations of this source. Twenty-four VILSPA half-shifts have already been allocated to this project, and we request 14 US1 half shifts as the US contribution to this effort.|Y
AGQCU|Intensive Multiwavelength Monitoring of PKS 2155-304|C. Megan|Urry|STScI|The proposed campaign uses the unique capabilities of the IUE to study the fundamental astrophysical problem of the origin of AGN continuum emission. Multiwavelength monitoring of the UV-bright BL Lac object PKS2155-304 in November 1991 revealed extremely rapid, correlated UV, optical, and X-ray variability, with a possible quasi-periodic time scale of ~ 0.7 days and a measurable lag between UV and Xray of ~ 2 hours, the first such detection for any AGN. This campaign did have gaps and the overlapping UV and X-ray observations lasted only ~ 3 days. We propose to improve the previous IUE monitoring by reducing gaps and extending the sampling period to 10 days, in order to: (i) investigate the stability of the UVX-ray correlation over longer time scales and better measure the lag, (ii) obtain well-sampled UV light curves long enough to study the power spectrum in the frequency interval around the suggested period, and (iii) investigate possible radio-UV correlations on short time scales. The November 1991 data strongly favor the synchrotron mechanism as the origin of the UV-X-ray continuum. If the fast UV variability is confirmed to be quasi-periodic, it is probably tied to the orbital dynamics around the putative black hole. Thus the new campaign may probe the very production of a relativistic synchrotron-emitting jet.|Y
AGQMK|IUE and Multifrequency Observations of the Quasars 3C 273 and 3C 279|M.|Kafatos|Scientific Research and Information Ass|We propose to observe the bright quasar 3C 273 using IUE as part of a large multifrequency and monitoring campaign using IUE, EUVE, ROSAT, ASCA, CGRO (OSSE, COMPTEL, and EGRET) as well as a number of ground-based observatories. Observations using the SWP/LWP cameras will be carried out over 4 half shifts during the acceptable IUE windows of early 1994 and June-July 1994 close to the observing times of the other space observatories. The third full US1 will be used to obtain a single SWP observation of 3C 279 if indications from the ground are that it is becoming brighter. Otherwise the third shift will be devoted to 3C 273 to obtain broader spectral/time coverage. Multifrequency observations are crucial in providing model constraints for quasars, particularly for sources such as blazars where contributions from both jets and accretion disks are expected. For 3C 273 UV observations spanning the IUE-EUVE range fall within an important part of the electromagnetic spectrum for SSC or accretion disk models. This may be the last opportunity for a long time to carry out multifrequency observations of an AGN.|Y
AGRDK|EGRET AGN Sources as Targets of Opportunity|Demosthenes|Kazanas|NASA/GSFC|We propose a target of opportunity program for ultraviolet IUE observations triggered by detections in the high energy gamma-ray band (E > 100 MeV) by EGRET aboard the Compton Observatory during its next year of operations. There have so far been detected by EGRET (in roughly two years of operations in the survey mode) thirty six point sources identified with extragalactic objects, all of them of the blazar AGN class. The sheer magnitude of the implied gamma-ray luminosity (~ 10E48 erg/s) and the absence of any apparent breaks in the gamma-ray spectra due to photon-photon absorption imply that the emission from these objects across the electromagnetic spectrum is relativistically beamed, a notion in agreement with arguments made prior to the discovery of the gamma-rays. The goal of the proposed program is to search for correlations in the emission between the EGRET and ME energy bands as they presumably represent radiation by the same population of relativistic electrons by two different processes (inverse Compton and synchrotron respectively) and they should be beamed by the same amount. We anticipate that these observations will place the most stringent constraints on models for blazar emission and will yield novel insights as to the origin and effects of relativistic beaming in blazars.|Y
AGRGR|Coordinated Observations of NGC 4151 and MCG-6-30-15|Gail A.|Reichert|USRA|We propose coordinated IUE, ASCA, and GRO OSSE observations of two gamma-ray bright active galaxies - NGC 4151 and MCG-6-30-15.

Second, changes in the gamma-ray emission should induce changes in the UV fluxes and spectra. Following the launch of GRO, it is now possible to directly test these predictions for the first time. Previous IUE observations (primarily from our own observing programs) are only beginning to address these issues, as little concurrent information concerning their gamma-ray emission is available.

AGRMM|International AGN Watch: Variability of the Broad-Line Radiogalaxy 3C 390.3|Matthew A.|Malkan|UCLA|We propose an intensive monitoring campaign on the strongly variable broad-line radiogalaxy 3C 390.3. We will use multiwavelength variability and reverberation mapping to compare the structure of this active nucleus with the handful of other quite different AGNs we have studied in comparable detail. 3C 390.3 has several unusual advantages: it will be the first radio-loud object studied, which is presumed to be seen at a special (nearly face-on) viewing angle; its complex emission line profile morphology suggests a particularly rich, stratified BLR structure and an unusual velocity field; it will be the second most luminous AGN monitored; and it is very likely to have large-amplitude changes in the emission lines and continuum. We are requesting NASA shifts which, combined with our ESA shifts, will allow us to observe 3C 390.3 once every six days for the entire year, for the minimum sampling we have found to be adequate for the proposed reverberation mapping.|Y

AHOMS|Ultraviolet Variations in Alpha-1 Her and Alpha-1 Sco|Myron A.|Smith|CSC - Astronomy Programs|A two-year continuation is requested of a long-term synoptic program to monitor the UV continuum and Mg II h/k emission line fluxes in the two M supergiants, alpha^1 Her and alpha^1 Sco. Ongoing radial velocity studies at the McMath telescope indicate that these stars have pulsation periods near one year as well as, in each case, a "long period" of 7-8 years. We propose to combine IUE and optical data (radial velocities, K-line, optical-continuum spectropolarimetry) to determine the cause of these irregular cycles.  Results from 1-1/2 years of monitoring Mg II h/k emission show variations consistent with each of the stars' one year periods. Their h/k variations will be compared with Ca II K-line and optical spectropolarimetry, to follow the propagation of pulsation-generated shocks through the chromosphere with the ultimate aim of building hydrodynamical models of pulsation-driven chromospheres. a Her's UV flux variations will be compared to is optical light curve which exhibits Mira-like shortperiods not seen in its radial velocity (RV) curve.|Y

ALJEO|U Cephei in its Active State|Edward C.|Olson|Illinois|U Cephei is a bright Algol system that occasionally exhibits active intervals of greatly elevated mass transfer. In the active state, transfer rates probably exceed 10-6 solar mass per year. Several investigators obtained IUE spectra of this binary prior to 1986, but none fell within such active intervals. The present collaborators obtained the first active-state spectra in mid-1986, using discretionary observing time. Unique absorption features in these few spectra have prompted us to propose this three-year target of opportunity program. IUE observations will be made only when ground-based photometry indicates pronounced activity in this binary. observing an active mass flow in U Cephei would contribute significantly toward our understanding of this crucial phase in the evolution of binary stars, which is difficult to study because of its brief duration.|Y
ALJGM|Ultraviolet Line Emitting Plasma in Algol-Type Binaries|George E.|McCluskey|Lehigh University|A number of Algol binaries display ultraviolet emission lines of various ionization stages of carbon, nitrogen, silicon, aluminum, and magnesium, among others, during the total phases of primary eclipse. Essentially, no suitable observations made with IUE exist which would permit us to determine the spatial distribution of this line emitting plasma. We propose to observe six totally eclipsing Algol-type binaries with IUE at low resolution during totality. These systems have been selected in order to provide the best opportunity to determine this distribution with a minimum of IUE observing time. Knowledge of the structure of these emitting regions is of crucial importance in successfully modelling gas flow, accretion effects, and evolution of interacting binaries.|Y

ALKGP|Time-Resolved UV Observations of Accretion Disk in Algol Binaries|Geraldine J.|Peters|USC|Time-resolved, low dispersion IUE observations of Algol systems just after second contact, throughout totality, and just before third contact are proposed to look for a UV continuum and, if found, obtain intensity profiles for their bright inner accretion disks. Such mapping can be achieved because different parts of the disk are occulted as the eclipse proceeds. The program systems will be intercompared and observations of the flux versus time will be used to produce a models of the disks. The result will be compared with new theoretical models of accretion disks for Algol binaries as well as those for cataclysmic binaries. The program stars all display long total eclipses, intermediate periods, and permanent double-peaked Ho: emission. The primary target is AD Her, while secondary targets include VW Cyg, and SW Cyg. The H-alpha disks in these systems have already been mapped from CCD data and image tube plates obtained at KPNO.|Y
ALMMP|UX Monocerotis: A Transition Between the Algols and the Serpentids?|Mirek J.|Plavec|UCLA|I propose to complete the observations of the strongly interacting eclipsing binary system UX Monocerotis (HD 65607). This binary seems to be a system intermediate between the relatively quiescent Algol systems and the strongly interacting W Serpentis binaries. The former easily reveal the nature of the component stars, but the rate of mass transfer is too low to yield much information on the accretion disks and outflowing plasmas. In the latter systems, the disks are too thick and prevent us from identifying the component stars and thus determining their masses and evolutionary status.  UX Monocerotis appears to be a fortunate compromise: The light curve is asymmetrical and variable from cycle to cycle, yet the component stars are both distinguishable. It also displays beautiful and fairly strong "superionized" emission lines. In the Algols, these are visible only during the brief total eclipse: in the Serpentids, they are visible at all phases. Again, UX Mon is an intermediate case, showing the emissions over a broader phase interval.  It is most likely that the observed photometric and spectroscopic variability is due to the presence of an accretion disk of an intermediate and variable thickness. It is also possible that the hotter star is pulsating. All this can be decided in a coordinated campaign with Drs. E.C. Olson and P.B. Etzel doing 5color photometry, J. Andersen measuring radial velocity, and me taking IUE spectra and high-resolution CCD optical spectrograms. A fairly dense coverage of just one or a few orbital cycles is very essential.|Y
ALOJE|TT Hydrae: Accretion Disks and Winds in Algol Binaries|Joel A.|Eaton|Tennessee State University|TT Hya (B9.5 V+KO III-IV) is a bright, totally eclipsing Algol binary with absorptions of a warm extended accretion disk in its ultraviolet spectrum. In addition, during total eclipse it shows an emission-line spectrum at low dispersion characteristic of a wide range of interacting binaries. To better understand accretion processes in binary systems, we need a high-dispersion spectrum in total eclipse to determine the source of the line radiation. This spectrum will allow us (1) to study the kinematics of the line-scattering regions, so as to distinguish between contributions of the disk and of a wind, (2) to search for a contribution to the line emission from the cool binary component's chromosphere and transition region, and (3) to define the true strengths and profiles of disk absorption lines so that they may be analyzed reliably.|Y
ALPRK|Mapping the Accretion Flow in Algol-Type Binaries|Ronald H.|Kaitchuck|Ball State University|Short-period Algol binaries have accretion disks that are produced by the impact of the mass-transfer stream with the primary star. These disks are known to be highly variable and show evidence of extreme turbulence. This study will investigate the disk structure as seen during total eclipse, map the accretion flow around the primary star and investigate an emission site that is located on or near the primary star and along a line connecting the stellar centers.|Y
ALPRP|A Quantitative Study of S Cancri: An Algol Binary at the Terminal State of Mass Transfer|Ronald S.|Polidan|NASA/GSFC|The Algol binary S Cnc is a 9.5 day totally eclipsing system with a very low mass (0.23M(sun)) K0III-IV secondary star. The system has an extensive archive of optical data, the analysis of which argues that this system has ceased mass transfer and that the secondary is now detached from its critical Roche lobe and has an "extended atmosphere" between its photosphere and Roche lobe. Existing low S/N IUE eclipse spectra show strong emission in C IV, Si IV, Mg II and other lines. The derived luminosities in these UV lines are an order of magnitude greater than the luminosities for the most chromospherically active single or binary stars. We propose to use low and high resolution IUE spectra to investigate S Cnc in order to derive a better understanding of the origins of the UV emission lines seen during eclipse and to define the geometrical properties and physical conditions in the gas giving rise to the extended atmosphere detected near eclipse in optical spectra. These new data will advance our understanding of the mass-transfer process in the late stages of close binary-star evolution and provide the first measures of the level of chromospheric activity in the low mass, Roche-lobe-filling secondary in this system.|Y
ALQGP|Mass Transfer and Loss in Algol Binaries with Short Periods and Early B-Type Primaries|Geraldine|Peters|University of Southern California|IUE observations are proposed of the Algol binaries Z Vul (B3V + A2III, P=2.46 days) and FV Sco (B3V + A2III:, P=5.73 days) over one cycle in their orbits to investigate the effect of the cross-section and temperature of the primary on the mass transfer and mass loss in the system. Both systems contain early B primaries (probably with weak winds) that present a large enough cross-section to impede the flow of the gas stream. According to theoretical expectations, the gas stream in these systems should be narrow, highly focused, and will strike the primary instead of feeding an accretion disk. The lack of H-alpha emission in these systems supports this suggestion. I will look for evidence of a hot spot at the predicted site of gas stream impact and a high temperature plasma on the trailing side of the binary and between the stars that may be generated from the gas stream collision and/or subsequent splash. One archival IUE image of FV Sco has indeed revealed the presence of a 10^6 K plasma at phase 0.76, which may generated by a splash. The circumstellar material in Z Vul and FV Sco will be compared with that in AU Mon and CX Dra, systems also with early B primaries but larger separations. Any mass loss at phase 0.5 or elsewhere will be compared with the inferred rate of mass transfer and with that observed in AU Mon and other systems. Finally I will look for evidence of carbon depletion in these systems as we have found in other Algols with A-F secondaries.|Y
ALRJE|Rapid Rotation and the Variable Wind of Al Velorum|Joel A.|Eaton|Tennessee State University - CEIS|Eclipses of a hot star by the outer atmosphere of a cool star make it possible to determine physical conditions in chromospheres of cool stars in ways impossible from analyzing emission spectra. Existing high-dispersion spectra from two eclipses show that the chromosphere and wind of AL Vel (K0 II + B8) vary in mass by ~ two orders of magnitude, far more than in any other zeta Aur binary, and this variation probably results from the star's rapid rotation. I am proposing more complete observations of one more eclipse to assess the effect of rapid rotation on cool bright giants. Specifically, these observations will (1) determine better just how variable is the chromosphere of a rapidly rotating star and just how much physical properties of chromospheric gas change with massloss rate, (2) determine how continuous are the wind and chromosphere, and (3) measure the rotation of the chromosphere and the dynamical effects of the second star on the wind.|Y

AMBJL|Ultraviolet Spectroscopy of Metallic-Line Stars|John B.|Lester|Denver|We have in progress a major program to reanalyze the atmospheric properties and abundances of a selected group of well-known sharp-lined Am stars. Kitt Peak has already allocated 25 nights to this project. We are requesting observing time on the I.U.E. satellite to extend our spectral coverage into the ultraviolet. These ultraviolet observations will enable us to make the following advances: (a) Very substantially improve our knowledge of the carbon, nitrogen and oxygen abundances in Am stars. (b) Provide abundance data for elements for which there is little or no information in the visual spectral region. (c) Enable us to compare the line profiles for the Ca II H and K lines with the Mg II h and k lines. (d) Make a detailed analysis of the ultraviolet spectrum to see if there are other clues to the nature of the Am phenomenon.|Y
AMEJL|The Energy Distributions of AM Stars in Open Clusters|John B.|Lester|Toronto-Erndl|We have begun a program to systematically analyze the atmospheric properties and abundances of Ain stars in open clusters. We are making spectroscopic observations of these stars with the 1.88-m telescope at the David Dunlap Observatory, and we have applied to Kitt Peak for time to measure the visible energy distributions. This application requests time to measure the energy distributions of our program stars in the 2000 - 3000 A region. Our previous work on Am stars has shown that the ultraviolet energy distributions are very important in determining the atmospheric parameters of the stars. Having found the atmospheres which best match the stars, we will then analyze our spectroscopic data to quantitatively determine the elemental abundances. Because the open clusters have well-established ages, we will then be able to study quantitatively the characteristics of the Am phenomenon as a function of stellar age. This will provide a powerful test of the current model for this peculiarity.|Y
AMKEB|Long Term Variations of AM Stars|Erika|Bohm-Vitense|Washington|We would like to reobserve some selected Am stars which we originally observed in 1979 and 1980 in order to study long term time variations in the UV. Such variations have been observed earlier to occur in the optical spectral region for some of them (15 Vul, tau UMa) If temperature changes are responsible for the optical variations than larger variations in the energy distribution are expected in the ultraviolet.  Our original observations were proposed because we wanted to study such variations. We would now like 10 reobserve some of the stars observed earlier in order to check whether any changes in the uv energy distribution or in the details of the spectra have occurred during the time span of 6-8 years. If we do not make the observations now we mail never get a chance to actually do the investigation which we set out to do 10 years ago.|Y
AMKJH|Coordinated IUE/Voyager Observations of AM Herculis|Jay B.|Holberg|Arizona|We propose to obtain IUE observations of the magnetic cataclysmic variable AM Her in its "high" state. These observations are intended as part of a coordinated program of simultaneous observations of this system with Voyager in the 500 to 1200 A range together with opticallinfrared photometry and spectropolarimetry. The primary scientific objectives of our proposal are: 1) To critically test model predictions for the energy distribution of the reprocessed soft X-ray "blackbody" component, 2) To determine the existence of the short wavelength "upturn" seen in some SWP spectra and any possible relation it may have to the soft X-ray blackbody component, and 3) To determine the apparent luminosity of the AM Her "high" state by incorporating nearlysimultaneous observations from 500 A to the visible.|Y
AOOAD|Study of the Atmosphere of Alpha Orionis|Andrea K.|Dupree|Harvard CFA - SAO|Our discovery of a 420-day periodic variation in the radiations from Alpha Orionis (Betelgeuse) was made possible by dedicated frequent observations with the IUE satellite in conjunction with contemporaneous ground-based photometric and spectroscopic observations. Periodic photospheric pulsations are the most likely explanation of the photometric variations, and this IUE result has recently been confirmed by measured velocity variations in the photosphere. Identification of pulsations in the atmosphere of Alpha Ori is important for they appear to be the fundamental pulsation mode of the star, and can provide the long-sought mechanism to heat and to extend the atmosphere of the star, and help to initiate the mass flow from the supergiant.  Our monitoring program has demonstrated that the longer 5.8 year period of variability identified in the 1930's has disappeared, and a period of ~10.2 years has developed. We propose to continue the multifrequency monitoring of Alpha Ori for the next three years to determine the long period of variability, to establish the phase delay between chromospheric and photospheric modulation, and to evaluate the stability of the 420-day period.  These obsservations represent a unique use of IUE since they provide continuous time line, enabling long-term periodicities to be discovered and allowing study of the response of a supergiant atmosphere and circumstellar shell to photospheric pulsations.|Y

APBKR|Spectroscopy of Three Peculiar AP Stars at Ultraviolet Wavelengths|Karl D.|Rakos|Vienna|It is proposed to observe three Ap stars, HD 124224, HO 78316 and HD 129174 HD 124224 is a well known He variable with a period of 12 hours. The star should be observed during one single shift as often as possible to obtain the but it has strong lines of Si. The spectrum of HD 78316 should be compared with the Hg-Mn star HD 129174. The previous observations of Alpha And - also a manganese star - show variations in spectral lines and mass-loss. The spectra of HD 78316 and HD 129174 should be used to investigate a possible mass-loss.|Y
APBSA|Spectrum Variability of Hot Peculiar A Stars|Saul J.|Adelman|The Citadel|Comparison of optical region spectrophotometry of magnetic Ap and normal stars has revealed differences in the shapes of their flux distributions such as would be expected from different opacities. Study of the ultraviolet where Ap stars radiate most of their energy should lead to a better understanding of how flux is redistributed from the ultraviolet into the optical region. Identification of the features in the Ap stars and comparison with normal main sequence stars should permit the identification of the additional sources of opacity. When one studies a spectrum variable, the rotation of the star permits one to sample effectively different atmospheres at different phases. This work should lead to an improved understanding of the detailed atmospheric structure and of the distribution of the chemical composition and Ap stellar atmospheres over the surfaces of two or three well established spectrum and photometric variables.|Y
APDRP|UV Variability of AP Stars|Robert J.|Panek|CSC|Broadband UV photometry has revealed the remarkable UV photometric variability of the Ap stars, in opposition to the small, periodic optical variability. It is generally accepted that this variability occurs because of flux redistribution forced by strong UV-line absorption. However, there has been very little photometric study of the UV variations with a spectral resolution high enough to reveal the mechanisms by which the flux redistribution occurs. The IUE is well suited for this type of detailed, in-depth study. We propose to obtain spectrophotometry thoughout the cycle of variation of several Ap stars. Low dispersion spectra will be obtained to establish the photometric variations, while occasional high dispersion spectra will permit the interpretation of line blends and continuum windows observed at low dispersion. The data will also permit a more extensive search for possible new phenomena, arising from stellar distortions and secular variability.|Y
APEWW|Unstable Elements in Normal & Peculiar Stars of A-Type|Werner W.|Weiss|Vienna|The unstable elements Technecium, Promethium, Americium, Uranium and Thorium shall be identified in chemically peculiar stars and compared with results in the visible spectral region. Due to the short decay time of Pm, Am and Tc, severe constraints for the mechanism producing these elements in situ will result, if they can be identified beyond doubt. Since the abundance of these instable elements seems to be very low, it is important to observe the resonance lines which are in the UV.  For comparison and as a cross-check, a set of chemically normal stars also has to be observed.|Y
APFRP|Variability of the AP SI Stars|Robert J.|Panek|CSC|Our goal is to understand the mechanism which produces the photometric variability in the silicon-rich class of peculiar A-type stars. Our study of 56 Arietis has demonstrated that the IUE low resolution trailed spectra can define accurate narrow-band light curves which detail the spectral signatures of the flux redistribution operating in these stars. In particular, our results appear to confirm the important role of Si II autoionization lines, and we have discovered a sharp edge in the unexplored region below 1400 A which we identify with bound-free Si II absorption. However, the complex evolution of the light curves from 2000-3000 A clearly shows that other elements must also be important. UV data for further investigation of this phenomenon do not exist. We propose to confirm our conclusions on the important role of Si II in these stars by observing another representative Ap Si star, HD 40312. In addition, we propose to investigate the role of elements other than silicon by observing two extreme members of the class, HD 187437 and HD 215441. These should have a very large amplitude in the 2000-3000A range, revealing the flux redistribution mechanisms there which are not distinguished in 56 Arietis. The Zeeman magnetic field of HD 215441 is an order of magnitude greater than the median for these stars. We will derive bolometric light curves to search for non-constancy of the effective temperature, as might be caused by distortion of the shape of the star by the magnetic field.|Y
APHGS|Phase-Resolved Spectroscopy of the Ap Si Star 56 Arietis|George|Sonneborn|CSC|The peculiar A-type star 56 Arietis is noted for its pronounced photometric and spectroscopic variability. The major spectroscopic peculiarity is the great strength of the lines of silicon. All variability is periodic with P=0.728 days and is stable on a time-scale of decades. Panek and Sonneborn (1984) have derived detailed light curves for 56 Ari from 1150 to 8000 A using IUE low dispersion spectra and optical data from the literature. The photometric variation above and below 1600 A is roughly anti-phased. The new UV spectrophotometry confirms earlier suspicions (e.g. Leckrone 1975) that the variation of the strong UV features of Si II drives the photometric variability of 56 Ari, and presumably other Ap Si stars as well, through the action of flux redistribution. However, the light curves at the various wavelengths show remarkable differences in exact phase and shape which indicate that the mechanism of flux redistribution is complex.  A quantitative spectroscopic study is needed to clearly define the phasedependence of the UV lines which drive the variations in 56 Ari. We propose to analyze existing SWP high-dispersion images of 56 Ari to provide phase-resolved spectroscopy of an Ap Si star. 56 Ari is particularly well-suited to such a study; the IUE archives contains 18 SWP high-dispersion images providing complete phase coverage. Our low-dispersion spectra will be used to define the continuum for the analysis of individual line profiles. 56 Ari shows no abundance anomaly in the iron-peak or rare-earth elements, as do many Ap stars.|Y
APIJH|Ultraviolet Variations of Cool AP Stars with Strong Magnetic Fields|Jules P.|Halpern|Columbia|A recent model atmosphere analysis of 21 Com (A3SrCrEu) suggests that changes in temperature over the surface of the star are required, in addition to the expected changes in chemical composition, to account for the observed ultraviolet variations. A correlation is found between the abundance of iron and the temperature; iron-rich regions are hotter than the surroundings. We theorize that this peculiar temperature distribution could be due to a heating effect of the magnetic field. We propose to obtain phase resolved spectra of 2 cool Ap stars for which the variations of the magnetic field are known, 78 Vir and 53 Cam. This will permit the search for a correlation between temperature variations and magnetic field over a rotation period.|Y

APMSR|Elemental Abundances of the HGMN Stars MU Leporis and Upsilon Herculis|Scott W.|Roby|Suny - Oswego|Recently, Roby and Lambert (RL, 1990) did a large survey of N (and C and 0) abundances in the Am, HgMn, and magnetic Ap classes of chemically peculiar stars using high excitation, near-IR lines. Additional N I abundances using low excitation, UV lines in co-added IUE spectra have been determined by Roby, Leckrone, and Adelman (RLA, 1990) in 4 superficially normal stars and 2 HgMn stars. These studies show that N is strongly deficient in the HgMn stars relative to the "normal" stars of similar temperature and that the intrinsically stronger N I UV lines provide a more accurate measure of this N deficiency (the weaker near-IR lines are often not detected).  We propose to expand the sample of HgMn stars with high quality UV abundances. We have chosen Mu Leporis and Upsilon Herculis because these stars are bright, sharplined, and are not spectroscopic binaries. In addition, the N I near-IR lines are absent (RL) in these stars indicating N abundances at least 10 times below solar. High quality co-added IUE spectra will permit a more accurate determination of the N deficiency in these stars. The large deficiency of N is especially interesting in that simple diffusion predictions (RL) for HgMn stars suggest the N is being depleted by upward diffusion out of the photosphere. Additional observations may allow further constraints on this interpretation.  While the primary emphasis of this project is on N abundances, we will also be determining abundances for other important elements, especially those of the Fe-peak. Comparison of the UV abundances for these elements with those previously derived from the higher excitation lines in the visible and near-IR portions of the spectrum (RL, 1990 and Adelman, 1989, 1990) will permit various checks on NLTE effects and the atmospheric parameters and ultimately lead to better understanding of the surface abundances and physics of these stars.|Y
APMTK|Rapid Spectrophotometric UV Variations of 21 Com, Unique Among AP Stars|Tobias J.|Kreidl|Lowell Observatory|Previous observations of the Ap star 21 Com with IUE show complex UV variabilities shortwards of 1750A. The far UV distribution shows large amplitude variations around 1500A clearly related to the rotation. Consecutive high-resolution SWP spectra show line variations of moderate amplitudes on time scales of 30 minutes to 2 hours. In addition, an instance of dramatic line variations occurred in November 1979: three spectra displayed deep, broad absorption lines which came and went in 80 minutes or less. The line variabilities altogether constitute a first detection of rapid line variations in the far UV spectrum of an Ap star.  Recent multi-site photometry of 21 Com leads to a confident value of the rotation period of the star of 2.00435 days. A set of consecutive IUE spectra are needed to achieve a complete phase coverage of the star, all obtained at one time. We propose to take high-resolution SWP spectra separated by 30 minutes, covering all phases of the rotation period. The new data will be used to study the flux variation over the 2-day rotation period, determine the period of the short time scale spectral variations, look for other instances of outstanding variations and address the nature of the variability of 21 Con?|Y

Recently, in order to extend the UV observations to younger stars in nearby clusters, I have obtained low resolution Mg II spectra for a number of K dwarfs in the Alpha Persei and Pleiades clusters, both of which have nuclear ages under 100 Myr. At a given spectral type, the cluster stars show an order of magnitude spread in their chromospheric emission. The emission is directly correlated with the stellar rotation rate, being strongest for a group of rapid rotators having periods < 1 day and weakest for more slowly rotating cluster members. If the rapid rotators are the most recent stars to arrive on the main sequence, then the observations suggest that the evolution of chromospheric activity with age may not follow any simple square-root or exponential decay law.  Recently, Stauffer et al. have identified additional members of the Alpha Persei cluster with rapid rotation rates. I am proposing here to obtain low resolution Mg II spectra for six of their stars in order to improve the UV statistics for this cluster. To date only four rapid rotators in the cluster have been observed with IUE, and so the proposed observations will more than double the number of useful Mg II spectra. These observations are needed to confirm the idea that very young, low mass stars undergo a surge in activity (and rotation) when they first evolve onto the main sequence and then experience a sudden spin down and loss of activity soon thereafter. Understanding the rotational history and the evolution of chromospheric activity of such young stars is one of the most important problems facing stellar astrophysics today, to which IUE can make a unique contribution.|Y
APOEB|Lyman Alpha Emission as a Diagnostic of Atmospheric Pulsations|Edward W.|Brugel|Colorado - CASA|Mira variables can be utilized to test a wide variety of stellar astrophysical effects. For such studies, the behavior of the Lyman-alpha line alone provides a unique opportunity to place empirical constraints on the physical models of several important aspects of the physics of this class of stars: (1) the mass loss mechanism(s), and the role that Lyman-alpha plays in coupling the radiation field to the mass loss via radiation pressure; (2) radiative transfer effects of an optically thick line in a multiply shocked atmosphere - a topic which has applicability in fields as remote as extragalactic studies; and (3) constraining theoretical models of the evolution of the shock in these of pulsationally unstable stellar atmospheres (which also has a direct bearing on the mass loss).  To date, previous IUE programs to study the atmospheres of Miras have been restricted to the LWP camera and focused on studies of the Mg II and Fe II lines that are present at various phases of the shock cycle. The MgII lines in particular possess a number of unusual observational properties that appear to be common among Miras, most notably, the emission centroids are shifted relative to the stellar radial velocity far in excess of the presumed wind or shock velocity. We have interpreted this effect as multiple scatterings across the shock front, in a manner analogous to Fermi acceleration of particles across a shock front.  Of equal or greater importance - both energetically and as an atmospheric diagnostic - is the Lyman-alpha line at 1215A. As we note above, the Lyman-alpha line provides an excellent opportunity to study a variety of physics in Mira atmospheres. We propose to observe the unique object S Car, whose high radial velocity (~ 280 km/sec) provides us with the only opportunity to study the Lyman-alpha emission from a Mira that is essentially uncontaminated and unobstructed by the interstellar medium. These observations will also provide additional observational inputs to the newly emerging class of theoretical radiative transfer problems of resonance line transfer (including partial redistribution) across shock fronts.|Y

ARIJL|Lyman Alpha Profiles of HR 1099 and AR Lac|Jeffrey L.|Linsky|Colorado - JILA|We propose to acquire high-resolution spectra of the Lyman-alpha line of the short-period eclipsing binary RS CVn system AR Lacertae. The velocity difference between opposite quadratures (about 330 km s^-1 will cause a wavelength shift in the stellar profiles of about 1.5 R, while the position of the interstellar absorption remains constant. In this way, we will be able to recover that portion of the intrinsic stellar Lyman-alpha profile that is generally obscurred by interstellar absorption and thereby determine the intrinsic profiles of both components of AR Lac. Once we know the intrinsic shape of the profile, we will be able to correct SWP-LO spectra that are not saturated at Lyman-alpha for the geocoronal and interstellar contributions so that we can determine the surface flux of Lyman-alpha. We will to obtain additional short lowresolution exposures that will allow us to test and calibrate our techniques for performing these corrections. We will incorporate the surface flux measurements into the multi-component models we are constructing for these stars. We expect that discrete plage emission components seen on the Mg II k lines will also be visible on the Lyman-alpha profile. If so, we will be able to obtain the Lyman-alpha surface flux in the plage region alone. HR 1099 is less active and exhibits less of an orbital velocity "swing" than AR Lac. However, the hydrogen column density is very low along that line of sight, so less of the intrinsic profile is obscured. We will attempt to determine the intrinsic Lyman-alpha profile of HR 1099 using spectra available in the IUE archives.|Y
ARNJN|Fifth Epoch Doppler Imaging Observations of AR Lacertae|James E.|Neff|NASA/GSFC|We undertook Mg II k Doppler imaging observations of the eclipsing RS CVn system AR Lacertae in 1983, 1985, 1987, and 1989. These observations have revealed (1) the presence of distinct bright regions (plages) on the K star, (2) cyclic variations in the global Mg II k surface flux and line width from both stars, (3) a dark hemisphere on the G star, (4) flaring regions on both stars, possible Mg II k emission from the center of mass of the system, and (5) long-term changes in the structure of the lower chromospheres of the stars. We propose here to continue our biennial monitoring. Our goal is to study the evolution of the structure of the lower chromospheres of both stars. These proposed observations will extend our baseline to eight years, permitting us to track the plage migration and to better determine their lifetimes.|Y
ARQFW|Sixth Epoch Doppler Images of AR Lacertae: The Return of the Plages|M.|Walter|Stony Brook|We undertook Mg II k Doppler imaging observations of the eclipsing RS CVn system AR Lacertae in 1983, 1985, 1987, 1989, 1990, and 1991. These observations have revealed (1) the presence of distinct bright regions (plages) on the K star, (2) cyclic variations in the global Mg II k surface flux and line width from both stars,  (3) flaring regions on both stars, (4) possible Mg II k emission from the center-of-mass of the system, and (5) long-term changes in the structure of the lower chromospheres of the stars. Most surprising, the visibility of the plages has decreased over time. We propose here to complete the approximately biennial monitoring of this system. Our goal is to study the evolution of the structure of the lower chromospheres of both stars. These proposed observations will extend our baseline to eleven years, permitting us to track the chromospheric structure and plage migration on a timescale comparable to that of the activity cycles in late-type stars. If the activity cycle in AR Lac is of order 10 to 20 years, we expect the chromospheric plages to reappear at this epoch.|Y
ASNFB|Magellanic A Supergiants and the Effects of Metallicity on UV Fluxes and Mass Loss|Frederick C.|Bruhweiler|Catholic University|Even though A supergiants are some of the visually brightest stars in the Magellanic Clouds as well as bright in the UV, few IUE spectra exist. Only one low resolution spectrum of an SMC A supergiant exists and there are no high dispersion spectra of any bonafide normal A supergiants in either the LMC or the SMC. We propose a dual study using new high and low resolution observations combined with archival data.  a.) We will obtain high dispersion LWP spectra of four bright A0 supergiants in the Magellanic Clouds to study how mass loss varies with metallicity in the SMC, the LMC, and the Milky Way. In particular, we will investigate if the wind terminal velocity and mass loss rate decrease with metallicity and luminosity, as suggested from some studies of O and B stars.  b.) We will use SWP and LWP low dispersion data of early A supergiants to determine how the UV continua and prominent stellar features vary with metallicity and spectral type. We will explore whether the UV continua can be used as a metallicity index. If this proves feasible, it will affect future UV extragalactic studies using these luminous stars to probe other more distant galaxies.|Y
ASPCA|A Study of the UV Interstellar Absorption Along Sight Lines Sampled by the Wisconsin Ultraviolet Photo Polimeter Expermi|Christopher|Anderson|Washburn Observatory|During the 1990 December flight of Astro-1 the Wisconsin Ultraviolet Photo Polarimeter Experiment (WUPPE) observed six stars specifically chosen to sample the interstellar polarization. It was found that there is considerable variation in the wavelength dependence of the interstellar polarization along these sight lines (Clayton et al. 1992). For three of the objects the polarization was well described by an extrapolation of the Serkowski law from the visible and IR. Two of the targets had polarization in excess of the Serkowski extrapolation and one showed a distinct polarization enhancement at the 2175 A extinction bump. The three polarization behaviours, Serkowski-like , super-Serkowski and polarization bump feature are represented in the three northern hemisphere stars HD37903, HD25443 and HD197770 respectively. We have initiated an extensive survey of the interstellar environments of these sight lines which will ultimately include both archival and new observations spanning the entire available electromagnetic spectrum. IUE high resolution observations exist for only HD37903. We propose to obtain both LWP and SWP exposures of these two objects in order to aid in establishing the characteristics of the interstellar medium along these sight lines .|Y
ASPSS|New IUE Observations of Unique Asteroids & Asteroid Surface Calibration Targets|S. Alan|Stern|Southwest Research Institute|We propose that IUE expand the first-order reconnaissance of non-icy planetary surface properties in the mid-ultraviolet by obtaining the UV spectra of (i) a set of asteroids visited by spacecraft, (ii) well characterized lunar surfaces, and (iii) a pair of objects making unique apparitions in 1993-1994. None of the proposed targets (including the lunar terrains, as we describe below) have been studied by IUE or HST.  The proposed IUE observations are designed to provide both an important framework to "calibrate" the UV taxonomy of non-icy solar system surfaces, and useful observations to complement spacecraft flybys of asteroids, and new insights into unique objects. In the process of obtaining this dataset, we will achieve the first spectra Near Earth Asteroids (NEA) below 2500 A, obtain the first spectrum of an NEA comet nucleus candidate, and expand our database of rotationally resolved spectra from 2 objects to 5 by including the first C- and M-types, and an S-type 3x brighter than 4179 Toutatis (a target in Episode 15).  We will analyze the proposed spectra to expand the database of UV-characterized asteroids, to place new constraints on the composition and reflectance of these bodies, and to make comparisons of their UV spectral properties to other planetary satellites and asteroids previously studied by IUE.  Several of the observations we are proposing are time critical because particular observation geometries argue they be performed in the 1993-1994 window.|Y
ASPTS|What are the Colors of A Stars?|Theodore|Simon|U Hawaii|IUE spectra we have obtained for normal A stars show there is a large range in the ultraviolet colors of these stars. At 1900 A the scatter amounts to nearly 0.5 mags at a given B - V color index. We can eliminate interstellar or circumstellar reddening as the cause of this dispersion. We can also make a convincing case against individual differences in heavy metal abundance and UV line blanketing. The scatter is NOT instrumental. At present its origin is unknown. In this proposal we are asking for IUE observing time so that we can enlarge the number of mid A-type stars sampled and so we can extend the survey to slightly earlier and slightly later spectral types along the main sequence. This will provide us with much better statistics on the distribution of UV colors of A stars, and furnish a comparison with stars in adjacent spectral classes. This proposed survey is important because Bohm-Vitense has suggested that stellar energy distributions might be expected to change in the domain of the middle A-type stars due to the sudden onset of convection. She claims that there are two distinct sequences of A stars as a function of B V color, one convective and one purely radiative. These effects, if they exist, can be searched for using UV spectra. A major goal of this program is to carry out a definitive test of Bohm-Vitense's suggestion.|Y
ASRKB|IUE Observations of Hot Stars Coordinated with Astro-2|Karen S.|Bjorkman|U Wisconsin|The Wisconsin Ultraviolet Photo-Polarimeter Experiment on Astro-2 will obtain UV spectropolarimetry of hot stars over the 1400-3200 A bandpass with a resolution of 6 A. UV spectropolarimetry is a powerful tool for elucidating the geometry of circumstellar dust, the nature of the particles responsible for interstellar extinction, and the geometry and radial structure of hot star winds and gas disks, provided that the nature of the UV polarized spectrum can be related to spectral features in the UV data. The lUE high dispersion mode with a resolution of 25 km/s provides a powerful complement to WUPPE data and has been instrumental in establishing 2 B[e] stars as PMS proto-planetary disk systems. HUT co-observations are planned for all of the WUPPE targets. Based on the success of coordinated Astro-1 and lUE observations, we are requesting similar coverage for WUPPE observations of hot stars during Astro-2. |Y

AUOKC|Simultaneous IUE/HST-GHRS Observations of AU MIC|Kenneth G.|Carpenter|NASA/GSFC|We propose to monitor the early dwarf-M flare star and BY Dra variable AU Mic over two IUE shifts approximately centered on the time of HST observations with the GHRS. The GHRS observations are part of a Cycle 1 HST GO program that is to be reexecuted in late summer of 1992, due to an intermittent HST instrument failure during the initial execution of the HST program in September 1991. The GHRS observations cover a single, very narrow range of wavelengths (36 A) containing Lyman-alpha, Si III 1206 A, and O V 1218 A. They will be obtained at very high time resolution (0.4 sec/integration) and are designed to look for evidence of proton downflow during the impulsive phase of a flare. We request simultaneous IUE observations to place the HST observations in a broader context, which will include a wider variety of chromospheric and transition region lines and their behavior over a 16 hour period approximately centered on the time of the GHRS observations. IUE data is critically needed during flare detections by HST, so that the radiative losses in the UV can be estimated and compared to the energy carried in the proton downflow, in order to evaluate the importance of this energy source to the flare.|Y
AUQGP|Variations in AU Mon in the Early Stages of Its Periodic Mass Transfer Cycle|Geraldine J.|Peters|University of Southern California|Phase-resolved observations of the Algol binary AU Mon (B5Ve+F8III:) are proposed near phase 0.25 of its long-term (411d) light cycle to establish the mass transfer rate, determine the density/geometrical extent of the accretion disk and high temperature plasma, obtain the systemic mass loss rate, and confirm a scenario for its cyclic activity suggested by previous data. IUE observations from 1988-91 reveal that the optical light variations (0.3 mag) are accompanied by an oscillation in its mass transfer rate, which may be due to pulsation of the secondary (M-dot is largest and the vertically extended region of the accretion disk densest when the star is faint), and are partly caused by the appearance of an additional "lukewarm" (12,000 K) plasma that appears after the mass transfer rate declines. Constraints on the spacecraft betaangle have thus far prevented observations between phases 0.0-0.4 during which the lukewarm plasma fades and the mass transfer rate again increases. Thus to complete the existing dataset, observations at four lines-of-sight in the orbit near phase ~0.25 are requested to study the response of the accretion disk and mass loss to the onset of mass transfer. Combining the new results with previous data, the integrated mass and loss over the light cycle will be estimated.|Y
AURGP|The Inner Accretion Disk in AU Mon Following Enhanced Mass Transfer|Geraldine J.|Peters|USC|AU Mon (HD 50846, B5Ve+F-G:, P=11.11 days) is an Algol type binary system that displays permanent double-peaked H-alpha emission, a hot (100,000 K) plasma on its trailing hemisphere, and an interesting periodic long-term (411-day) intrinsic variation of 0.3 mag in its optical light (Lorenzi 1985). IUE observations from 1988-94 have revealed that these light variations are accompanied by an oscillation in its mass transfer rate, which may be due to pulsation of the secondary (dM/dt is largest and the vertically extended region of the accretion disk densest when the star is faint), and are partly caused by the appearance of an additional "lukewarm" (12,000 K) plasma that appears after the mass transfer rate declines. To locate this additional plasma, investigate its physical properties, and confirm whether it is the remnant of the star's previous episode of enhanced mass transfer, I propose a series of low dispersion (SWP+LWP) continuum observations during an eclipse when the star is bright. These observations will be supported by high dispersion SWP observations near phase 0.9 (looking through the gas stream), 0.04 (just before the end of egress), 0.25 (quiet phase), and 0.50 (looking through mass loss region near L3) to estimate the rate of mass transfer and loss and determine the location of any hot plasma that may be present as a result of an impact of the gas stream onto the star or inner accretion disk.|Y

AVHEB|Periodic Light Variations of Alpha-Squared CVN|Erika|Bohm-Vitense|Washington|Visual observations of the Ap star alpha^2 CVn show a steeper energy distribution during minimum light than at maximum. A steeper energy distribution means a higher temperature. The star must therefore show a region of higher temperature during minimum light, which is possible only if we see a smaller area at this phase than during maximum light. We have made model calculations for the light variations of a nonspherically symmetric star, which shows qualitative agreement with the observations in the uv and in the visual. We would like to check and improve our model calculations by detailed comparison with high and low resolution IUE spectra which will supplement existing optical spectra.  We want to supplement existing IUE spectra to get complete phase coverage.|Y

AXPJS|IUE Observations of an X-ray Anomalous A-Type Giant|Javad|Siah|Villanova University|Einstein IPC and ROSAT PSPC observations show that the A-type giant is an X-ray source with f(X) ~ 3 x 10^-13 ergs/s/cm^2. Since X-ray emission is generally not observed from Atype giants, the discovery of X-ray emission from HD229041 could suggest that the star has an unusually active chromosphere. Alternatively, HD 229041 may be a binary, in which case the X-rays could arise from the companion. Recent UBV photometry shows the star to be a low amplitude variable but is not sufficient to determine binarity. We request IUE observations to look for evidence of anomalous chromospheric emission or for evidence of continuum or line emission which may indicate the presence of a companion.|Y

BBOJB|Beryllium and Boron Abundances in Population II Stars|Jerry T.|Bonnell|CSC - RDAF|We propose an attempt to use IUE to detect the light elements Beryllium (Be) and Boron (B) in an extremely metal poor giant star. Only upper limits of B (2500A) have been previously derived using IUE data for population II stars and no attempt, as far as we are aware, has been made using IUE data to detect Be (3130A). For this proposal we have carefully selected a target, bright enough to be observed in the highdispersion mode of the LWP camera. This star, HD 52961, is substantially more metal deficient than those used in previous studies, consequently, uncertainties caused by blending with UV Fe lines and other metal lines in previous investigations will be reduced. In addition, we plan to adopt an observational and data reduction strategy which will increase the S/N of the data and reduce uncertainties due to camera artifacts. Further improvements over previous determinations will be afforded by the use of improved atomic data in the abundance analysis.|Y
BBORE|Broadband Microvariability in OJ 287 and MKN 421|Richard A.|Edelson|NASA/GSFC|The origin of the hot chromospheres of cool stars has long been debated. In the 1950's and 60's it was believed that acoustic waves emanating from the turbulent convection zone were the root of the extraordinary heating. Later, in the 1970's and 80's, FUV and X-ray studies of the Sun and nearby stars pointed to surface magnetism as the culprit.  Recently, however, the venerable acoustic mechanism has been resurrected once again, to explain the anomalous properties of the early-F stars. Intense C IV and X-ray emissions place such stars solidly in the ranks of "coronal" objects; but the curiously depressed Xray/C IV ratios, lack of a clear rotation activity connection, and apparent smooth surface distributions of activity are contrary to the expectations of dynamo magnetism.  I propose to test the reality of 'acoustic chromospheres' in the early-F stars by recording a unique time series of the pivotal H I 1215 Ly-alpha emission of the delta-Scuti star Beta Cassiopeiae (F2 III-IV) to search for signatures of global shock heating: traveling acoustic modes are most favored, and their dynamical consequences most easily discerned, in pulsationally-unstable stars, as illustrated by the shocked chromospheres of the Mira variables.|Y

BCBJL|Velocity Fields and Spectrum Peculiarities in Beta Cephei Stars|Janet R.|Lesh|Denver|We propose to use ultraviolet spectra obtained with the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) to study the velocity fields and spectrum peculiarities of a number of beta Cephei variable stars.  Line profile variations will be determined by repeated observation of the stars over one or more pulsation cycles. Profiles observed at different phases will be compared with synthetic line profiles computed in model atmospheres affected by radial or nonradial pulsation, and by depth-dependent velocity fields. The behavior of lines of different strengths and stages of ionization will be used to study the depth-dependent field.  The complete ultraviolet spectra of selected 8 Cephei stars will be compared with normal B-star spectra, in order to ascertain the existence of peculiarities that may be related to possible instability mechanisms. It seems likely that such peculiarities exist in certain stars.|Y
BCGDB|Simultaneous Observations of BW Vulpeculae with Voyager and IUE|Don C.|Barry|USC|Comparison of 912 -1680A Voyager spectra of the large amplitude Beta Cephei variable BW Vul with model atmosphere spectra has confirmed the known 4200  K effective temperature variation over the 4.8 hour period. Comparisons with about 45 other B star spectra have revealed N II 1085A and Si IV 1400A to be exceptionally strong. C III 977A appears to increase in strength towards minimum light (similar in behavior to C II 6578 and 6582A) while other features appear to vary from cycle to cycle. The continuum analysis to date suggests the star may be adequately modeled as a simple radial pulsator while the line behavior suggests otherwise. We propose to observe BW Vul simultaneously with Voyager and IUE to obtain coverage of more than 90% of the star's flux while avoiding problems with cycle to cycle variability. The broadened wavelength coverage will enable us to determine a relatively precise L Max / L Min value affording a direct comparison of the radial variations determined (1) from this ratio and Stefan's law; (2) directly from the model spectral fits; (3) from integration of the radial velocity curve. The extended continuum data would provide a coherent amplitude-wavelength relation to be compared with the model results. The absorption lines will be studied to look for variations in strength and the line strength anomalies suggested by the present Voyager data.|Y
BCIGP|Multifrequency Observations of Delta Ceti|Geraldine J.|Peters|USC|We propose to observe the low amplitude Beta Cephei star delta Ceti simultaneously with the low resolution spectrometers on IUE, the Voyager UVS, and a ground-based photometer in order to obtain independent measurements of the cyclic variation in luminosity and photospheric temperature in this star. The latter will allow one to compute the cyclic charge in radius and compare the result with the value implied by integrating the radial velocity curve. Sharp-lined beta Cephei-type stars such as delta Ceti are frequently used to determine cosmic abundances of the elements employing standard model atmosphere abundance techniques. We will assess the degree to which the current static LTE model atmospheres such as Kurucz (1979) represent these stars and estimate the errors which are introduced in the elemental abundances as a result of the star's atmospheric pulsation. In a parallel investigation during the seventh year of IUE, Barry, et al. have studied the cyclic atmospheric changes in the large amplitude beta Cephei star, BW Vul, where shocks, variable mass loss, and deviation from hydrostatic equilibrium in the atmosphere are evident. This proposed study of delta Ceti will allow a comparison of the behavior of a pulsator of low and large amplitude and provide an observational test for current pulsation theory.|Y
BCJEB|Blue Companions of Long Period Cepheids|Erika|Bohm-Vitense|Washington|We want to search for giant companions of very short and very long period Cepheids. These permit a check on the relative luminosities of giants and their Cepheid companions. which should fit on the same evolutionary tracks. For Cepheids with periods around 9 days we found a discrepancy between the observed relative luminosities and the theoretically expected values. This discrepancy might be explained by additional, probably convective overshoot, mixing at the boundaries of the convective cores of main sequence massive stars. If this is indeed the explanation we might probably expect that the mixing is mass dependent and that therefore the discrepancy between giant and Cepheid luminosities will be different for longer and shorter period Cepheids. We want to check this suspicion. If such an effect is seen it tells us about the importance of convective overshoot mixing for stars with different masses.  In order to find Cepheids with giant companions we want to look at Cepheids whose Wesselink masses are especially low. Generally, blue giant companions contribute more light in the visual spectral region than do blue main sequence companions. "Wesselink" masses determined for Cepheids with blue companions give masses which are too low because of the influence of the companion on the optical colors. For giants this effect should be quite noticeable.|Y
BCKTT|Emission in Tu Cas at Miximum Brightness|Terry J.|Teays|CSC IUE|IUE time is requested to observe the beat Cepheid TU Cas during a specific phase. Beat Cepheids pulsate in more than one mode simultaneously, and the interaction of the two modes produces a modulation of the amplitude of the light curve. There has been some controversy on the presence or absence of emission features in the H-alpha line and the Mg II h and k lines for beat Cepheids. The significance of the presence, and pulsation phase,of chromospheric emission in Mg II relates to whether or not the chromospheres in Cepheids are interpreted as being driven by pulsation, as concluded Schmidt and Parsons, or as being due to a solar-like, convectively driven, chromosphere, as concluded by Bohm-Vitense and Querci. Szabados has recently detected emission in the H-alpha line in TU Cas during the rising light portion of the light curve immediately preceding a "super maximum", i.e. at a time when the two competing pulsations conspired to reinforce each other and produce the largest change in temperature and brightness seen in the star. The present proposal is part of a coordinated campaign to study TU Cas using simultaneous groundbased spectroscopy, photometry, and IUE spectra on a specific date for which a super maximum is calculated to occur.|Y
BCLEB|Dynamical Masses for V636 SCO|Erika|Bohm-Vitense|Washington|For the Cepheid V636 Scorpii we want to determine the pulsational radial velocities for the spectral lines seen in the LWR region of the IUE Observatory. These measurements are essential for the determination of the dynamical masses for this binary.  On LWR IUE high resolution images of V636 Sco the spectrum of the Cepheid can be studied for lambda > 2400 A while the one for the companion can be studied for lambda < 2400 A for minimum light of the Cepheid. This fact permits the measurement of the difference in radial velocity for the two components of the binary system. After subtraction of the pulsational velocity of the Cepheid the difference of the orbital velocities is obtained. With the orbital velocity of the Cepheid known from optical studies the velocity ratio and thereby the mass ratio of the binary components can be determined.  So far the pulsational velocities for the Cepheid measured in the optical region have been used in this procedure. Observations show, however, that pulsational velocities are different for different layers of the atmosphere. Subtraction of the pulsational velocities determined for the absorption lines in the optical region, when we should subtract the pulsational velocities for the UV region, may cause large errors in the difference of the orbital velocities and their ratios. We therefore have during the lIth period redetermined for S Mus the pulsational velocities for those high layers in which the lines in the LWR region are formed. This requires measurements for many phases of the pulsational cycle. We want to do the same for V636 Sco.|Y
BCLNE|The Companion of the Cephein Z LAC|Nancy Remage|Evans|Canada|IUE spectra have been vital in studying binary Cepheids. Because of the temperature difference between the Cepheid and a hot main sequence companion, the spectra of the two stars can be studied in detail in different wavelength regions ("temperature resolved"). This makes possible the determination of Cepheid masses, through velocity measures of the main sequence companions on ultraviolet spectra. Luminosities can also be determined from the spectral type of the companion and the magnitude difference between the two stars. Ultraviolet spectra are also a powerful tool for investigating the distribution of mass ratios in these intermediate mass binaries.  The recent derivation of an orbit for the 10 day Cepheid Z Lac (Welch, 1988) has added to the list of Cepheids with confirmed orbital motion. The orbit is particularly interesting because it has long period (16 years) and a large mass function: f(m) = 0.59  0.22 M(sun). This implies that it has a high inclination, and is a good candidate for a mass determination by measuring the orbital velocity amplitude of the companion (and using the inferred main sequence mass), although it is too faint for an IUE high dispersion spectrum. Limits on the spectral type of the companion from the existing IUE spectra (AOV or later, M< 2.3 M(sun) are in disagreement with the lower limit to the mass of the companion from the mass function and an evolutionary mass of the Cepheid (4.2 M(sun)). Either the companion is itself a short period binary or the Cepheid may be less massive than simple evolutionary tracks predict. (Further work is in progress to improve the orbit from the ground.) A full shift SWP exposure of the Z Lac system will reveal a companion earlier than AN in the 1800A region. This will provide an absolute magnitude calibration of the Cepheid, and a mass ratio (assuming an evolutionary mass for the Cepheid). It is also a necessary step in planning for a high dispersion observation by HST. A velocity of the companion will either provide a mass ratio between two stars, and hence a mass of the Cepheid, or confirmation that the companion is itself a binary.|Y
BCMNE|Cepheid Binary Companions|Nancy Remage|Evans|Canada|Blue main sequence companions of binary Cepheids can be used to determine Clio luminosity of the Cepheids. By matching the composite spectrum of the companion and the Cepheid with those of standard stars, the spectral type of the companion and the magnitude difference between the two stars can be determined. The main sequence absolute magnitude calibration of the companion then leads to the absolute magnitude of the Cepheid. The aim of this project is to obtain low dispersion SWP spectra of three Cepheids (T Vul, Y Lac, and RS Ori) for which the LWP spectra show excess flux at 2500 from the companion.  In addition, we request LWP low dispersion spectra of five Cepheids to complete the survey of all Cepheids brighter than 8" magnitude to look for companions. Archival IUE spectra are non-existant or inadequate (no LWP or overexposed). The purpose of this survey is to accurately determine the percentage of Cepheids which are binaries, to compare with evolutionary predictions. This IUE survey will identify definitively Cepheids with blue companions, about which there is come confusion from groundbased photometric techniques, and hence prevent distortions to such parameters as luminosity, color and reddening. In addition, the distribution of mass ratios (from the spectral type of the main sequence mass and the evolutionary mass of the Cepheid (Evans and Bolton, 1989)), is basic information about star formation.|Y

BCPNE|Binary Cepheids and Stellar Evolution|Nancy Remage|Evans|ISTS - York University|An IUE study has recently been done of the evolved companions of classical Cepheid variable stars. These companions are still hot stars, but near the end of their main sequence lifetimes. The study shows that these binary systems fall into two groups. Half the eight systems can be well matched by current isochrones. Four of the systems, however, are very poorly matched by any existing isochrone. This includes isochrones from several codes, and with several values of core convective overshoot. The most important clue to these "renegade" systems is that they occur throughout the mass range of the companions. This means that an explanation in terms of a mass-dependent parameter is unlikely; however, rotation would be a reasonable explanation. The purpose of this proposal is to obtain improved spectra of two of the most important binary systems in the sample, the most luminous Cepheid, and the most luminous Cepheid system which is normal (a good fit to the isochrones). By improving the accuracy of the temperature of the companion and the magnitude difference between the two stars, the new observations will strengthen the previous results, which are providing insight into main sequence evolution. We also want to take a high resolution spectrum of Polaris to see whether the dramatic decline in pulsation amplitude since 1980 has resulted in any change in Mg II chromospheric emission.|Y
BCRJN|Wind Modulation in Beta Cep Stars|Joy S.|Nichols|CSC - Astronomy Programs|For nearly 20 years the pulsating B1 IV star beta Cep has been known to have a very significant period of 6 or 12 days in the equivalent width of many stellar wind lines like C IV, N V and Si IV, although the origin of this period is not known. Based on a new analysis of all existing IUE spectra, we recently proposed that the actual period is 12 days, which we identify with the stellar rotation period and the (weak) magnetic field controlling the wind in beta Cep. The field strength was monitored during one year, and was found to vary on a similar timescale, supporting our hypothesis. In addition, we have discovered another B star with very similar wind properties, with a preliminary period of 3.5 days, but for which no magnetic field is known. This suggests that IUE can detect magnetic stars with weaker fields than are detectable from the ground.  We propose to augment our investigation of these unusual stars for two reasons. During the last year, beta Cep suddenly showed H-alpha emission, which is declining on a yearly timescale, and we suspect that the stellar wind and measured magnetic field will show changes on this same timescale. In addition, we identified a number of other beta Cep variables with similar unusual wind behavior, but with unknown rotation periods and unknown magnetic field strengths. We propose to monitor these stars as well, both in the UV and from the ground to search for magnetic fields.|Y

BEBGP|A Comparative Study of the Far Ultraviolet Spectra of Be Stars|Geraldine J.|Peters|USC|A proposal is presented to undertake a detailed study of the ultraviolet spectra of a carefully selected sample of Be stars which display a wide range of ground-based spectral characteristics. Toward this end, a total of 72 hours (nine 8 hour periods) of observing time is requested on the International Ultraviolet Explorer to observe 25 different Be stars and three standard non-Be stars. It is desired to have the time divided into three observing runs, each with three 8 hour sessions in order to obtain adequate coverage of the sky and also to allow at least nine of the objects to be observed twice, four months apart, to look for possible variability. The observations are to be made with the high dispersion echelle spectrograph on IUE and coverage from lambda 1192 - 1924 A (short wavelength) and lambda 1893 - 3031 A (long wavelength) is desired.  Both shell and photospheric features observed in the UV will be identified and analyzed. The strengths and velocities deduced from the shell features will yield information on the temperature, density, geometry, and rate of mass loss in the circumstellar envelope. The technique of spectrum synthesis will be used to analyze the photospheric lines in order to determine the effective temperature, surface gravity, chemical composition, projected rotational velocity, and rate of mass loss for the underlying star.|Y
BEBJM|Ultraviolet Observations of BE Stars|J. M.|Marlborough|Western Ontario|The purpose of the proposal is to continue investigations of Be stars in three specific directions using ultraviolet spectral data. First, several stars previously observed from Copernicus and/or rockets will be reobserved to search for variability of ultraviolet spectroscopic features. Secondly, several late type Be stars of large v sin i will be observed in order to provide a more extensive data base for the search for stellar winds. Thirdly, a number of Be stars of low v sin i will be observed in order to see if any of these stars show evidence for stellar winds.|Y
BECAS|Ultraviolet Studies of Some Be Stars of Later Type|A.|Slettebak|Ohio State University|A number of interesting features have been observed in the ultraviolet spectra of early-type Be stars but corresponding observations for the later Be stars are much fewer. It is proposed that high-dispersion ultraviolet spectra in both the short and long wavelength ranges be obtained for a sample of B5-8 shell Be stars, plus similar spectra for several pole-on Be stars and spectral type standard stars of corresponding type, in order to (1) look for and estimate mass-loss effects from possible asymmetries in resonance and metastable lines; (2) look for ultraviolet shell lines, in order to make better estimates of the physical conditions in these shells; (3) measure ultraviolet line widths to compare with visual line widths for gravity darkening effects; (4) compare ultraviolet with visual spectral types to see whether ionization anomalies exist; and (5) correlate the above ultraviolet features with other parameters derived from visual and near IR spectra.|Y
BECJM|Variability of Be Stars in the Ultraviolet|J. M.|Marlborough|Western Ontario|We wish to study variations in the ultraviolet spectra of Be stars and to compare these with any changes in the optical region obtained from simultaneous ground based data. Perhaps one of the most important characteristics of Be stars is their variability, some aspects of which imply Be stars are 'peculiar' phases of normal B main sequence stars. We hope our investigations will provide some evidence as to which parameter or parameters of the subatmospheric structure of the star is responsible for the observed variations and thus presumably responsible for the entire complex of extended atmosphere, chromosphere-coronal and wind. We have chosen to observe 59 Cyg., theta CrB, 88 Her., and HD 50138. Previous ultraviolet and ground based data for 59 Cyg. have demonstrated remarkable changes on time scales of the order of months. For the other stars previous ground based data lead us to conclude that they are also interesting objects for study at the present time. We trust our investigations will provide additional data with which to attempt empirical modelling of those aspects of the subatmospheric structure responsible for variations in Be stars and perhaps in other hot stars as well.|Y
BEDAS|Continued Ultraviolet Studies of Be Stars of Later Types|A.|Slettebak|Ohio State University|A number of interesting features have been observed in the ultraviolet spectra of early-type Be stars but corresponding observations for the later Be stars and A-type shell stars are much fewer. It is proposed that the investigator's present IUE program be extended to include high-dispersion ultraviolet spectra in both the short and long wavelength ranges for several additional Be stars of later type (both shell stars and pole-on stars) plus a sample of A-type shell stars, including spectral type standard stars of similar type for comparison purposes, in order to (1) look for and estimate mass-loss effects from possible asymmetries in resonance and metastable lines; (2) look for ultraviolet shell Was in Order to make better estimates of the physical conditions in these shells (3) measure ultraviolet line widths to compare with visual line widths for gravity darkening effects; (4) compare ultraviolet with visual spectral types to see whether ionization anomalies exist; and (5) corrolate  the above ultraviolet features with other parameters derived from visual and near IR spectra.|Y
BEDGP|Three-Phase Diagnostics of Nonthermal and Binarity Effects of Be Stars|Geraldine J.|Peters|USC|This proposal is the result of a directed, international, joint effort by 23 researchers in 15 institutions to solve some of the persistent problems concerning the nature of and the causes for the Be phenomenon. We have concluded that the only way we can ensure that progress is made toward this goal is to concentrate our attentions on a small number of significant objects. Haphazard surveys of several objects will only waste observing time and contribute very little to our understanding of Be stars. Each of the co-investigators listed on this proposal will also contribute either ground based support (optical, infrared, or radio), X-ray data, or theoretical support for the analysis. Since this project is an international effort, this proposal has also been submitted to ESA (3 shifts requested) by V. Doazan, and SRC (3 shifts requested) by A.J. Willis. We request that the observing shifts be scheduled with a frequency of about one per month. It will not be necessary to coordinate shifts alloted by NASA, ESA or the UK.|Y
BEETS|Be Star Variability|Theodore M.|Snow|Colorado|A selection of eight Be and two "normal" B stars will be monitored for variability in ultraviolet resonance lines on timescales ranging from a few days to several months. The selection of stars and the timescales of the observations are both based on previous observations, which have shown that variations are common and have hinted at the timescales, but have not yet allowed a full physical understanding of the cause of the phenomena. An important part of the program is to compare the UV observations and the variability they reveal in the stellar winds with both short- and long-term variations in the visible emission and shell features, which will be monitored through simultaneous and more extensive ground-based observations. An additional important goal will be to coordinate IUE and EXOSAT x-ray observations, if EXOSAT is successfully launched during the fifth year of IUE operations.|Y
BEFPB|Envelope Ejection by Active Be Stars|Paul K.|Barker|W. Ontario|The UV and optical spectra of emission line B type dwarfs provide evidence for a two-component structure to the circumstellar material around Be stars: H-alpha emission arises from a cool dense slowly expanding envelope, whereas UV resonance features are formed in a superionized high velocity hot stellar wind. Optical spectra suggest a continuous sequence of H-alpha emission strength, from strong to weak (in the Be stars), through asymmetric absorption to symmetric photospheric absorption (in the normal B stars). In addition, UV spectra show that at least some normal B dwarfs have superionized winds analogous to those of the Be stars. We propose a systematic survey of H-alpha emission and UV resonance features in quiescent Be stars, over a wide range of spectral type and projected rotational velocity, to investigate the occurrence of superionized winds in a representative group of Be stars, and to determine if any relationship exists between the H-alpha emission and the hot wind. Comparison with the results of a corresponding survey of normal B stars will thus influence theoretical studies of the nature of the emission line stars, by addressing the question: Are the superionized wind and H-alpha emission related phenomena?|Y
BEFTS|A Survey of Variability in Be Stars|Theodore P.|Snow|Colorado|Five Be and one normal B stars will be monitored for variability in the ultraviolet resonance lines once a month. A primary goal of this study is determiniation of the relation between the hydrogen and uv resonance line formation zones in these stars, as a first step in the determination of the radial structure of Be atmospheres. Preliminary observations with IUE have suggested that this structure may differ from star to star, as well as depending strongly on time in a given star. Simultaneous visual observations are planned to accompany the uv observations. Due to the brightness of our targets, and consequent short exposure times, all observations may be done during U.S. shift 2.|Y
BEHCG|A Study of Stellar Winds in Late-Type Be Stars|Carol A.|Grady|CSC|Previous UV studies of Be stars have revealed many phenomena which were unanticipated from studies of the visual region spectra, including the presence of strong, highly ionized stellar winds. Preliminary surveys involving relatively small numbers of B and Be stars have shown that winds in Be stars differ significantly from those in B stars of the same spectral type, and also differ significantly from winds in O stars. The differences between normal B and Be stars apparently become more pronounced with decreasing Teff. The existing studies do not include sufficient numbers of late-type Be stars to permit study of the role of rotation spectral type, and presence or absence of an optical emission line spectrum in accounting for the difference in B and Be stellar winds. We propose a study of bright late-type Be stars including the available archival spectra and supplemented by IUE SWP and LWP high dispersion spectra as required to reasonably sample Be stars from B5 to B9.5 and O-350 km s^-1 in v sin i. These data are needed to (1) further study the frequency and distribution in radial velocity of narrow absorption components as a function of projected rotational velocity and spectral type (or Teff), (2) compare B and Be stellar wind profiles, mass loss rates, and wind ionization balances as a function of v sin i and spectral Teff,  , (3) compare B and Be star photospheric line profiles as a function of v sin i at each spectral type, and where possible, (4) study Be star wind properties as a function of metallicity. These investigations will give important clues to the mass loss phenomenon in Be stars, and complement previous IUE studies.|Y
BEHGP|IUE, Voyager, and Ground-Based Observations of Pulsating Be Stars|Geraldine J.|Peters|USC|We propose simultaneous, IUE, Voyager UVS, and ground-based (Reticon) observations of four Be stars (mu Cen, 28 Cyg, 66 Oph, and pi Aqr) which have been confirmed to be nonradial pulsators. By combining the IUE high and low resolution spectra with the Voyager UVS continuous flux measurements (900-1700A) and the ground-based observations, which will yield a model for the photospheric oscillations and phases during the course of observations, we will search for 1) cyclic variations in the integrated far uv flux and surface temperature of the star and 2) a direct link between the oscillations on the photosphere and variations in the circumstellar matter (wind, region of superionization, cool shell, etc.). We are especially interested in the response of the C IV wind line to the pulsational activity. We desire to obtain all data simultaneously over one complete pulsational cycle for the primary targets mu Cen and 28 Cyg. Two observation sessions are suggested: one combined US1 + US2 shift to cover mu Cen (P 1 = 12 hr, P 2 = 2.4 hr) and a pair of US2 shifts scheduled on successive days to observe 28 Cyg (P 1 = 17 hr, P 2 = 3 hr). Each primary target will be paired with a nearby secondary one for which we will gather fewer observations during each session.|Y
BEIGP|Far Ultraviolet Flux, Wind and Shell Variations in Be-Shell Stars|G.P.|Peters|University of Southern California|A survey of archival spectra of early B-shell stars has revealed the presence of shell variability in superionized and Less highly ionized species such as N V, AL III, and Si II. These changes appear to occur independently of any changes in the higher velocity portions of the wind P Cygni profiles seen in the same resonance transitions. In at least one case, the shell variation is associated with similar changes in low velocity discrete components. Similar profile changes are observed in Zeta Tau which is known to show far ultraviolet flux variability correlated with the changes in the shell profiles. We propose a program of monthly observations of early Be-shell stars which have either shown or are suspected of ionization variation in their shell absorption. The IUE observations will be made simultaneously with Voyager far ultraviolet spectrophotometric observations and optical spectrometry. These data are needed (1) to determine whether B-shell stars exhibit recurrent wind or shell variations, (2) to determine whether far UV flux variation is associated with changes in the shell ionization balance, and (3) to determine whether UV shell variation is associated with changing optical shell features. These investigations will give important clues to the mass loss phenomenon in early-type stars, and are complementary to similar studies for Be stars, and to short term variability studies.|Y
BEITS|UV Observations of Be Stars Studied with Iras|Theodore P.|Snow|Colorado - CASA|We propose to use IUE to obtain high-resolution ultraviolet spectra of a number of Be stars which are known to have infrared excesses and which have not been observed previously by IUE. We also propose to examine existing IUE archival data for Be stars which have already been observed by IUE. The stars chosen for this study have been observed by IRAS, and in some cases by ground-based infrared telescopes, and it is hoped that a study of these stars using both UV and IR data will lead to a better understanding of the Be phenomenon. By comparing the stellar wind properties derived from the IUE data with the known IR data on these stars, it may be possible to learn about the relation between the stellar winds Of Be stars and their extended circumstellar envelopes. In addition, the mass-loss rates and velocity laws derived from the IUE data can be used as inputs to our newly developed axisymmetric model to predict the IR excess from Be stars, and hence will allow comparison of the model with IR observations. This proposal requests observations of bright stars, all of which can be observed during NASA shift 2.|Y
BEJGP|Long-Termed far UV Flux Variability and Mass Loss in Be Stars|Geraldine J.|Peters|USC|Observations of Be stars with the Voyager spacecrafts during the past two years have revealed that the FUV flux (950 - 1150A) in three objects, which have been intensively monitored (a Eri, 66 Oph, and mu Cen), varies by 25 - 30% on a time scale of months. If this variability is due to a change in the star's effective temperature (as it appears to be in a Eri) then a AT of 750 - 1000 K is implied; if no redistribution of the flux occurs, then the fluctuation in energy output is several hundred solar luminosities. To further explore the cause for this impressive variation in the output of radiant energy from these stars and assess Its importance In the Be phenomenon, I propose a series of simultaneous Voyager, IUE, and ground-based photometric observations of selected objects. The Voyager data by itself is insufficient to tell whether the flux in 66 Oph and mu Cen varies because the photospheric temperature changes or if the FUV flux is redistributed to the near UV. Combined Voyager, low resolution IUE (SWP + LWP), and ground-based photometry would easily resolve this question. Early indications are that the level of the FUV flux is anticorrelated with activity signatures such as the strength of the C IV wind feature or the presence/intensity of H-alpha emission (just opposite what one would expect). Complementary high resolution spectra with IUE and ground-based telescopes are planned to confirm this apparent trend. The program stars and number of Voyager observations planned for each during the tenth episode for IUE are: 66 Oph (4), mu Cen (3), HR 2855 (3). and 88 Her (2). To carry through the proposed simultaneous Voyager - IUE observations of each, I request six US2 shifts scheduled with the approximate frequency of one half-shift every month. Such scheduling will easily permit us to achieve simultaneous observations with both spacecraft. Since I do not reside in the Washington area, I further request the service observing option for most of the observations. Each half-shift will be used to obtain both low (SWP + LWP) and high resolution (SWP) IUE spectra of the Voyager target; the remainder of the shift will be used to monitor the wind/shell spectra in the other program stars.|Y
BEJRP|A Study of Peculiar B-Emission Stars|Ronald S.|Polidan|Arizona|Observations of emission line stars selected on the basis of their slow Balmer decrements are proposed. Investigation of a group of 17 stars selected by Garrison from a larger survey of OB stars (Garrison, Hiltner, and Schild 1977) as having slow Balmer decrements has identified two stars, HD 122669 and HD 161774, as being likely candidates for interacting binary stars, possibly cataclysmic variables. Combined IUE/Voyager UVS observations of these two stars are proposed in order to determine whether they are active binary stars. In addition, eight "extreme" Be stars are to be observed in order to study the physical conditions in their extensive envelopes.|Y

BEKGP|Long-Term Fuv Flux, Wind, and Disk Variability in Be Stars|Geraldine J.|Peters|USC|Monthly IUE observations of a few selected Be stars are proposed for the next two years to investigate the cause for long-term (months - years) variations in their FUV flux and He I emission line profiles and look for correlations between these changes and mass loss rates from the wind. Each IUE shift will be coordinated with Voyager and/or high S/N optical observations of H-alpha and He I 6678 at KPNO or elsewhere. High resolution SWP images will be obtained to study wind variations, while low resolution data (SWP + LWP) will be acquired to tie in with Voyager and ground-based photometry.  Observations with the Voyager spacecrafts during the past three years have revealed variations up to 30% in the flux band 900 - 1150 A in several objects. Voyager data by itself, however, is insufficient to reveal the cause for the FUV flux variability (a change in the star's photospheric temperature of 500-1000K, or perhaps redistribution), but when it is combined with the IUE and optical photometry the problem can be easily resolved. CCD spectra obtained at KPNO recently show striking variability in He I 6678 in many of the same stars: this feature can change from a P Cygni to an inverse P Cygni profile, on a time scale of months. Since this line is formed primarily in the inner disk, these observations imply ongoing variations in the mass flow from the star's equatorial region. Simultaneous IUE and He 1 6678 observations will be used to look for a link between mass loss from the wind and the disk. Program stars include HR 2855 (FY CMa), mu Cen, 88 Her, 66 Oph, 59 Cyg, and pi Aqr, all of which have a history of long-term, quasi-periodic variability in their continuous flux and optical emission spectra.|Y
BEKRP|A Study of the Pulsating Be Star P Carinae|Ronald S.|Polidan|Arizona|We propose to obtain high-dispersion SWP spectra the Be star P Car (B4Ve). Recent optical observations of P Car by Porri and Stalio have shown pronounced short term variability in the He I 6678 line profile. From ESO-CAT data they have found evidence for variations in radial velocity and in the full width at half maximum of the He I 6678 line with a period of 0.35 days (8.4 hours). In addition, velocity discontinuities in the helium line profile suggests the presence of shocks in the atmosphere of P Car. The aim of this proposal is to study the behavior of the UV resonance lines profiles (C IV, Si IV, etc.) during the stellar pulsation period in order to establish if there is any relationship between the photospheric motions observed in the optical and changes in the outer stellar atmosphere/wind structure. Ground based observations will be made at ESO simultaneous with the IUE observations.|Y
BEKTS|UV Observations of Be Stars Studied with Iras|Theodore P.|Snow|Colorado - CASA|We propose to use IUE to obtain high-resolution ultraviolet spectra of a number of Be stars which are known to have infrared excesses and which have not been observed previously by IUE.

BELMS|An IUE Investigation of Flarelike Activity in Lambda Eri|Myron A.|Smith|CSC|We propose to make simultaneous IUE, Voyager, Ginga and multi-site ground-based spectroscopic observations of the B2e star lambda Eridani Recent line profile observations of this star, as well as the now well documented X-ray activity in -t Cas, suggest that apparently random, high energy events occur ubiquitously near the surfaces of some Be stars. Also, subescape ejections from this star during active phases seems to be similar to those associated with flaring in magnetically active cool stars. IUE observations provide a sensitive means of detecting temperature enhancements on the surface of an early B star. We wish to exploit this capability by monitoring A Eri simultaneously with the  IUE (3 US2 shifts) and two ground-based spectroscopic facilities in the U.S. and Japan. We will compare "transient" activity in the optical lines with that observed in a number of UV resonance line profiles. These observations will furnish a unique opportunity to test the idea that Be activity arises from flaring in temporary, chaotic knots of magnetic fields on the surfaces of these stars, and should be capable of detecting flares with equivalent temperatures between 2 x 10^4 and > 10^7 K. The proposed study complements studies of winds in Be stars that turn on and off over longer timescales with H-alpha activity.|Y
BEMCG|Coordinated IUE and ROSAT Observations of Be Stars|Carol A.|Grady|Catholic University|UV studies of Be stars have revealed that these objects have stronger stellar winds containing more high temperature plasma than is found in normal B stars. The winds in these objects are dominated by features, the discrete absorption components, which are believed to be signatures of shock-ionized plasma exhibiting sufficiently high velocities that these stars should have soft x-ray luminosities greater than those of normal stars of comparable Teff. L(BOL) and v sin i when the star is in a strong wind state.  This hypothesis can be tested by comparing near-simultaneous x ray and UV observations of a group of Be stars. The launch of the ROSAT, with its unparalleled sensitivity to soft x-rays, and the continued operation of the IUE provide an unique opportunity to address this problem. We propose using the IUE SWP camera in high dispersion to obtain C IV profiles of 6 approved ROSAT targets as close in time as feasible to the ROSAT observations. These data will be used to unambiguously identify the state of the wind at the time of the x-ray observations.|Y
BEMGP|Far Variability and Mass Loss in the "Rapid Variable" Be Stars|Geraldine J.|Peters|USC|Following our confirmation that it is a modulation of the photospheric temperature that primarily causes the short-term (rapid) optical light variations in Be stars and the discovery of a phase-dependent variation in the wind, we propose to investigate whether there is evidence that a mechanical input of energy from nonradial pulsations produces this activity and if the generic model for a nonradial pulsator with a low order sectorial mode (l=2,3) generally represents this class of objects. We will look for enhanced phasedependent variations in the wind of a Be star (eta Cen) that shows a much larger fluctuation in its optical light (0.1 mag) and is apparently pulsating in an l=3 mode. Previous efforts have concentrated on stars with smaller amplitudes (<0.05 mag) pulsating in an 1-2 mode. We will then look for a confirmation (in 48 Lib) that the C IV emission intensity in Be-shell stars is anticorrelated with the FUV flux and that the amplitude of the FUV light curves correlates with v sin i (from mu Cen and chi Oph). Both are predicted by the l=2 NRP model. We plan simultaneous IUE, Voyager, and ground-based spectroscopic (Reticon or CCD), photometric, and polarimetric observations at several sites worldwide. To minimize data gaps which in the past have confused interpretation, we suggest 64 continuous hours of IUE observations (detailed above). This will enable us to observe the primary target eta Cen over slightly more than one cycle in its triple-wave curve and cover six cycles in 48 Lib. The observations will allow us to discriminate between two different models which are still discussed to explain rapid variability: nonradial pulsations or starspots.|Y
BENGP|Multiwavelength Observations of "Rapid Variable" Be-Shell Stars|Geraldine J.|Peters|USC|Multiwavelength campaigns that we have carried through during the past three years have confirmed that the short-term (rapid) optical light variability observed in Be stars is primarily caused from a modulation in the star's photospheric temperature and revealed an interesting phase-dependent variation in the wind. To investigate whether mechanical input of energy from nonradial pulsations (NRP) produces this activity and is important in driving the mass loss in Be stars we propose simultaneous IUE, Voyager, and ground-based spectroscopic, photometric, and polarimetric observations of two Be-shell stars (zeta Tau and psi Per), which we believe are viewed equator-on and thus will make the effects of NRP especially observable. We will look for enhanced phase-dependent variations in the winds, which we expect since these objects display larger photometric amplitudes than did our previous program stars, and confirmation of the wind behavior we observed in the Beshell star epsilon Cap. From a comparison of photometric/spectroscopic and expected rotational periods and detailed modelling of the photospheric activity, we should be able to discriminate between two competing models for rapid variability: nonradial pulsations and starspots. To minimize data gaps that have previously confused interpretation and obtain necessary coverage over 3-4 light cycles, we suggest 64 hours of continuous IUE coverage (detailed above).|Y
BENRH|B (e) Supergiants in the Magellanic Clouds|Roberta M.|Humphreys|U Minnesota|The B[e] supergiants in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) form a distinct class of peculiar high-luminosity early-type emission-line stars. B[e] supergiants are distinguished by the presence of hot circumstellar dust and the simultaneous presence of narrow low-excitation emission-lines of FeIl, [FeIII], [OII and broad absorption features (v = 1000-2000 km/s) of higher excitation, in particular of SiIV, CIV and NV in the satellite UV (cf. Zickgraf et al. 1985, 1986). Zickgraf et al. showed that these peculiar characteristics can be explained by a twocomponent wind model with a hot fast line-driven normal OB star wind in the polar region and a dense, cool and slowly expanding wind component in the equatorial region, which is called excretion disk. A better understanding of the excretion disk of the B[e] supergiants requires highresolution IUE spectra, which are so far available for only two B[e] supergiants. We propose to observe Hen S22 in both the LWP and SWP range, and R50 and R82 in the LWP range. These stars are supposed to be equator-on B[e] supergiants. The observations will be used to investigate the wind characteristics, to derive more accurate mass-loss rates than the previously available estimates and to study the accelerating force of the excretion disk.|Y
BEOKH|The Broad Emission and Absorption Line Region in NGC 3516|Keith|Horne|STScI|Recent optical monitoring has revealed rapid Balmer emission line and optical continuum variability. on timescales of a few days - weeks. together with variations in the Balmer absorption lines on similar timescales. in the Seyfert I galaxy NGC3516. Previous poorly sampled IUE data. also reveal strong and. when sampling permits, rapid ultraviolet line and continuum variability. The combination of emission and absorption line variability makes NGC3516 a prime candidate for IUE monitoriing. We therefore propose to monitor NGC3516 with IUE for a period of 58 days in order to (1) determine the structure of the broad emission line region, and compare it to other active galactic nuclei, (2) determine the nature of the broad absorption line region and it's relationship with the emission line region, (3) determine the kinematics of the emission line gas. and (4) determine the continuum variability characteristics. Contemporaneous optical spectroscopic data will be obtained for comparison with the IUE data. We will also seek to obtain contemporaneous ROSAT observations to further constrain the continumn emission mechanisms.|Y
BEPGP|Long-Term Wind Variability and Photospheric Activity in Nearby Be Stars|Geraldine J.|Peters|USC|Monthly IUE observations of several bright, nearby Be stars are proposed during the next two years to 1) establish the current behavior in their winds to support EUVE and proposed ROSAT studies of their hightemperature circumstellar plasmas, 2) confirm the (quasi)-periodicity of activity cycles that have been discovered for some stars using archival IUE data, 3) look for activity cycles in other objects, and 4) study the effect of apparent changes in their photospheric temperatures on subsequent changes in their winds. Emphasis will be placed on high energy phenomena. Four of the program stars (alpha Eri, kappa Dra, mu Cen, and lamda Eri) have been approved for EUVE observations in 1993 to search for a 10^5 - 10^7 K plasma that contemporary theories of disk formation and episodic activity predict. To interpret any EUV emission that may be found in these objects, we need information on the wind density and nature of any prior episodic activity around the time of the EUVE observation, and this will be supplied by data on the C IV wind line. IUE observations of two Be stars with apparent quasi-periodic activity cycles (lambda Eri and 66 Oph) during the 1980s revealed that the narrow components to the C IV wind line display their largest outflow velocities (< 1000 km/s) prior to an outburst in the wind; we will look for this behavior in other Be stars. Finally we will investigate the thermal state of the star's photosphere prior to an outburst or dramatic change in the wind properties.|Y
BEPJN|Discrete Absorption Components and the Be Star Phenomenon|Joy|Nichols-Bohlin|CSC - Astronomy Programs|Our multi-year, multi-wavelength study of Discrete Absorption Components, now known to be present in most wind profiles of O stars and B supergiants, has led to the conclusion that the variability of the stellar wind in O stars may originate close to the photosphere. This analysis supports a shocked-wind model in which rotation is important. The only nonsupergiant stars later than O-type that have been observed to exhibit DACs are Be stars, for which the variability of the DACs, both in intensity and velocity, is much greater than for the O stars. It has been suggested that the occurrence and variability of DACs in Be stars may be correlated with the V/R ratio, which would imply a density dependency.  While some Be stars have been monitored extremely well over the lifetime of  IUE, the statistical sampling of Be monitoring is small. We propose to observe a group of bright Be stars that have rarely been observed with IUE, searching for DACs, complemented with existing and planned ground-based coverage to define the V/R correlations. The purpose is to increase the sampling of Be stars observed with IUE and provide a sufficient timeline of IUE coverage parallel to ground-based observations to draw firm conclusions on the frequency of occurrence and source of DACs in these stars.|Y
BEPMS|Coorelated UV/Optical Line Profile Variations in Mild Be Stars|Myron A.|Smith|CSC - Astronomy Programs|Mild classical Be stars offer an opportunity to monitor instabilities near the stars' surfaces that may ultimately be responsible for the "Be (episodic mass loss) phenomenon." In a previous study of the mild-Be prototype lambda Eri, we discovered shortlived "dimple" shaped features in the He I lambda 6678 line of this star ~40% of the time. In 1990 we were awarded three shifts of IUE time simultaneous with optical spectroscopy. Our observations demonstrated that the C IV and perhaps N V resonance doublet usually weaken by 15-25% when a dimple appears in that star's He I lambda 6678 line. In this proposal we ask for four shifts of IUE time to search for this UV/optical line correlation for four other mild Be stars in which dimples have just been discovered.  If the C IV lines weaken when optical line "dimples" appear, as was true for our campaign on lambda Eri, then we will have a new density diagnostic from which to estimate the masses of structures responsible for the dimples. If these masses bear out present estimates, we could have a new means to study the circulation between the photosphere and the environs of a Be star.|Y
BERGP|Multiwavelength Observatios of the Variable Be Star Alpha Eridani|Geraldine J.|Peters|USC|Multiwavelength observations are proposed of the bright Be star alpha Eri (Achernar), for which recent observations with the EUV spectrometer on the Galileo spacecraft have revealed unusually large (~30% peak-to-peak), daily (P=1.283 days) variations in its 900-1200 A flux.  alpha Eri differs from the other "rapid variable" Be stars that we have studied in previous campaigns in two important ways: 1) we believe that it is oscillating in an l = 1 mode (traveling wave with a crest on one hemisphere and a trough on the other) instead of an l = 2 mode, and 2) the photometric variations in the FUV are about twice as large as those we have previously seen. We will look for enhancement in the mass loss on the hemisphere containing the hot crest, further investigate whether mechanical input of energy from NRP produces the photometric variability and is important in driving the mass loss in Be stars, and compare the activity in this object with that observed in its more weakly varying counterparts. In particular, we seek to confirm an apparent correlation that shows a greater wind modulation in the stars that display larger flux variations. Simultaneous IUE and ground-based spectroscopic, photometric, and polarimetric observations at several sites worldwide are planned. Profile variations in the C IV wind line will provide a critical test of two competing models for shortterm variability: nonradial pulsations (NRP) and rotational modulation (RM).|Y
BERJN|Discrete Absorption Components and the Be Star Phenomenon|Joy S.|Nichols|CSC - Astronomy Programs|Our multi-year, multi-wavelength study of Discrete Absorption Components, now known to be present in most wind profiles of O stars and B supergiants, has led to the conclusion that the variability of the stellar wind in O stars may originate close to the photosphere. This analysis supports a shocked-wind model in which rotation is important. The only nonsupergiant stars later than O-type that have been observed to exhibit DACs are Be stars, for which the variability of the intensity, velocity, and timeline of the DACs is much greater than for the O stars. It has been suggested that the occurrence and variability of DACs in Be stars may be correlated with the V/R ratio, which would imply a density dependency.  While many Be stars have been monitored extremely well over portions of the lifetime of IUE, the coverage is not uniformly distributed. We propose to observe a group of bright Be stars that have nonuniform coverage with IUE, analyzing the long-term behavior of the DACs, complemented with existing and planned ground-based coverage to define the V/R correlations. The purpose is to increase the sampling of Be stars observed with IUE and provide a sufficient timeline of IUE coverage parallel to ground based observations to draw firm conclusions on the frequency of occurrence and source of DACs in these stars.|Y
BERMS|The Ultraviolet Response to X-Ray Flaring in Lambda Eri|Myron A.|Smith|CSC - Astronomy Programs|This is a request for Target of Opportunity IUE observations (one shift) to accompany approved ASCA X-ray observations (8 hrs.) of the mild Be star lambda Eri. We are currently planning a ground-based spectroscopic campaign to coincide with the ASCA time. There is good evidence that the instabilities in the atmosphere of this star lead to episodic ejections of a circumstellar envelope and enhanced wind flux. These observations will provide the first test of whether X-ray flares in this star (known to exist) excite a response in the photospheric lines These include the UV C IV and N V and the He I lines in the optical/red. Simultaneous IUE observations will provide unique data for this flare-photosphere connection.|Y

BFNSA|IUE Spectrophotometry of Main Sequence B, A, and F Stars|Saul J.|Adelman|Citadel|We propose to obtain low dispersion trailed SWP and LWP exposures of selected main sequence B, A, and F stars. These data will be used to derive spectral energy distributions which are essential to fitting model atmospheres as part of a program to establish fundamental elemental abundances. We will combine properly exposed IUE data with high quality optical fluxes, preferably spectrophotometry, and compare this data and high quality Balmer line profiles with the predictions of model atmospheres. The IUE data and Kurucz's new version of his model atmospheres code, which incorporates line opacities based on extensive calculations for iron peak species, should remove systematic errors in the effective temperatures. Comparison of the observed with predicted energy distributions will demonstrate whether the former can be fit in detail, provide information on the rnicroturbulence, and/or whether we are observing a pole-on fast rotating star. As these stars will be analyzed consistently with some normal mid 13 through early A stars now being studied by Adelman, Leckrone and their associates, these studies will increase both the number and the temperature range of the analyses and provide a strong connection with elemental abundance studies of the Sun.|Y

BIHTS|Ultraviolet Observations of Be Stars with Known Infrared Excesses|Theodore P.|Snow|Colorado|We propose to use IUE to obtain high-resolution, far-ultraviolet spectra of a number of Be stars which are known to exhibit infrared excesses and which have not been observed previously by IUE. Additionally we propose to use existing IUE archival data for Be stars which have already been observed by IUE. The stars chosen for this study have been observed by IRAS, and in some cases by ground-based infrared observers, and it is hoped that a study of these stars using both UV and IR data will lead to a better understanding of the Be phenomenon. By comparing the stellar wind properties derived from the IUE data with the known IR data on these stars, it may be possible to learn about the relationship between the stellar winds of Be stars and their extended circumstellar envelopes. In addition, the mass-loss rates and velocity laws derived from the IUE data can be used as inputs to a newly developed axisymmetric model to predict the IR excess from Be stars, and hence to compare the model with IR observations. The proposal requests observations of relatively bright objects, all of which can be observed during NASA shift 2.|Y
BIOPS|The UV Spectrum of the Low-Mass X-Ray Binary 2S0921-630|Paul C.|Schmidtke|Arizona State University|Although accretion disks in low-mass X-ray binaries radiate primarily in the UV, very few systems have been investigated using IUE. We propose that the long-period source 2S0921-630 be observed to study properties of its disk. The specific objectives are to compare the X-ray-UV-optical energy distribution to models of accretion disks and to determine the physical conditions of the line-emitting region from analysis of emission lines. The results for 2S0921-630 will be compared to those of Cyg X-2, the only other longperiod system that has been observed using this technique.|Y

BLBKH|Second-Epoch Observations for Spectral Variations in BL Lacertae Objects|Karen R. H.|Hackney|W Kentucky|The investigators propose to make second-epoch observations of optically variable BL Lacertae objects to complete their originally proposed study of UV spectral variations, for which the initial-epoch measurements were obtained during the first round of participation in the IUE program, demonstrating the detectability of objects in the class. The purposes of the continued study are: (1) to determine redshifts and distances using emission lines which may become visible relative to the continuum as the sources vary, (2) to learn the nature of variations in the UV continuum energy distribution for constraining models of the emission mechanism, and (3) to determine the relationship between the continuum source and the possible emission-line source in BL Lacertae objects for comparison with the canonical quasi-stellar objects. Nearly simultaneous observations in optical and other wavelengths by cooperating ground-based observers serve to extend the spectral baseline of the study.|Y
BLCAG|Multifrequency Observations of BL Lac Objects and Other Active Nuclei|A. E.|Glassgold|New York University|IUE observations are proposed for BL Lac objects and active nuclei as part of a series of multifrequency measurements ranging from the radio to the X-ray bands. The main objective of this research is to measure the continuous emission from these objects, and especially its variability as a function of frequency. The observations would be repeated at intervals of 5-10 days and 6 months. The results should be important in understanding the nature of the continuum emission in QSO like objects in general.|Y
BLCDW|A Study of 3 BL Lac Objects|Diana M.|Worrall|UC SD|We propose to observe three BL Lac objects, planning coordinated simultaneous observations, where possible, at radio, optical and X-ray wavelengths. The objects selected, BL Lac, OJ 287 and OQ 530 are such as to complement the proposals of Kondo et al., who have chosen primarily on the X-ray brightness criterion, and Hackney and Hackney, who are surveying a larger sample. Cooperation where there may be overlap is requested. Recent results from a simultaneous observation from the radio to X-ray band of Mk 501, in collaboration with the above mentioned and other investigators, emphasise the desirability of coordinated measurements. The instantaneous spectrum has allowed us to set constraints on some of the possible energy mechanism scenarios. The objects here are chosen because they are among the most variable at optical and radio wavelengths. It is furthermore noted that of the optically brightest they have X-ray to optical ratios at least a factor of 10 less than for Mk 421 and Mk 501. The reason is at present unclear. It is hoped that, by making two separated observations of at least one of the objects, it will be seen at different intensity levels. Our objective is, from the spectra, to investigate the energy generation mechanisms.|Y
BLCRH|Spectral Characteristics and Behavior Intrinsic to the Compact Variable in BL Lac Objects|Richard|Hackney|W Kentucky|The investigators propose to obtain IUE observations of the spectra of optically variable BL Lacertae objects for comparison with previous-epoch IUE observations to continue their originally proposed study of UV spectral variations in these sources. The initial-epoch observations demonstrated the detectability of objects in the class and serve to define the spectral characteristics for particular luminosity levels in the observed objects. The purposes of the study in progress are: (1) to determine the energy distribution in the spectrum intrinsic to the compact nonthermal source, (2) to study the variation of the spectral energy distribution as the optical luminosity varies, and (3) to determine redshifts and distances using emission lines which may become detectable relative to the continuum as the sources vary. Each determination will help to constrain proposed models for the source and emission mechanisms. Nearly simultaneous observations in optical and other wavelengths by cooperating ground-based observers and x-ray observations with HEAO-2 will serve to extend the spectral baseline of the study.|Y
BLCYK|Simultaneous Observations of BL Lac Objects with the IUE and HEAO-2|Yoji|Kondo|NASA/GSFC|We propose to obtain simultaneous observations of four BL Lac objects in the ultraviolet and X-ray (HEAO-2) regions to study the "instantaneous" spectral energy distribution and their variations. The results already obtained for MK 501 and the preliminary results for the three remaining objects obtained in 1979 point out the importance of the simultaneity of observation as the X-ray emission is variable in at least three of the proposed objects. Our objective is to investigate the energy generation mechanism in the BL Lac objects, which is quite probably akin to, if not the same as, that in quasars.|Y
BLDAG|Multifrequency Observations of BL Lac Objects & Violently Variable Qsos|A. E.|Glassgold|New York University|IUE observations Of BL Lac objects and violently variable QSOs are proposed in conjunction with simultaneous measurements at other frequencies. The main objective of the research is to determine the continuous emission of variable active galactic nuclei and to measure the variability of a selected subset. The results are important for understanding the basic physical properties of QSO like objects. Detection of continuum absorption shortward of the Lyman edge and of Lyman-alpha absorption would also provide information on intervening material.|Y
BLDDW|Simultaneous Multifrequency Observations of BL Lacertae Objects|Diana M.|Worrall|UC SD|We propose to observe 4 BL Lac objects, planning coordinated simultaneous observations, where possible, at radio, infrared, optical and X-ray wavelengths. This proposal represents an extension of our IUE third year program in which we have time allocated for similar observations of 3 other BL Lac objects. Recent X-ray detections of BL Lac objects imply that the peak power per energy decade lies in the ultraviolet for this class of active galactic nuclei. A spectral break has already been observed with IUE for one BL Lac object (Kondo et al. 1980), and we propose to search other candidates for such a feature. The lack of detectable gas in these objects presents them as good study objects in the persuit of understanding energy generation in active galactic nuclei in general. Our objective is to measure spectra in order to identify those components in an individual source which have physical connections and thence to constrain theoretical models. Since variability on timescales of months or shorter is reported for BL Lac objects, the simultaneity, at least to within the time for significant flux changes, is an important aspect of this proposal. However, the fact that these objects are so variable, and thus provide additional model constraints relating to source sizes, is an additional reason for believing that they are among the best candidates for investigation of the energy generation mechanisms in active galactic nuclei.|Y
BLDYK|Quasi-Simultaneous Observations of BL LAC Objects in Several Wavelength Regions|Yogi|Kondo|NASA/GSFC|We propose to obtain quasi-simultaneous observations of five BL Lac objects in the ultraviolet and X-ray (HEAO-2) regions to study the "instantaneous" spectral energy distribution and their variations; ground-based optical and radio observations will also be scheduled. The results obtained for MK 501 and the preliminary results for the four remaining objects obtained in 1979 and 1980 point out the importance of the simultaneity of observation as the X-ray emission is variable in at least three of the proposed objects. Our objective is to investigate the energy generation mechanism in the BL Lac objects, which is quite probably akin to, if not the same as in, quasars|Y
BLEAG|Multifrequency Observations of BL Lac Objects, Violently Variable Quasars|A. E.|Glassgold|New York University|IUE observations of BL Lac objects and violently variable quasars are proposed in conjunction with simultaneous measurements at radio, infrared, optical and X-ray frequencies in order to obtain the time frozen spectra at several epochs. These measurements allow the determination of the physical properties of the emitting region. Another goal is the detection of continuum absorption shortward of the Lyman edge and of Lyman-alpha absorption, which provide information on the amount of intervening material.|Y
BLEDW|Multifrequency Observations of Active Galactic Nuclei|Diana M.|Worrall|UC SD|We note an interesting discovery from IUE observations of BL Lac objects to date is that the X-ray and UV flux appear to originate from the same region in a source, as a single emission component (For several of the objects, we could not have concluded this were it not for the fact that the IUE data indicate a spectral break and steepening of the visual flux distribution). Therefore, the overall flux distribution in members of this class of active galactic nuclei (AGN) possibly provides us with a "signature" by which we can better understand the physical processes at work However, we must decide whether or not such a "signature" is associated with one particular energy production mechanism. The observational situation concerning other AGNs, e.g. quasars and Seyfert galaxies appears to be different, and comparisons between classes will be possible as more data are accumulated. However, since the spectra of BL Lac objects are not obviously "contaminated" by radiation associated with gas clouds, they are among the best candidates for energy mechanism investigations. The objects from which we propose final target selection, primarily on the basis of visual magnitude just prior to our shift allotment, have all been observed with the imaging detectors of the Einstein X-ray Observatory and so we can test for spectral extrapolation, although we must include an additional uncertainty due to possible flux variability. We propose to coordinate simultaneous observations at radio, millimeter, infrared and visual wavelengths and have calculated time periods during which this will be possible. This is a vital element of our program since an AGN tends to exhibit differences in its flux variability characteristics in the different available wavebands. We can then test the overall energy flux distribution against predictions of various energy production models. The work continues our previous IUE investigations.|Y
BLEHM|IUE Observations of BL Lac Objects & OVVQquasars|H. Richard|Miller|Georgia|IUE observations of BL Lac objects and OVV quasars are proposed in an effort to study and understand the nature of the physical processes responsible for the strongly polarized and violently variable continuum. The IUE observations will be coordinated with contemporaneous observations of the same objects at optical and radio wavelengths in order to obtain a simultaneous spectrum of the object. These results will provide important new insights, not only into the processes responsible for the characteristics associated with BL Lac objects, but also to the understanding of the quasar phenomenon in general.|Y
BLEKH|Temporal Variations in the Spectra of Active BL Lac Objects|Karen R. H.|Hackney|W. Kentucky|The proposed study involves IUE observations of the actively variable BL Lac objects OJ 287 and BL Lac for purposes of (1) determining the ultraviolet spectral energy distributions intrinsic to the compact, nonthermal source components, (2) observing the nature of variations in the spectral energy distributions as the sources vary on short timescales, and (3) detecting emission lines which may become visible when the continuum source is very weak. The targets have been selected for their high degree of variability on short timescales relative to other sources in the class of BL Lac objects. Additionally, it is estimated that their ultraviolet spectra contain no more than 1% contamination due to light from an associated galaxy, and the IUE observations will therefore represent the spectrum intrinsic to the active non-thermal component of the sources. Variations in the spectral energy distributions observed on short timescales in these sources can set very restrictive limitations on possible physical mechanisms and source parameters. Apparent spectral variations with timescale on the order of a day, as indicated in at least one pair of previous IUE observations of OJ 287, should be corroborated, and the nature of changes in the spectrum as the source increases and decreases in brightness should be elucidated. Optical UBVI photometry and observations at centimeter and millimeter wavelengths will be obtained before, during, and after the IUE observing runs for comparison with the behavior at ultraviolet wavelengths.|Y
BLEYK|Synoptic Observations of BL LAC Objects in Several Wavelength Regions|Yoji|Kondo|NASA/GSFC|We propose to obtain quasi-simultaneous observations of five BL Lac objects in the ultraviolet, visible, and radio regions to study the "instantaneous" spectral energy distribution of each object, as well as the variation in that distribution. Because of the variable nature of the emission from these objects, concurrent observations in different wavelength regions are important. Our objective is to investigate the energy generation mechanism in BL Lac objects, which is probably related in some way to that of quasars.|Y
BLFAG|Multifrequency Observations of BL Lac Objects and Violently Variable Quasars|A. E.|Glassgold|New York University|IUE observations of BL Lac objects and violently variable quasars are proposed in conjunction with measurements at radio, infrared, optical, and X-ray frequencies in order to obtain simultaneous spectra at several epochs. The measurements will be used to determine physical properties of the continuum emitting regions. Emphasis will be placed on particular sources which undergo major outbursts.|Y
BLFDW|Coordinated Multifrequency Observations of Variable Agns|Diana M.|Worrall|UC SD|Our ME measurements of BL Lac objects to date, coordinated with observations in other frequency bands, show positive spectral curvature within the infrared to ultraviolet energy range (Worrall and Bruhweiler 1982). There is evidence that this component is synchrotron radiation. In order to fit the spectral measurements, we find that relativistic beaming is an essential ingredient of simple models not involving electron reacceleration. It is important to discover to what extent this is observationally true of all BL Lac objects, and to then compare with expectations of the distribution in Lorentz factor derived from geometrical arguments. Our sample of BL Lac objects so far numbers 5. There are 17 other BL Lac objects for which IUE observations are listed in the master catalogue. However, many of these objects are so heavily contaminated by a galactic component in the visual and near infrared that the data cannot be usefully employed for our purpose. Also, to our knowledge, the necessary nearly simultaneous coverage in the infrared and visual only exists for 6 of these 17. The near-simultaneity is a vital element, since these active galactic nuclei (AGNs) tend to exhibit different flux variability characteristics in the different available wavebands. We present a target list primarily composed of BL Lac objects, but including 3 QSOs. Conclusions from non-simultaneous multifrequency observations by Malkan and Sargent (1982) suggest that one difference between QSOs and BL Lacs is that the non-thermal infrared to ultraviolet QSO flux does not appear to exhibit curvature. We would like to investigate this more closely, with simultaneous observations. We propose to coordinate all our observations with radio, millimeter, infrared and visual wavelength coverage and have calculated time periods during which this will be possible. Final target selection from our list of visually variable objects will be based on their magnitudes just prior to shift allotment.|Y
BLFYK|Coordinated Observations of BL Lacertae Objects in Several Wavelength Regions|Yoji|Kondo|NASA/GSFC|We propose to use the IUE satellite to observe six BL Lacertae objects as part of a comprehensive program of complete, quasisimultaneous spectral coverage from radio through X-ray frequencies. All of our targets are known X-ray sources. The spectra obtained, as well as any observed variability in the emission, are probes of the physical processes occurring in these sources, and will help determine the nature of BL Lac objects and how they relate to other active galactic nuclei.|Y
BLGAG|Multifrequency Observations of BL Lac Objects and Violently Variable Quasars|A. E.|Glassgold|New York University|We propose to continue to obtain IUE observations of BL Lac objects and violently variable quasars that are simultaneous with measurements at radio, submillimeter, IR, optical and X-ray frequencies. We plan to obtain (1) single epoch spectra of new sources;; (2) further observations of the ongoing flare in the BL Lac object OJ 287; (3) measurements of a new outburst in a source to be identified by optical monitoring of our target list, and (4) data on the time dependence of the dramatic spectral turnover in BL Lac. These multifrequency spectra will be used to examine how emission in different spectral bands are related and to determine the physical properties of the continuum emitting regions.|Y
BLGCB|Simultaneous Multi-Wavelength Observations of Highly Variable BL LACS|C. Stuart|Bowyer|Berkeley|We propose to obtain IUE observations of two pairs of highly variable BL Lac objects, contingent upon our obtaining time for X-ray measurements on Exosat. The IUE observations will be carried out simultaneously with Exosat X-ray observations, optical spectroscopy at Lick Observatory, 21 cm and millimeter wave observations at the Hat Creek Observatory of U.C. Berkeley and radio flux monitoring with the 5K telescope at Cambridge, England. Additional measures at other radio frequencies are being arranged elsewhere. Simultaneous observations across a wide wavelength baseline provide the most promising means of differentiating between possible mechanisms for the energy generation process and should help to determine the applicability of jet models to the BL Lac phenomenon.|Y
BLGYK|Coordinated Observations of X-Ray Bright BL Lacertae Objects|Yoji|Kondo|NASA/GSFC|We propose to use the IUE satellite to observe six BL Lacertae objects as part of a comprehensive program of complete, quasi-simultaneous spectral coverage in the radio, visual, ultraviolet, and X-ray wavebands. All of our targets are known X-ray sources, and five of the six have been observed previously with IUE. The composite spectra obtained, as well as any observed variability in the emission, are probes of the physical processes occurring in these sources, and will be used to constrain models For the emitting region.|Y
BLHAG|Multifrequency Observations of BL Lac Objects and Violently Variable Quasars|A. E.|Glassgold|New York University|We propose to continue our program of IUE observations Of BL Lac objects and violently variable quasars that are simultaneous with measurements at radio, submillimeter, IR, optical, and X-ray frequencies. This year we plan to use variability to determine the connection of the UV emission with the emission at other wavebands. Our observations will include a study of the ongoing flare of the BL Lac object OJ 287, as well as other objects for which first epoch multifrequency spectra including EXOSAT X-ray coverage have already been secured. we also plan to search for unambiguous evidence of thermal emission from an accretion disk using a specially selected red quasar.|Y
BLIDH|Spectra of BL LAC Objects Through Improved Continuum Definition|Donald J.|Hutter|A. R. Corp.|The objective of this project is to establish ultraviolet spectral energy distributions, based upon uniformly processed and calibrated data, for all the BL Lacertae objects objects which data exist in the IUE data archives. We intend to reprocess one pair of contemporaneous long and short wavelength spectra (when available) for each source by a new extraction technique designed to improve the definition of the continuum in such long duration high background exposures. The project outlined in this proposal is part, of a larger one compiling the overall spectral energy distributions of BL Lacertae objects from the radio through X-rays. These overall spectra will then be compared with models of the energy generation and radiation for these sources.|Y
BLIHM|Ultraviolet Observations of BL Lac Objects|H. Richard|Miller|Georgia|IUE observations of the BL Lac objects PG 1553 + 11 and PKS 2201 + 044 are proposed in an-effort to study and understand the nature of the physical processes responsible for the strongly polarized and violently variable continuum. The IUE observations will be coordinated with contemporaneous observations of the same objects at optical and radio wavelengths in order to obtain a "time-frozen" spectrum for each object. These results, combined with existing x-ray observations for class two objects, will provide important new insights, not only into the processes responsible for the characteristics associated with these BL Lac objects, but also to the understanding of the quasar phenomenon in general.|Y
BLKCU|Multifrequency Observations of Bl Lac Objects|C. Megan|Urry|STScI|We have an ongoing program to use the IUE  satellite, with coordinated observations at other wavelengths, to obtain multifrequency spectra of X-ray-bright BL Lacertae objects. The composite spectra are probes of the physical processes occurring in these Sources, and can be used to constrain models for the emitting region. Particularly valuable as a diagnostic is spectral evolution during changes in intensity, which can be probed only with repeated observations. Although our complete target list includes nine objects. we are asking for time to observe only the four highpriority targets. which will be observed next year with Ginga and/or Voyager 2 by the PI of this proposal.|Y
BLKSB|Continuum Processes in BL Lacertae Objects|Steven A.|Balbus|Virginia|The X-ray emission from many BL Lac objects is not a smooth extension of the IR-UV synchrotron emission, but is caused by another process. Two competing theories for the origin of this X-ray emission is the familiar synchrotron-self-Compton model and the recent pair cascade model. A critical test of both models can be made by obtaining a series of observations of BL Lac that include UV observations in conjunction with data from the millimeter to the X-ray waveband. This experiment was not possible before the launch of GINGA, and the special properties of BL Lac make it uniquely suited for this program.|Y
BLLCU|Coordinated Multifrequency Observations of X-Ray Bright Bl Lacertae Pbjects|C. Megan|Urry|STScI|We have an ongoing program to use the IUE satellite, with coordinated observations at other wavelengths, to obtain multifrequency spectra of X-ray-bright BL Lacertae objects. The composite spectra are probes of the physical processes occurring in these sources and can be used to constrain models for the emitting region. Particularly valuable as a diagnostic is spectral evolution during changes in intensity, which can be probed only with repeated observations. Although our complete target list includes nine objects, we are asking for time to observe only the four higb-priority targets listed in Table 1, which will be observed next year with Ginga and/or Voyager 2 by the PI of this proposal. However, if any of the other five targets flares during the next year (as revealed by optical monitoring of these objects by the University of Florida), it may become higher priority. Recent experience shows that we can coordinate multiwavelength campaigns with very little notice.|Y
BLNCU|Intensive Multifrequency Monitoring of PKS 2155-204|C. Megan|Urry|STScI|In order to test models of continuum emission of BL Lac objects, which predict strong correlations between emission at different wavelengths, we propose a month-long campaign to monitor intensively PKS2155-304. This source is one of the brightest and most strongly variable BL Lacs in the UV and Xray bands, making it possible to take advantage of the unprecedented UV, extreme-UV, and soft X-ray coverage afforded by the combination of Rosat and IUE. The proposed high-density, regular sampling will allow measurement of cross-correlation functions between different continuum frequency bands, especially the strength and structure of the correlation between the UV and X-ray bands. The campaign will also cover optical, infrared, and radio frequencies. The data will allow us to: a) assess the contributions of the Compton and Synchrotron mechanisms for the production of the high frequency continuum; b) estimate the size of the emission region at different frequencies; c) evaluate the relativistic jet model for BL Lacs; and d) study the process responsible for the variability by mapping the evolution of flares in frequency and time. The ultimate goal is to understand the origin of the continuum emission.|Y
BLOGM|Coordinated UV and EUV Observations of BL Lac Objects and Seyferts|Grzegorz M.|Madejski|USRA|We propose to study the far- and extreme ultraviolet emission in four BL Lac objects and two Seyfert galaxies. We wish to observe these objects simultaneously with the IUE, Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer (EUVE), ROSAT, the Voyager Ultraviolet Spectrometers (VUVS), and ground-based telescopes. The observing epochs for IUE have been chosen to coincide with the EUVE Survey observing window, i.e. when the sources are 90 degrees from the solar direction. The six sources have been selected for their extremely low galactic neutral hydrogen column density and sufficient brightness in X-rays such that they should be detectable in the EUVE Lexan/Boron band, and 3 of them have been detected by the Wide Field Camera on ROSAT. These sources are variable on a time scale of days, so that it is essential to observe them with IUE once or preferably twice during the 5-10 day EUVE observing window.|Y
BLQFB|Multifrequency Observations and Variability of the BL Lacertae Objects, Mkn 421 and Mkn 501|Frederick|Bruhweiler|Catholic University|Simultaneous multifrequency observations spanning the entire electromagnetic spectrum from gamma-rays through radio waves are crucial to properly test models for the featureless BL Lacs. We are proposing to use the IUE as part of a rigorous multifrequency campaign to obtain two instantaneous flux distributions of the BL Lac objects, Mkn 421 and Mkn 501, separated by several months. Observations at ~2-3 days intervals, simultaneous with proposed EUVE observations, will monitor the nature of any short timescale variability. This study must be done, now, to take advantage of satellites sampling the spectrum from gamma-rays through the UV.  One of the most important CGRO results has been the discovery that blazars, including BL Lacs, are strong, variable gamma-ray sources. This, combined with the recent detection of ultra-high energy gammarays (10^12 eV) in Mkn 421 from the ground, presents a severe challenge to the relativistic beaming model for BL Lacs. Attempts to reconcile the gamma-ray spectrum of Mkn 421 with the relativistic beaming model require a large relativistic enhancement, in contrast with conclusions based upon previous simultaneous multifrequency observations at lower energies. This campaign, in which the IUE plays a fundamental role, will provide strong constraints for current theoretical models.|Y
BLRJW|Multifrequency Spectra of Blazars During Outbursts|James R.|Webb|Florida International University|We propose to obtain IUE spectra and simultaneous observations at radio, optical and gamma-ray frequencies during the critical stages of a Blazar outburst. This will be done by monitoring 17 blazars with dedicated ground-based optical instruments until a flare is detected in one of the them. This target of opportunity program would then be activated to obtain IUE observations over the duration of the outburst. Our other ToO programs (optical, IR, mm, gamma-ray) would also be activated to provide multifrequency coverage. Standard IUE AGN programs are not flexible enough to obtain critical outburst observations because flares are unpredictable and evolve on the order of days to weeks. This program can ONLY be done with IUE and it is an important part of a well organized multifrequency program that will result in simultaneous multifrequency spectra throughout the duration of an energetic outburst. A previous IUE program resulted in 10 nearly simultaneous multifrequency spectra of 3C 345 during an outburst and we used these observations to tightly constrain a theoretical jet + accretion disk model of 3C 345. We succeeded in studying the variability of the synchrotron component (jet) and the blue-bump component (disk) as the flare subsided (Webb et al 1994). We found a weak correlation between the power-law luminosity and the blue bump luminosity. We have added several experienced observers with more telescope time to our team which will allow us to obtain even better spectral and temporal coverage if one of our sources undergoes an outburst during the upcoming episode.|Y
BLRWH|Continuing Observations of the Jovian Aurora and UV Albedo|Walter M.|Harris|U Michigan|New IUE observations of Jupiter in the UV are proposed as part of a multifaceted program that exploits the unique capabilities of the lUE and the opportunity to compare with the large archive of existing spectra that goes back to the beginning of the 1980s. We pursue a four part program consisting of follow up observations in the wake of the Shoemaker-Levy encounter, detailed study of features identified in images of Jovian auroral emission with the FOC, coordinated observations of auroral emission with HST, and new observations of the equatorial Ly-alpha bulge. Follow up observations after the Shoemaker-Levy encounter are crucial to determining the extent and rate of change of any long term impact related effects for stratospheric chemistry, composition, or temperature. Several new features have been identified in FOC images of the aurora that are bright, localized, and separated from the auroral oval. We would observe these features with the IUE SWSA to determine how compare spectrally with what is seen in the more common SWLA spectra of these features and the auroral arc. We also would continue the program for simultaneous observations of the aurora with the FOC/WFPC-II. The addition of IUE spectra adds a much needed time and longitude coverage to the images, and also provides simultaneous observation of H2 and Ly-alpha emission, which is necessary for an analysis of the optical depth of the emission. Finally, we would observe the Ly-alpha bulge region in series with the auroral zone with the goal of detecting possible correlated brightening of these features.|Y

BNLWF|The Nature of Evolved Stars with Bipolar Nebulae|Walter A.|Feibelman|NASA/GSFC|We will obtain low dispersion spectra of 3 evolved stars with bipolar nebulae (representing a subgroup with common spectral and geometric characteristics) considered to be in a dynamic, short-lived transition to the planetary nebula stage. Only a small number of these objects are known and not more than 5 or 6 have been studied with the IUE. As evidenced by the attention lavished on them in recent IAU Symposia ( 103 and 131), it is clear that they form an important, but as yet poorly understood, link in the likely sequence of AGBOH/IR-PN evolution. Despite substantial reddening implied from visual spectra, current dust-torus models for these systems and our previous successful IUE observations indicate much lower reddening toward the central stars, bipolar nebulae, and possibly the inner regions of the tori. We have obtained successful observational results with IUE for M 1-92 and M2-9 and propose new observations for M 1-91, OH 0739-14, and Lick H-alpha 208.|Y
BNMHB|A Search for Binary Nuclei of Planetary Nebulae|Howard E.|Bond|STScI|About 15% of central stars of planetary nebulae are close binaries whose optical and UV radiation is dominated by the hot component that is also responsible for ionizing the nebula. The secondary stars in these systems are faint K-M dwarfs. The nebulae have most probably been ejected as a direct consequence of binary-star interactions.  The fraction of close binaries among all planetary nuclei could be even higher if there exists a significant number of pairs in which the optical radiation is dominated by the cool component (a G-K giant, or a B-F dwarf). In systems of this type, the hot components could be quite inconspicuous optically in spite of dominating in the UV. In fact, two such systems-the nuclei of Abell 35 and LoTr 5-have already been discovered with IUE. These two objects appear optically as G-type stars, and their orbital periods, although not yet known precisely, are most probably short.  It is proposed to continue a program of obtaining IUE spectra of candidate central stars of planetary nebulae for which ground-based observations indicate spectral types that are too cool to ionize the observed nebulae. In cases where hot companions are found, the IUE data will be used to provide effective temperatures and other stellar parameters; the results will also be used to identify objects for follow-up optical observations aimed at determining the orbital periods. The ultimate goal is to assess the relative importance of binary-star ejection as a mechanism for the production of planetary nebulae. Any case where a hot component is not discovered is also of interest, since it raises the possibility that the observed cool star is a planetary nucleus undergoing a shell flash that temporarily turns it into a red giant.  This program, which began during the 11th IUE year, has already revealed one spectacular new closebinary central star, that of LoTr 1. This system contains a rapidly rotating K-type star with strong chromospheric Mg II 2800 emission and an extremely hot (Teff > 100, 000 K) companion. Follow-up ground-based photometry indicates a period of 6.6 days.|Y
BPDJJ|Relationship Among B Type Peculiar Stars|Jun|Jugaku|Tokyo Astronomical Observatory|Comparative studies among three groups of peculiar B stars are proposed. Lines of Pt II and Hg II are to be searched in the high dispersion IUE spectra of Si stars and of helium-weak stars, and lines of rare earth elements are to be searched in Mn-Hg stars. Through these studies, new insights into the origin of CP stars are expected to be revealed.|Y
BPDKR|Observations of Four Hot Peculiar AP Stars|Karl D.|Rakos|Vienna|Stimulated by the discovery of stellar wind in the B9p star Alpha And, the high resolution spectra of three hot Bp stars HD 133029, HD 219749 and HD 175362 have been obtained in August 1979 during two 16 hours shifts with IUE satellite at Goddard Space Flight Center. IUE data reduction was carried out with the TololoVienna interactive image processing system. The resonance lines show very peculiar behaviour. Highly ionised atoms Si IV, C IV, N V and N IV are present showing strong absorption with extended blue wings and emission in the line cores. The emission features have velocities of expansion as high as 150 km/s. Much higher expansion velocity is connected with the broad absorption wings of this lines. The mass loss is also confirmed by the other resonance lines of Si III and Si II. The Si III 1206-510 line is strong and broad in HD 175362 with an extended blue wing and the maximum expansion velocity of 600 km/s. Also the resonance lines of Si II 1190.418 and 1193.284 in the spectrum of HD 175362 are remarkable. Stellar wind, extended atmosphere in rigid corotation with the stellar surface, within a distance of few star diameters, and the influence of the strong magnetic field on the upper part of the atmosphere is indicated. High speed spinning ions in the line of sight over the stellar surface, accelerated along the magnetic line of force by rigid corotation of the atmosphere, would explain broad symetric absorption in the wings of the resonance lines and the absence of such broad features for neutral atoms. The variations in the resonance lines are indicated. The magnetosphere of HD 175362, according to strong magnetic field of 33 KGauB et the poles and the inclination of the axis of the magnetic field by 870 to the axis of rotation, may have similar structure as the proposed magnetosphere of unusual stellar object SS 433. More observations of this stars should be carried out to establish any variations or nonsymetrical structure of the upper atmosphere.|Y
BPEJJ|Relationship Between Helium Anomalous Stars of Populations Iand II|Jun|Jugaku|University of Tokyo|We propose detailed comparative studies of chemical abundances between B-type peculiar stars of Populations I and II which show anomalously weak helium lines. High dispersion IUE spectra enable us to examine absorption lines of many elements which are not observable from the ground. Through analyses of Bp stars at different stages of evolution, we can expect to reveal new information as to the origin of chemically peculiar (CP) stars.|Y
BPNCG|IUE Observations of Mass Outflows in Beta Pictoris and A-Shell Stars|Carol A.|Grady|Catholic University|The coincidence of a circumstellar (CS) dust disk and infalling CS gas around 3 Pic has prompted suggestions that the infalling gas is the product of erosion of the dust disk. The inferred mass infall rate is commensurate with that predicted for the clearing phase of the proto-Solar System, and, if supported, would imply an early evolutionary state for the Beta Pic system. Recently, we have discovered sporadic mass outflows into the CS envelope from 6 Pic, indicating that some fraction of the infalling material is returning stellar ejecta. A determination of the amount of infalling material due to stellar activity is critical in evaluating the evolutionary state of the Beta Pic disk.  We propose a program of weekly IUE high dispersion observations of Beta Pic supplemented by higher time resolution (Delta t approximately 1 day) observations upon identification of an outflow episode and in coordination with the HST GHRS observation of O Pic scheduled for the Cycle 1 GTO program. These data will be used to establish the duration of outflow and infall episodes, and to estimate the amount of material involved in a single episode. These observations will be supplemented by observations of less well studied A shell stars resembling Beta Pic.|Y
BPOWF|A Study of Bipolar and Protoplanetary Nebulae|Walter A.|Feibelman|NASA/GSFC|We will obtain low dispersion spectra of the central stars of two IRAS sources, 07131-0147 and 18095+2704, one a bipolar and the other a protoplanetary nebula. If the extinction proves to be low towards 18095+2704, we will also obtain a high dispersion spectrum of this bright (V=10.4) object. These objects belong to a rare subgroup that are considered to be transitional objects between stars of the AGB and planetary nebulae. A small number of these objects are known and only three have been studied with IUE. Recent TAU Symposia (#103 and #131) have made clear that these objects form an important, but yet poorly understood, link in the likely sequence of AGB 4 OH/IR source 4 PN evolution. Despite their substantial reddening "implied" from visual emission line spectra, current dust torus models for these systems and our previous successful IUE observations for three of these objects indicate much lower reddening toward the central stars and possibly the bipolar nebulae.  The goals of our proposed IUE observations are: i.) to determine spectral characteristics of the central stars, ii.) to search for evidence of binarity, iii.) to search for nebular emission and use it to determine physical conditions in nebulae, gaining information about progenitor stellar masses, and iv.) to search for any ongoing mass loss activity.|Y
BSCJM|Observe the X-Ray Burst Source MXBL735-44|J. E.|McClintock|MIT|We request observing time to observe MXB1735-44, the optically brightest (V = 17.5) of the about ~25 known X-ray burst sources. It has a large ultraviolet excess (U-B approximately -0.8) and an optical spectrum which is very similar to that of Sco X-1. From IUE observations of MXB1735-44 and a subsequent comparison with existing IUE spectra of Sco X-1, we hope to obtain some answers to important questions concerning the X-ray bursters: Are they binaries? What are the physical properties of the region where reprocessing of X-rays into optical and ultraviolet photons occurs? How far does the similarity to Sco X-1 extend? The principal objective of this proposal is to measure the 1100-2100 A ultraviolet continuum flux of MXB1735-44. Reddening corrections will be determined using existing CTIO 4m plates and spectra and from low energy cutoff measurements to be obtained using the Objective Grating Spectrograph of the Einstein Observatory. Scaling from Sco X-1, we estimate that for MXB1735-44 the flux in each 50A band of the continuum will produce a approximage 5 sigma signal in 4 shifts or 32 hours of low background observations. This request is for a total of 2 low background observing shifts (16 hours). This is part of a joint project with Drs. J. van Paradijs and G. Hammerschlag of the University of Amsterdam who have submitted an identical request for 2 additional low background observing shifts to the European IUE Committee.|Y
BSHFB|Interstellar-Like C IV and SI IV in Late B Main Sequence Stars|Frederick C.|Bruhweiler|Catholic University|Nearby rapidly rotating B6-B9 main sequence stars show sharp C IV and Si IV features in their UV spectra. Because of their unusual sharpness, these features have been interpreted to be interstellar in origin. Yet, it is extremely difficult to account for such features in such short lines-ofsight toward stars with such low ionizing radiation. An alternate interpretation for these features could involve stellar mass loss. Both P Cygni and discrete shortward-shifted absorption denote observable mass loss in luminous O and B stars, and in subluminous hot stars. In the low luminosity boundary of mass loss in subluminous stars, the only hint of mass loss is the low velocity interstellar-like features of N V, C IV, and Si IV as seen in hot white dwarfs. The late-type B stars also seem to delineate the lower boundary of observable UV mass loss in luminous stars. If the mechanism for mass loss is similar for both young stars and highly evolved subluminous objects, perhaps the C IV and Si IV features in late B stars are a manifestation of stellar mass loss. We propose an archival study of main sequence BB-B9 stars, as well as stars of early A, to map out the occurrence of sharp-lined C IV and Si IV features and to determine their origin. Regardless of the interpretation, this study would have a pronounced impact on our current knowledge of both the interstellar medium and stellar mass loss.|Y
BSIGP|IUE, Voyager, and Visual Observations of B Supergiants|Geraldine J.|Peters|USC|To investigate a possible link between nonradial photospheric pulsations and variations in the circumstellar environment around B supergiants, we propose to observed eta CMa (B5 Ia) and other currently active members of this class of stars simultaneously with IUE, the Voyager UVS, and a ground-based Reticon array at ESO in Chile. We will look for correlations between changes in the photosphere and those in 1) the wind, 2) "narrow" components to the wind, or 3) circumstellar shell, and estimate radial locations of the line formation regions for the envelope features from phase delays. The program stars include, in addition to eta CMa, epsilon Ori (BO Ia), K Ori (BO-5 Ia) , O^2 CMa (B3 Ia), and Beta Ori (B8 Ia). While IUE high resolution observations will reveal variations in the circumstellar environment, combined Voyager + IUE low resolution data (900 - 3000A) will allow us to detect changes in the radiation field, which might affect the mass loss rate or ionization state of the envelope. Groundbased data will provide a model for the photosphere versus time (from Doppler imaging) and allow us to identify any nonradial modes which might be discerned. Since recent ground-based observations of the program stars suggest variability on time me scales slightly longer than a week, and we desire a time resolution of 1, we request twelve 4-hour US2 shifts to be scheduled every day for the duration of the observing run. In order to achieve simultaneous IUE and groundbased coverage, while all program stars are at favorable beta angles, we request scheduling for January 1987.|Y
BSJLG|Observations of Faint, High-Latitude Blue Stars|Jesse L.|Greenstein|CIT|Objective: To observe line and continuous spectra In the ultraviolet. Greenstein is interested and active in discovering new white dwarfs and in the white dwarf temperature scale.  Insofar as any new objects bright enough to be are found, he would be interested in adding some of these to the low resolution mode, essentially for spectrophotometry for temperature determination.|Y
BSNNE|Binaries in the Hertzsprung Gap?|Nancy Remage|Evans|York University - Canada|Studies of open clusters are as valuable in understanding binary star evolution as they are for single star evolution. The purpose of this proposal is to obtain IUE low dispersion observations of red giant binaries in 6 Hyades age clusters. The probablility of detecting companions is high because the stars have colors which are bluer than single red giants; in fact the composite colors place the systems in the Hertzsprung gap. From the ultraviolet spectra we will be able to determine accurate spectral types of the main sequence companions and hence we can infer temperatures and masses. Radial velocity studies by Mermilliod and Mayor provide orbital periods, separations, and eccentricities for the systems, In addition, comparison of the cluster color magnitude diagrams with isochrones provides a mass of the red giants (typically 2.3 M[sun]) The red giant mass, combined with the mass of the main sequence companions, provides the mass ratios. We stress that in this way, IUE provides a unique way to study the distribution of the mass ratios of single-lined spectroscopic binaries, which are relevant to such questions as the width of the main sequence, and binary formation mechanisms. The combined IUE plus ground-based data provide insight into the evolution of binary systems (circularization of orbits) and the dynamical evolution of clusters.  This study will provide two secondary products. The first is the detection of any peculiar objects such as FK Comae stars or contact binaries among the systems apparently in the Hertzsprung gap. Any such unusual objects would be important in determining the fate of short period binaries and whether they are linked to blue stragglers. The second product is an improved knowledge of the magnitudes of the red giants (through an improved correction for the companion) which will add to the Mermilliod-Mayor discussion of the structure of the red giant region.|Y
BSPDM|Long Term Variability of B Supergiant Winds|Derck L.|Massa|Applied Research Corporation|This proposal addresses an important, but not widely known phenomenon - long term time variations in the global nature of stellar wind flows in B supergiants. By this we mean changes in the nature of the wind lines which persist over time scales much longer than the "flushing time" of the winds and which are associated with wholesale changes in the nature of the wind line profile, considerably larger than those normally attributed to "narrow absorption components" (NACs). Consequently, these variations cannot be associated with inhomogeneities in the wind, but must be attributed to some form of photospheric activity. Very little is know about such variations and, until now, the presence of long term variability in normal B supergiant winds has not been studied. In this proposal, we will first demonstrate that such variability is quite common, and that it persists on time scales far longer than the flushing time of the wind. However, because the sampling of the observations to date has been effectively random, it is difficult to estimate the time scales involved. Nevertheless, we can show that the most probable time scale for the variability is the rotation period of the stars. Consequently, we are asking for 30 consecutive 1/2 US 2 shifts in order to follow 3 normal B supergiants through 2 full rotations.|Y
BVKGP|Multifrequency Observations of Rapid Variable Be-Shell Stars|Geraldine J.|Peters|USC|To investigate the cause for rapid variability (0.2-2 days) in Be stars and its effect on the mass loss in the star's equatorial plane, we propose simultaneous, IUE, Voyager, and ground based spectroscopic (Reticon), photometric, and polarimetric observations of 1 - 3 selected Be-shell stars. We will look for possible phase dependent variations in photospheric temperature, luminosity, projected surface area, and mass loss as well as asymmetry in the disk. These observations will allow us to discriminate between two different models offered to explain rapid variability: nonradial pulsations or starspots. To minimize data gaps which in the past have confused interpretation, we propose 40 continuous hours of repeated IUE observations (detailed above). The primary target is epsilon Cap; secondary targets are omicron Aqr and EW Lac.  Time resolved continuum observations spanning a decade in wavelength from Voyager (900-1700 A), low resolution IUE (1200-3000 A), and ground-based photometers (3000-9000 A) located at several sites worldwide will be used to directly obtain values for the cyclic change in temperature and luminosity and thus constrain models. High resolution IUE (SWP) observations will reveal any cyclic modulation of the wind or disk while Reticon data from telescopes in the United States, Europe, and Asia will provide information on photospheric activity such as nonradial pulsations and allow us to assess whether the rapid light variations are a result of such pulsations.|Y
BVOSC|The Correlation of UV Extinction and IR Emission in Bright Visual Reflection Nebulae|Sean C.|Casey|NASA/GSFC|Reflection nebulae are natural laboratories for the study of interstellar grains. To investigate the variation in ultraviolet extinction with infrared emission, we propose to obtain lowdispersion IUE observations of latetype B stars within several bright visual reflection nebulae. Our proposed observations will compliment existing data obtained previously by IUE for reflection nebulae excited by early-type B stars. In addition, our proposal compliments the earlier infrared studies of reflection nebulae (Sellgren, Luan, & Werner 1990, Casey 1991) by adopting a parametric decomposition of UV extinction (Fitzpatrick and Massa 1990). A parametric study of UV extinction and IR emission must necessarily precede a detailed analysis of optical nebular grain properties or dusty nebular environments. Recent models of interstellar grains predict systematic variations in UV extinction with variations in the abundance of very small grains (Desert, Boulanger, and Puget 1990) and/or variations in equilibrium grain temperature (Hecht 1986). A systematic study of nebular UV extinction and IR emission will test many of these predictions. If galactic extinction results from the superposition of distinct grain populations, then we expect to find correlated variations between observations of UV extinction and IR emission in bright visual reflection nebulae.|Y

BWRCG|Instabilities and Wind-Compressed Disk in B Star Winds|Carol A.|Grady|ARC|Time-series, greyscale pseudoimages of rapidly rotating, early-type B supergiants and Be stars have revealed systematic changes in the stellar wind components associated with high-density equatorial disks which develop on timescales of days to weeks. Variability on this timescale is unexpected and is inconsistent with low-density wind transit time phenomena, instabilities, stellar rotation, or pulsational activity. Recent optical studies of some Be stars have suggested that long-duration activity may reflect precession of spiral density waves in the circumstellar disk. The UV, with its abundance of spectral features providing wind and disk diagnostics, is a more suitable portion of the spectrum to test the density wave model. We propose utilizing the continued availability of the IUE to obtain observations of a limited set of these objects over a 30 day interval.|Y
BXPFW|Late B Star X-Ray Sources|Frederick M.|Walter|SUNY - Stony Brook|The most basic conclusion to be drawn from the EINSTEIN stellar X-ray observations was that all stars are X-ray sources - except the late-B and early- to mid-A stars. While this is still true in general, observations with the ROSAT X-ray observatory have shown that young late-B/early-A stars, those in and near regions of star formation, are often bright X-ray sources.  It is not yet clear why (or, indeed, whether) young B-A stars are often X-ray sources. We request time on the IUE to observe a sample of these stars. We will compare the line profiles against B star models against archival spectra, looking for evidence of mass loss or mass inflows, as well as evidence of transition region gas. Detection of the latter will prove that the B stars are indeed X-ray sources.|Y
BYEJL|Studies of Spots & Plages in by Draconis-Type Variable Stars|Jeffrey L.|Linsky|Colorado|The activity phenomena that are observed in BY Draconis stars closely resemble those observed in the Sun. Bright and dark spots have been inferred from their quasi-sinusoidal light variations. Also, powerful flare phenomena are occasionally observed in the radio, optical, UV and X-ray wavelength regions. The present proposal is aimed at studying in a more quantitative way the several activity phenomena observed with particular emphasis on the variability of chromospheric and transition region flux and their correlation with photospheric variability. These observations should provide comprehensive diagnostics, which are necessary in attempting to infer the physical conditions of the outer atmospheres of BY Dra stars in their quiescent and active phase. In order to reach this objective, we are proposing to observe with IUE some typical representatives of the group in the low and high dispersion mode with the SWP and the LWR camera, respectively. Coordinated ground-based coverage in the optical and radio bands, as well as soft X-ray observations with EXOSAT are planned. We plan to compute models of the chromospheres, transition regions, and coronae of these stars for the quiescent and active portions of their surfaces separately.|Y
BYNSS|Long-Term Variability of Magnetic Structures on BD +26 730|Steven H.|Saar|Harvard CFA - SAO|BD +26 730 , a rapidly rotating, BY Dra variable, is one of the most magnetically active K dwarfs known, and is the most active of the few stars with a known magnetic cycle period. The star is viewed nearly poleon; thus, almost all variability results from the evolution of activity in time, rather than rotational modulation. Direct measurement of the magnetic field strength and area coverage of plages on the star is possible. BD +26*730 thus presents a unique opportunity for observing long-term, purely temporal variability due to a magnetic cycle. IUE observations at two epochs already exist. We propose to continue monitoring the longterm variability of this star, now nearing starspot (and magnetic activity) maximum, with IUE in order to study the time-variability of the chromospheric and transition-region activity on long time-scales. Contemporaneous photometry, optical spectra, linear polarization, and magnetic line broadening measurements will be combined with the IUE data to explore the connections between photospheric magnetic fields, and the structure and energy balance of the hot, upper-atmospheric layers of the star. Comparison of the UV fluxes with earlier epoch IUE spectra, some taken near activity minimum, will allow us to investigate differences in stellar activity over the magnetic cycle of the star, yielding fundamental data on the behavior of stellar dynamos at high activity levels. Our study will be the first investigation of strictly temporal evolution of magnetic fields and related activity over the activity cycle on a star other than the Sun.|Y
BYOSS|Deep SWP Spectra of "Marginal" BY Dra Stars|Steven H.|Saar|Harvard CFA - SAO|Recent optical and UV surveys of M dwarfs have resulted in the discovery of a number of objects with intermediate activity levels (H-alpha in weak emission but strong Ca, II and UV emission). Available data suggest these stars have a level of chromospheric activity (and perhaps an evolutionary status) midway between active BY Dra/dMe stars and quiet dM's. These "marginal" BY Dra (mBY) stars provide us with a class of objects rotating very near a "trigger velocity" (about  5 km s^-1) which appears to divide active BY Dra stars from quiet dM's. Unfortunately, only poor far UV spectra have been obtained to date (<= 5 hours). We propose to take about 20 hour SWP spectra of two mBYs by combining an ESA shift with NASA US1 and US2 (first half). These new spectra will allow us to accurately probe the upper chromospheres and transition regions of these important transitional stars for the first time. Infrared magnetic field measures will be used to explore the connection between fieldstrength/filling-factor and atmospheric heating. Comparison of these data with published information on active dMe and quiet dM stars will yield information on the character of the stellar dynamo as it makes a transition from "high" to "low" activity.|Y
CAKTT|The Unusual Pulsating Variable XZ Ceti|Terry J.|Teays|CSC IUE|IUE time is requested to study the very peculiar pulsating variable XZ Ceti. This star has a period (0.82 days) which would suggest that it is an RR Lyr star pulsating in the fundamental mode (Bailey type ab) while its low amplitude and sinusoidal light curve would indicate that it is an overtone pulsator (Bailey type c). Teays and Simon have shown that XZ Cet is completely unlike RR Lyr stars of similar period, and suggested the possibility that it is an Anomalous Cepheid, which, if verified, would make it only the second one discovered in the Milky Way, and the first one bright enough for detailed study. Found in dwarf spheroidal galaxies and the SMC, Anomalous Cepheids do not obey the period-luminosity law, but are instead overluminous. It has been suggested that they result from mass exchange in a binary system and are possibly descendents of blue stragglers. Alternately, XZ Cet might be an overtone BL Her star, which would be the first one to be discovered.  This project will be part of a larger effort to study this star using ground-based spectroscopy. The UV continuum will be compared to the ground-based spectrum scans which the proposer has already obtained, and this will produce a more complete picture of the star's energy distribution, which will help to determine its temperature and effective gravity. This will help to clarify its evolutionary status.  In light of the observations of chromospheric activity in Delta Scuti and SX Phe stars, particular attention will be paid to the Mg II doublet, to look for any emission, as a function of pulsation phase.|Y

CAOSB|Chromospheric Activity in the Subgiant Branch|Suchitra C.|Balachandran|U North Carolina|Recent observations by Simon and Drake (1989) show that the activity in early-F stars declines once these stars leave the main sequence to become cool subgiants. This decline in activity together with the rapid disappearance of fast rotators in cool subgiants (Gray and Nagar 1985) favors dynamorelated braking. However, high levels of chromospheric activity have been found in a small number of redgiants. Detailed radial velocity studies have shown that at least some of them are single stars. The normal lithium abundances in these stars indicates the absence of extensive mixing which will result from binary coalescence. This suggests that either a) high levels of chromospheric activity persist in some stars through the subgiant phase or b) angular momentum is dredged up at the base of the redgiant branch in some giants leading to rapid surface rotation and high chromospheric activity. Both scenarios have important implications on the rotational braking models. I propose to measure the chromospheric activity in 10 F and 0 subgiants with B-V colors between 0.5 and 0.9 to determine if high levels of activity persist in the subgiant branch. This sample will double the existing data available in this region and help to provide constraints on the theoretical explanation for dynamo-related braking.|Y

CBBES|Ultraviolet Observations of Hot White Dwarfs in Binary Systems|Edward M.|Sion|Villanova|Seven binary systems containing hot white dwarfs are proposed for observation with the IUE telescope. Three of the systems (HD149499B, V471 Tau and LB3459), individually have unique astrophysical significance as important objects for IUE observation. The remaining four systems (CD -42 14462, BD-7 3007, BD -3 5357 and TT Ari) are nova-like systems which have considerable relevance to the evolutionary status of the cataclysmic variables in particular and to the late stages of binary star evolution in general.  The scientific merits of observing each system are discussed and our IUE experiment is outlined.|Y
CBBGM|Mass Flow & Evolution in Close Binaries Including Observations of X-Ray Binaries with Heao|George E.|McCluskey|Lehigh|We propose to use IUE to study mass flow in a selection of close binary systems with at least one massive component and to study the ultraviolet emission from a selection of close binaries which are also X-ray sources. We propose to investigate the dependence of mass flow on location in the system, on orbital phase angle and on orbital cycle in massive binaries at various stages of evolution thru the analysis of ultraviolet emission and absorption features associated with mass flow and stellar atmospheres. The possible correlation between ultraviolet and X-ray fluxes during high and low X-ray states is to be investigated. It is proposed that simultaneous observations with IUE and the X-ray satellites OSO 8 and HEAO 1, and with HEAO B in the future, be performed to determine possible relationships between ultraviolet and X-ray emission. This will enable, for example, an investigation of the effects of the impingement of X-rays onto the atmosphere of the optical companion.|Y
CBBRW|Binary Systems and Composite Sources Involving Cool and Hot Components|Robert F.|Wing|Ohio State University|There are several types of binary systems and stars exhibiting composite spectra in which components of very dissimilar temperature are present. In most of the cases considered, the cool component dominates in the visible spectral region and has already been studied extensively, while very little is known about the hot component which is expected to dominate in the ultraviolet. Observations with the International Ultraviolet Explorer satellite will tell us what kinds of hot stars can be found in binary systems with enormous red giant and supergiant primaries -- and in some cases will provide the first clear evidence whether a hot star is actually present or not. Spectral classifications of the hot stars will be done with low-resolution observations and will be useful in determining the absolute magnitudes of the cool components. A few of the systems with relatively bright early-type components will also be observed at high resolution to look for spectroscopic evidence of interaction between the two components, and some stars with bright emission-line spectra will be studied at high resolution in order to determine the physical conditions in the nebular gas.|Y
CBCAD|Atmospheric Structure and Mass Motions in LAte-Type Binary Systems|Andrea K.|Dupree|CFA|We have observed hybrid atmospheres in G supergiants with IUE (Hartmann et al. 1979), showing both high-temperature (N V, C IV) and low-temperature (Fe II, S I) ions. These stars show cool Mg II circumstellar shells at velocities about -100 km s^-1 relative to the photosphere, a velocity intermediate between the solar wind and typical cold supergiant winds about10 km s^-1. The study of such hybrid chromosphere-wind stars is crucial to understanding the mechanism of mass loss in late-type stars. Accordingly, our proposed observations focus on detecting the presence of hot gas and studying the dynamics of the wind. We propose: 1) a few new observations searching for possible correlated wind and chromospheric variability; 2)long-exposure high-dispersion observations of 0I and possibly other ions in order to determine velocity shifts, a prospect made easier by the relatively high shell velocity shifts in these stars relative to later supergiants; 3) observations to connect Mg II asymmetries with outflows detected in 0I; and 4) a high-sensitivity search for hot gas in stars with circumstellar shells at moderate velocities (about -50 km s^-1.)|Y
CBCGM|Observations of Gas Streaming in Interacting Semi-Detached Binary Systems|George E.|McCluskey|Lehigh University|We propose to use the IUE to study the motion of gas streams in a selection of close binary systems consisting of a late B-type or an early A-type component and a later type sub-giant or giant losing mass via its Roche Lobe. These systems are quite similar to U Cep which we have already observed with the IUE. Our IUE observations of U Cep have enabled gas stream motion in the system to be followed in some detail and clearly showed that the mass flow is non-conservative. Ground-based date on the binaries which we propose to observe strongly indicate that they are excellent candidates for gas stream mapping using the resonance lines of Fe II and Mg II in the mid-ultraviolet and the lines of Si III, Si IV, C II and C IV, among others, in the farultraviolet. A minimum of four observations of each system made near phases 0.00, 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75 will provide a basic framework for mapping the gas stream(s).|Y
CBCGP|High Resolution UV Observations of Algol Type Interacting Binary Systems|Geraldine J|Peters|USC|An observing program is proposed to obtain phase dependent high resolution ultraviolet spectroscopic observations of Algol type interacting binary stars in order to determine temperatures, densities, rates of mass flow, and structure of the circumstellar matter in these systems.  Each binary system in the program should be observed a minimum of three times with both long and short wavelength (high dispersion) cameras on IUE in order to achieve adequate phase and wavelength coverage. We request observations to be schedulebetween 0.8 < phi < 1.0 to study the nature of the gas streams in the systems, between 0.45 < phi < 0.65 to determine the extent of the mass loss from the systems near superior conjunction, and between 0.1 < phi < 0.45 to observe the primaries when there is a minimum of additional material along our line of sight.  We also wish to look for the presence of phase dependent stellar winds.  In order to investigate the extent to which the nature of the circumstellar material depends upon the mass ratio and period of the system, we have carefully chosen two short period (P < 5^d) systems, three intermediate period (5^d <  P < 15^d) systems, and four long period (P> 15^d systems for this study. Based upon our recent ground based and/or Copernicus UV observations, each system is active and displays phase dependent spectral variations.|Y
CBCMP|Accretion in Binary Stars|Mirek|Plavec|UCLA|I propose to study the accretion process in interacting close binary systems of long period. R.H. Koch and myself have discovered, with the IUE, seven systems displaying prominent emission lines of highly ionized elements (N V, C IV, Si IV, etc.). These systems are probably in the rapid phase of mass transfer, with a mass transfer rate on order of 10 5 M(sun)/year or higher. Our observations revealed a complex structure of the accreting star. The star itself, which may be at the limit of rotational stability, is surrounded by a hot transition zone, by a disk in the orbital plane, and possibly by a rarefied extended envelope not restricted to the orbital plane. Observations of these complex accretion structures are vital for our understanding of mass transfer and accretion in close binary stars, and it appears that IUE provides far more information than any other observational technique or instrument.  A total of 40 hours of the IUE observing time will provide excellent data needed to supplement and extend the existing material, while 16 hours will still make the project feasible. I would like to study: (1) The profiles of the emission lines using the high-dispersion mode, in order to see if they are indeed formed in a stellar wind, as we found to be the case for Beta Lyrae. (2) The absorption lines in the underlying continuum, again using the high dispersion mode on selected stars. The absorption spectrum is unlike the spectra of standard stars, and is probably a peculiar shell spectrum. Items (1) and (2) do not require special timing. (3) I would like to observe at least one secondary minimum for one of the seven stars, in order to decide if the emission lines are associated with the cooler object. This is a fundamentally important observation. (4) Low dispersion scans through one or two primary eclipses will provide time- and space-resolved data on the structure of the accreting complex. All these observations will be supplemented by simultaneous spectral scans at the Lick Observatory, so that a complete energy distribution will be obtained over the region 1100 - 7000 A, without a significant gap.|Y
CBCRK|UV Spectroscopy of Nondegenerate and Degenerate Close Binaries with Circumstellar Gas|Robert H.|Koch|Pennsylvania|This program is conceived in order to observe examples of three subsets of close binaries: (1) very hot and slightly evolved systems showing abundant shell structure and strong winds; (2) highly evolved pairs containing a hot component embedded in a hot disk and a cool component (perhaps with a highly-developed chromosphere and corona) feeding the hot disk by streaming gas; and (3) novae during quiescent intervals when the disk and hot spot structure are still building toward outburst. The spectra are to be studied in order to quantify the gas volume dimensions and motions and the atmospheric characteristics of the component star(s).|Y
CBCRW|Synoptic Observations of Zeta Aurigae Systems|Robert F.|Wing|Ohio State University|The Zeta Aurigae stars are eclipsing binaries involving a late-type supergiant and an early-type dwarf. Previous UV work performed with the IUE satellite has shown that an abundance of information concerning the circumstellar wind and environs of these systems can be obtained, even well out of eclipse (cf. Stencel et al. 1979, Ap.J. Oct. 15). Continued monitoring of these systems is important at this time since their binary orbital periods, which range from 3 to 20 years, are long compared to the probable remaining time of IUE operation. Therefore, now is the time to obtain outside-eclipse data which improve the geometric perception of the Interacting stellar winds and material flows within and out of the system, so that the complex data obtained during the brief eclipses can be used more effectively.|Y
CBCSH|Mass-Loss in O-Type Binaries|Sara R.|Heap|NASA/GSFC|I propose to continue the previous program, "Binary Stars Having O-Type Spectra (BCSRH)". The new program, however, will concentrate on a study of the stellar-wind lines, in an effort to answer the following questions: (1) Do O-type binaries lose mass at a faster rate than do spectroscopically similar, single O-type stars? (2) Does the rate of mass-loss vary with phase, particularily for binaries with eccentric orbits? (3) How do the relative rates of mass-loss (M/M) of young O stars and old, subluminous O stars compare? (4) What are the characteristics of mass-loss for binaries of well-known physical parameters (mass, gravity, temperature)? These-questions, discussed in detail (see e.g. J. Ziolkowski, in Mass-Loss and Evolution of O-Type Stars, D. Reidel, 1979), are amenable to solution with the help of IUE spectrophotometry of the wind lines particularly N V 1240, O IV 1340, O V 1370, Si IV 1400, C IV 1550, and N IV 1718.|Y
CBDDL|Peculiar Red Giants: A Search For White Dwarf Companions|David L.|Lambert|Texas|The carbon and s-process element abundances in the atmosphere of a red giant are not predicted to be enhanced until the star is in a thermally pulsing double shell burning phase, that is, the red giant has become cool and highly luminous. The classical Barium (and other peculiar giants) which are warm and not highly luminous do not fit this prediction. Special conditions (e.g. anomalous mixing events at the time of the He-core flash) in a small fraction of red giants have been invoked to explain these low luminosity peculiar giants.  The recent discovery by McClure and collaborators that some, possibly all, classical Ba II giants are binaries with low mass companions provides a new explanation for the composition anomalies. it is possible that mass from a thermally pulsing primary was transferred to the secondary which we now detect as the red giant. The primary may remain as a white dwarf (or neutron star). Indeed, IUE spectra of the Ba II star Zeta Cap indicates a white dwarf companion (Bohm-Vitense 1980).  We propose to search for the ultraviolet continuum of a WD companion to the classical R (hot carbon) stars, additional Ba II stars, and the CH or Population II Ba II stars in order to test the hypothesis that the low-luminosity peculiar red giants of types equivalent to G and K result from mass transfer.|Y
CBDEB|Search for White Dwarf Companions of Stars with Peculiar Process & CNO Abundances|Erika|Bohm-Vitense|Washington|We would like to continue our search for white dwarf companions of Ba, CH strong, CH weak and CN strong stars.  The Ba II star zeta Cap was observed to have a white dwarf companion. The weak Ba II star zeta Cyg appears to have a somewhat cooler WD companion. HD 65699 (BA II) and HR 2392 (Ba II) also show indications of companions but additional long exposures have to be taken to verify this.  If mass exchange between binaries is responsible for the visibility of the excess s process elements we may speculate that mass exchange might also be responsible for the CH and CN peculiarities.  We would also like to obtain and study a high resolution short wavelength spectrum of the Barium star zeta Cap which was observed to have a hot white dwarf companion, The emission line profiles will probably tell us the origin of these strong emission lines and give us information about circumstellar material which is probably present as judged from the strong central reversals in the Mg II emission lines.  At the same time the chromospheric and transition layer emissions of these peculiar abundance stars will be studied. Peculiar CNO abundances might be verified by their chromospheric and transition layer line intensities as compared to normal stars|Y
CBDFF|Mass Determination Of Evolved & Early Type Stars|Francis C.|Fekel|NAS/GSFC|A number of single-lined spectroscopic binaries have secondaries of earlier spectral type indicated by large mass functions or composite spectral types. Accurate radial velocity measurements of the early-type  De components are extremely difficult at optical wavelengths because of the strong flux and numerous lines of the later type primary. In the ultraviolet it is possible to obtain velocities of the early-type star with uncertainties as small as 2-5 km s^-1 . These velocities combined with the known orbital elements of the Primary and an inclination derived from eclipses or speckle interferometry will permit determination of the individual masses of a number of giant, supergiant, and early type stars. This will substantially increase our knowledge of this basic datum for these types of stars and permit a comparison with theoretical models of evolution.|Y
CBDJE|Chromospheric Emission of W Ursae Majoris Stars|Joel|Eaton|Vanderbilt University|The role of surface activity in determining the nature of the light curves of W Ursae Majoris stars is as yet uncertain. Certain lines of reasoning suggest that it may be crucial for at least the convective W-type systems. This program will attempt to determine just bow strong surface activity is in W UMa systems by observing the far-ultraviolet chromospheric line emission of a characteristic group of these objects.|Y
CBDJL|An Attempt to Detect a Hot Degenerate Companion to the Dwarf Carbon Star G77-61|James W.|Liebert|Arizona University|G77-61 is unique among low luminosity parallax dwarf stars in having a strong carbon-star spectrum. The most plausible cause of the unusual abundances seems to be mass transfer from a more massive companion which previously passed through a giant carbonstar phase. However, it is important to demonstrate that this explanation is correct. We have found that G77-61 has enhanced optical ultraviolet (U) flux relative to giant carbon stars of similar temperature. While suitable model analyses do not exist, recent research indicates that the ultraviolet deficiency normally seen in giant carbon stars is due to C3 molecular opacity (not SiC(2)), and C(3) ought to form more easily in the dwarf atmosphere. Hence, we propose that a hot, degenerate companion may account for the extra ultraviolet flux. We calculate that the companion should have a temperature of about 8,000 K, and should be unambiguously measurable in the LWR camera for a first shift exposure time exceeding 7 hours.|Y
CBDMP|Interacting Close Binary Stars of Longer Period|Mirek J.|Plavec|UCLA|I propose to continue observations of selected close binaries transferring mass in mode B. My primary targets are interacting binaries of the W Ser (or beta Lyr) type, which display strong emission lines and peculiar continua in the M. By observing their eclipses, and by studying several brighter related objects at high dispersion, I want to illuminate the nature and origin of the emission lines. Attempts will be made to match the continua by disk and hydrogen cloud models developed at UCLA; certain additional observations are needed for this purpose.  I propose to study mu Sgr, in which we discovered a hot component, and use its suspected atmospheric eclipses to study the stellar wind complex of the B8 Ia supergiant primary. Eclipse observations are planned to determine the characteristics of the components of selected Algols.|Y
CBDSS|Luminous, Extended Atmosphere Stars in the Magellanic Clouds|Steven N.|Shore|Case Western Reserve University|This proposal aims at investigating a group of related LMC and SMC supergiants, which show similar emission line characteristics. The group includes several Hubble-Sandage variable analogs, which show [FeII] emission, and several with HeII and [NII] as well as [OIII] emission. A comparison between the LMC and SMC stars with otherwise identical optical spectra will provide new information about the acceleration mechanism for stellar winds. All of these stars have optical material which we have been analyzing in detail, so that the ultraviolet observations will be directly linked to the optical characteristics of these stars.|Y
CBDTM|Observations of Theta 1 B Orionis Using IUE|T.|Matilsky|Rutgers University|Theta1B Orionis (= BM Orionis) is shown to be highly unusual, from previous IUE observations. A detailed study of the object is 6^d.5 proposed, consisting of observations throughout the 6^d.5 binary period, with special attention given to the eclipse phases.|Y
CBEAC|UV Observations of the Symbiotic Star AR PAV in Eclipse & Two Mass-Transfer X-Ray Binaries|Anne P.|Cowley|Michagan|Previous IUE observations of the eclipse egress of the symbiotic binary AR Pav show that the hot secondary and high excitation emission line region are not eclipsed during the optical totality. Further uv observations nearer the center of eclipse are required to determine the distribution, structure and physical conditions of the disk surrounding the hot star. UV observations of two unusual xray sources with high mass-transfer rates will also be obtained to investigate variations on the time scales of a few days to a few weeks.|Y
CBEAD|High Resolution Study of Epsilon Coronae Austrinae|Andrea K.|Dupree|CFA|We have discovered the heretofore undetected secondary star In the evolved W UMa-type system, epsilon CrA through Its chromospheric emission In Mg II. A high dispersion short wavelength spectrum Is feasible and can reveal the apparently different high temperature structure for the two components that Is suggested by our light curves. Differences would have consequences for common convective envelope theories. An evolved system such as this can be the connecting link between the dwarf stars with high temperature coronae, and more luminous evolved stars with warm atmospheres and winds.|Y
CBECW|Ultraviolet Observations of the Old Nova RR Pictoris|Chi-Chao|Wu|CSC|We propose to obtain IUE low dispersion spectra at several important phases for the 3.5-hour period old nova RR Pic. since the distance to RR Pic (480 pc) is known, the above spectra will allow us to compute well constrainted models which will give the temperature structure, luminosity and size of the hot spot and the accretion disk; and the mass accretion rate of the system. We also plan to take one short wavelength spectrum of RR Pic through the small aperture. This will allow the broad at absorption from the white dwarf to be measured, if it is present. The depth of Lyman-alpha is an indication of the contribution of the white dwarf to the UV flux at ~1220 A. This contribution must be excluded before fitting the accretion disk models. The RR Pic results will be compared with those of U Gem (Wu et al. 1981). RR Pic has an absolute magnitude of M v =+4 while U Gem has M v =+10. This large deviation in luminosity may be due to differences in the white dwarf primaries or mass accretion rates, or both. Our investigation will provide observational evidence on the fundamental differences between novae and dwarf novae systems.|Y
CBEDL|The Primary Component of Algol Systems of Low Mass Ratio|David L.|Lambert|Texas|High dispersion spectra between 1300 and 1800 A are to be obtained for the primary component of low mass-ratio Algol systems. The spectra will yield the chemical abundance of carbon, nitrogen, boron, and other elements. It is predicted that nuclear processed material from inside the secondary and transferred to the primary will have produced abundance anomalies on the primary. In conjunction with ground-based spectroscopy, definition of these anomalies and a comparison with theoretical predictions is the primary goal of the program.|Y
CBEEO|Target of Opportunity Observations of U Cephei in Active Mass Transfer|Edward C.|Olson|Illinois|We propose to obtain high-dispersion observations of the Algol eclipsing binary U Cephei during a transient phase of active mass transfer, as detected and verified by ground-based observations. While there are several IUE programs studying Algols, none has been proposed to concentrate on the kind of eruptive mass-transfer events known to occur in U Cephei. The main questions to be considered in this program are: (1) why is a prominent light loss seen outside primary eclipse during active mass transfer/accretion events; and (2) does the systemic mass loss increase during such events? Both questions relate directly to the mechanisms of was flow and accretion, and to the evolution of angular momentum in this active close binary system.|Y
CBEJE|Follow-On OBS of W Ursae Majoris Stars|Joel A.|Eaton|Vanderbilt|Recent ultraviolet observations have shown that chromospheric and transitionregion emission, which is roughly directly proportional to total radiative luminosity, is produced by practically all the W UMa binaries. This emission extends to earlier spectral type than it does for single stars. Further observations are needed to investigate the cutoff of this activity at early spectral type and to provide a better comparison between the binaries of spectral type A-F and those of type G-K. Other observations are needed to give ultraviolet (2000-3000K) light curves to be used to investigate the surface brightness distributions of both early and late-type W UMa binaries. These observations will provide the means to determine the gravity darkening and temperature difference between the components of several more systems in the way Eaton, Wu, and Rucinski did recently for W UMa with ANS data.|Y
CBEJL|High Dispersion SWP Observations of Two Late-Type Binaries|Jeffrey L.|Linsky|Colorado|High dispersion far UV exposures of 15-18 hours duration are proposed for the analysis of two late type binaries: Alpha Her (M5 II + G5 III) and Zeta Cap (G5 II Ba-2 + wd). Analysis of the far UV emission line fluxes and profiles will enable us to derive properties of the cool star outer atmospheres. The properties of the circumstellar material will be inferred from the blue-shifted resonance lines seen in absorption against the continuum of the hot secondary star. Alpha Her is an excellent candidate for studying mass loss and interaction between a strong stellar wind from the M5 II star and the G5 III star corona; while Zeta Cap, the prototype Ba II star, is an excellent system for the analysis of the interaction between a cool giant enriched with sprocess material and its white dwarf companion.|Y
CBEJS|An Initial Ultraviolet Investigation of Rapidly Evolving Short Period Eclipsing Binaries|J. Scott|Shaw|Georgia|A new class of short period, strongly interacting eclipsing binary systems undergoing rapid mass exchange and/or mass loss has been recently identified by one of us (JSS). This group of close binary systems is akin to W UMa-type systems but has somewhat longer orbital periods and components of very dissimilar temperatures. The systems SW Lyn, V1010 Oph, and RT Scl are the best known members of this class of binaries. These Systems appear to be in an early stage of case A binary evolution prior to becoming contact systems in which the more massive hotter (A to F) component is close to or at its Roche limiting surface. Analyses of their asymmetric light curves and period changes indicate substantial mass exchange and/or mass loss. Present groundbased spectra show variable asymmetric line profiles. The photometric studies indicate that the observed asymmetries in the light curves can be explained by the presence of a bright shock region ("hot spot") produced on the receding hemisphere of the cooler component, by the impact of a gas stream from the more massive component. In this initial UV study we propose to observe a small, but representative sample of these stars with the IUE satellite in the wavelength region 1175-3200 using the SWP and LWR cameras. Low dispersion SWP and LWR spectra will be taken during eclipses and at elongations to allow us to identify and map out gas flows and the interacting plasmas using resonance lines of Fe II and Mg II h and k in the near UV and lines such as CIII, CIV, NIV, NV, and SiIII and SiIV in the far UV. High dispersion UV spectra of the brightest member of the class, V1010 Oph, will be obtained for a detailed investigation of the velocities of the expected gas streaming as well as the thermal and mass flow properties of the interacting plasmas. We plan to obtain ground-based spectroscopic and photometric observations of V1010 Oph at or near the time the UV observations are made.|Y
CBENM|Stellar Winds in Two Massive Binary Stars with Known Orbits|Nancy D.|Morrison|Toledo|Y Cygni and TU Muscae are massive eclipsing binaries with uncomplicated light curves and relatively well-determined orbits. We propose to obtain good orbital phase coverage of both, in order to study the P Cygni profiles of resonance lines and their variation with orbital phase. Our analysis will seek to determine the ionization balance in the stellar wind as a function of position in the orbital plane and to identify structures such as gas streams and colliding winds.  Since there are woefully few massive binary systems in which the masses of the components can potentially be well determined, it is important to study such systems carefully. While several complicated systems have been well observed with IUE, the simpler, better understood systems have received less attention. Y Cygni is a well-studied, detached system, and TU Muscae is a contact system; both are known or expected to show evidence of mass loss. Comparison of the spectra of more complicated systems with the spectra of these objects will indicate which features in the complicated systems are peculiar to them and which are common to all massive binaries.|Y
CBEPS|A Study of the Variability of 2A0526-328|Paula|Szkody|Washington|2AO526-328 is a cataclysmic variable with known 5.2 hour and 4 day optical variations. Preliminary IUE spectra have showed the existence of a steady state disk at lamba <2100A and a hot spot (T~10,000K) at lambda >2100A. IUE observations of the orbital cycle throughout 4 days will be used to determine the disk and spot characteristics as related to current time dependent models of mass accretion. The importance of this system is that the mass accretion timescale is known and may be easily covered. The results from this system can then be applied to other cataclysmics to understand their outburst and high/low state phenomena.|Y
CBESP|Mass Ratios of Binaries with Cool Primaries & Hot Secondaries|Sidney B.|Parsons|NASA/GSFC|It is proposed to observe single-lined spectroscopic binaries containing F or G giant or supergiant primaries and hot (B or early A secondaries. Very little mass information has been available for luminous F and G stars from ground-based work. High dispersion LWR spectra, by cross-correlation with appropriate standard star spectra, will yield the relative radial velocities of the components with an accuracy of around 3 km/s. From the known velocity behavior of the primary, a mass ratio can be obtained. From the temperature of the secondary, obtained from the ultraviolet fluxes, a main sequence mass can be reliably estimated. The mass of the primary will then be measured with greater precision than by any other technique such as spectroscopic surface gravities. Thus greater knowledge of the evolution of these binary systems will be attained.|Y
CBFAH|High Resolution Spectroscopy of White Dwarf Accreting Systems|Albert V.|Holm|CSC|We propose to obtain long (15 hour) high resolution spectra of V603 Aquilae, omicron Ceti B, SS Cygni, and V471 Tauri to: 1) identify unambiguously the line features and to locate regions of continuum.  2) search for absorption features indicating the presence of a circumstellar shell or a wind originating from these accretion disks, and 3) study the variation in line profiles as a function of excitation potential to produce a mapping of the physical characteristics in the disk.  The accreting gas and hot component in these mass exchanging systems is best studied in the ultraviolet because in the visual and infrared the cool, masslosing component is usually the dominant light source. The systems targeted in this proposal are among the brightest of their class and these high resolution studies will serve as prototypes until the Space Telescope is available to extend this resolution to fainter sources.  Our observations will be made while these systems are in a quiescent phase to avoid complications introduced by a highly variable accretion rate and to test the Guinan and Sion hypothesis that mass loss from accreting systems is determined by luminosity.|Y
CBFBH|Identification of Active Regions on the Eclipsing Binary Flare Star Pair YY Gem|B. M.|Haisch|Lockheed|The eclipsing spectroscopic binary TY Cam is unique sand extremely interesting because both stars are identical dMle flare-active stars in a circular, short period (19.6 hr) orbit. Both stars are synchronously rotating; extended starspot regions, plage regions and regions of flare activity have previously been identified and napped out. Both stars are bright X-ray and 6 cm radio sources. We propose to Investigate the geometrical distribution of active regions on the stellar surfaces by taking a series of long and short wavelength IUE low dispersion spectra covering about 50% of just over three orbital periods; we will especially concentrate on taking spectra during tines of eclipse. In addition, the chromospheric and transition region fluxes will be compared to other dM and dMe stars to further toot the rotation-activity connection. Differential emission measure analysis will be used to compare active region properties to solar plage emission and to loop models. Intercomparisons will be made to photospheric variability (from simultaneous ground-based photometry and spectrophotometry) and to coronal variability (from simultaneous VLA observations of 6 cm gyroresonance emission).|Y
CBFMP|Interacting Binary Stars of the W Serpentis Type|Mirek J.|Plavec|UCLA|We propose to investigate the processes of mass transfer, accretion, and mass loss in interacting non-degenerate binaries by studying the W Serpentis phenomenon (as defined in Dl) by means of the following observations: (1) Use two US2 shifts to make two runs through the primary eclipse of U Cephei in order to study the structure and parameters of the line-emitting region; (2) Use one US2 shift to make a similar run through the primary eclipse of U Sagittae, for the same purpose, to study evolutionary differences; (3) Use 2-3 hrs segments of four different US2 shifts to observe beta Lyrae at two eclipses and two other phases, in order (a) to study the emission line profiles, (b) to determine the continuous flux distribution of the components; (4) Use the rest of the above-mentioned four US2 shifts, one full US2 shift, and one US1 shift, to observe: (a) Total eclipses of several Algols in order to detect the W-Ser type emission lines; (b) Emission line profiles in KX And and absorption-line profiles in several bright Algols.  Observations sub (1), (2), (3a), and (4b) are vital for the PhD. thesis of Janet Weiland; observations sub (3b) and (4b) are vital for the PhD. thesis of Jan Dobias.|Y
CBFPS|A Study of 4 New Am Her Variables|Paula|Szkody|Washington|Short and long wavelength IUE spectra of four recently discovered AM Her type cataclysmic variables will be obtained in order to expand the implications of radial accretion onto magnetic white dwarfs. This includes comparison of the observed UV fluxes with models to determine the magnetic field strength of the white dwarf and the accretion rate, determination of the presence of a black body component that could be related to nuclear burning on the surface of the white dwarf and the determination of the flux distribution of the accretion column and surrounding areas on the white dwarf.  These 4 objects will double the available data on systems of this type and set a range for the "normal" conditions surrounding magnetic accretion that can be compared to lower magnetic field situations where the accretion is from a disk - i.e. the usual dwarf novae and novalike systems.|Y
CBGEB|Dynamical Masses for Population I and Population II Cepheids|Erika|Bohm-Vitense|Washington|We would like to obtain additional LWR 1) high resolution spectra of Pop I Cepheid binaries in order to determine the orbital velocities of the companions. (Actually, the velocity difference between Cepheid and companion). The velocities of the Cepheids are known from ground-based observation. The ratio of the velocities and thereby the mass ratio of the stars can then be determined. The spectral type of the companion is determined from the measured SWP spectrum energy distribution and yields the mass of the companion. The mass of the Cepheid can thereby be found. We can thereby check pulsational and evolutionary masses.  We would like to extend our observations to the peculiar Pop II binary Cepheid AU Peg, whose orbital elements have recently been determined.|Y
CBGEG|Vertical Atmospheric Structure of the K-Dwarf Component of the Eclipsing Binary V471 Tauri|Edward F.|Guinan|Villanova|We propose to use the IUE to investigate the vertical structure in the atmosphere of the chromospherically active K2V component of the Hyades eclipsing binary V471 Tauri. This eclipsing binary provides a unique opportunity to study the atmospheric structure and also to probe the scale height of possible inhomogeneities present in the atmosphere of the K2V by using the white dwarf as a beaming probe of its atmosphere. In V471 Tauri the atmospheric spectrum of the cool star will be seen in absorption against the nearly featureless continuum of the white dwarf as it moves behind the cool star preceeding and following the total occultation eclipse which lasts about 50 minutes. IUE observations made by us of the system during 1979/80 suggested the presence of chromospheric and transition region absorption lines such as OIA1300 and CIV 1500 shortly before and after primary eclipse (i.e. when the white dwarf was near the limb of the K star). Since these features were not observed again at other orbital phases, it is unlikely that they originated from the white dwarf. It is possible that the CIV feature arose as the radiation from white dwarf was absorbed by a magnetically confined "loop" structure in the atmosphere of the cool star. In this proposal we wish to test this hypothesis bv intensely observing the star when the white dwarf is near the limb of the cool star.|Y
CBGJE|Non-Radiative Heating in Stellar Atmospheres: A-Type W UMA Binaries|Joel A.|Eaton|Indiana University|All of the W UMa binary systems now seem to be extremely strong sources of chromospheric and transition-region emission. This is a proposal to study how non-radiative heating affects the atmospheric structure and common envelope of the hotter A-type W UMa systems. Ultraviolet and optical light curves for the F2 V system V566 Oph will be solved to determine the degree of gravity darkening and the wavelength dependence of limb darkening in the star's atmsophere. Combined with the predictions of atmospheric models, the observed wavelength dependence of limb darkening will provide a measurement of how much the source function in the upper photosphere has been modified by surface activity. V566 Oph has been chosen for this work because it has a relatively uncomplicated light curve, and because it will be possible to make ground-based observations of V566 Oph at Indiana University.|Y
CBGMP|Circumstellar Emission Regions in Algols|Mirek J.|Plavec|UCLA|I propose to exploit the discovery of the circumstellar hot turbulent shell surrounding the gainers in some of the semidetached binaries of the Algol type (henceforth briefly the Algols.) This shell radiates in emission lines of fairly high ionization (ref. 1, 2, 3), but can also be observed in absorption when highdispersion IUE spectra are used (ref. 3; Peters and Polidan, preprint). The high temperature (60,000 - 120,000 K) and turbulent character of the shell suggest that it takes its energy from the accretion process. Its large extent and the P Cygni character of the emissions (seen in high-dispersion spectra) indicate mass outflow from the system. The shell is present in all W Serpentis stars (ref. 7) and has been detected in about six "classical" Algols.  What is the importance of the shell? (1) It is an important part of the mass transfer/accretion/mass loss process. (2) From the relative line intensities, we can study the C/N abundance ratio and determine the extent to which the material was subject to CNO-processing in the core of the loser.  I propose to observe selected Algol systems in primary eclipses in order to detect the shell and derive its physical properties and chemical abundances. An attempt will be made to find a correlation between the presence, extent, and characteristics of the shell and the system parameters. Low-dispersion SWP spectra of the selected systems in eclipses can be obtained in US2 shifts.  An analysis of the profiles of the absorption lines formed in the shell is possible for a few of the selected systems if high-dispersion SWP spectra are obtained; these require one US1 shift.|Y
CBGNE|Frequency of Multiple Systems Among Cepheid Binaries: Implications For Star Formation|Nancy Remage|Evans|CSC|This is a proposal to test a sample of binary cepheids for multiplicity by searching for short period radial velocity variations of their hot companions. It is largely based on archival high dispersion observations for 6 stars. Observations are also requested for S Sge to increase the sample, and for T Mon in a separate proposal. With this sample we will be able to determine the fraction of binaries which are multiple and also to derive a lower limit to the mass ratio of the cepheid to the spectroscopic binary (M single/MSB). This last ratio provides basic data about the fragmentation process. Currently all cases listed by Fekel (1981), (referred to as Fekel hereafter) have M sin/M SB < 1, i.e., apparently it is always the larger mass which fragments in hierarchical fragmentation. However selection effects work against detection of systems for which M sin/M SB > I in the visual region. S Sge and T Mon are systems for which M sin/M SB may well be greater than one, and hence are good tests of whether the common pattern is universal.|Y
CBGRP|A Study of Long Term, Periodic Light Variations in Algol Binaries|Ronald S.|Polidan|USC|Recent ground based observations of algol binary systems have shown that two stars, AU Mon and RX Cas, exhibit long periodic term (P = 411^d and 516^d respectively) light variations outside of eclipse. We propose to examine these photometric variations in the UV and attempt to establish their origin(s). The principal star in this investigation is AU Mon. Recent high dispersion IUE observations of this star have shown that it occasionally has strong absorption lives of N V. Si IV, and C IV in its spectrum. 71e limited observations suggest that the lines re present only when the star is in the light minimum portion of the 4112 cycle. TWO low dispersion observations of AU Mon indicate that light variations are present in the UV and that they may be of larger amplitude than the visual variations. High and low resolution observations of AU Mon are proposed to explore the possible link between the high ionization absorption lines and the long period light variations. Low resolution observations of RX Cas are also proposed in order to study its photometric properties and to compare it with AU Mon. Limited observations of U Cep and lambda Tau are also planned. Voyager (912 - 1200 A) observations of AU Mon, U Cap, and lambda Tau are also planned to support the IUE data.|Y
CBIEG|Eclipsing Binary Systems in Conflict with General Relativity: As Camelopardalis|Edward F.|Guinan|Villanova|In eclipsing binary star systems, the motion of the major axis of the relative orbit of the stars is called  apsidal  motion. There are two contributions to this motion: 1) The stars are not point masses; there are deformations of the stars due to their intrinsic rotation, and there are deformations caused by their mutual tidal forces. These two effects provide the classical components of apsidal motion. 2) General Relativity predicts that the line of apse should also advance due to the nature of gravity - that distortion in space and time caused by the presence of the mass of the stars. In almost every case , the classical effects overwhelmingly dominate, and it is not possible to adequately test the accuracy or validity of the relativistic component. However, DI Herculis provides such a test, and the observed advance of the  periastron  is only one-seventh the value expected from General Relativity and classical effects. Thus apsidal motion in DI Her appears in conflict with General Relativity. Although we have searched for other classical mechanisms to resolve this conflict, none has been found.  AS Cam, like DI Her, is an eclipsing binary star system in an eccentric orbit, and AS Cam has well-determined photometric and orbital parameters, and it exhibits an apsidal motion only onethird the theoretically expected value (Khaliullin and Kozreva 1983). It is, therefore, important to establish whether or not AS Cam is another binary system at odds with General Relativity- However, we must thoroughly investigate the system to determine if there exist classical explanations for the discrepant apsidal motion: for example, the presence of a third member of the system, the existence of circumbinary gas, or tidally-induced stellar pulsations of the components. Spectra obtained at optical wavelengths do not exhibit any unusual features, and no ultraviolet spectra of this important system have been obtained with IUE thus far. The IUE therefore may reveal why this system has an orbital motion that is discrepant with the theory. A null result is important, for then we must begin to question seriously whether or not there exist problems with the classical theory of apsidal motion or an inconsistency with General Relativity.|Y
CBIJE|Gravity Darkening OF V535 Arae|Joel A.|Eaton|Indiana University|Transfer of luminosity between the components of a contact binary is predicted to change the gravity darkening of a radiative star If the transfer occurs close enough to the binary's surface. These effects bear directly on the stability of contact binaries, hence on much of binary star evolution. A reduction in gravity darkening has been detected in systems with spectral type near F1, which should have radiative envelopes with very little residual convection. To see how the slight amount of convection in late A and early F stars affects the results, it is proposed to observe a hotter contact binary, the A7-8 type system V535 Arae, and determine its gravity darkening.|Y
CBIKL|Far UV Study of Supergiant Semidetached and Contact Systems|Kam-Ching|Leung|Nebraska|It is generally believe that in close binary evolution some systems eveole into a semidetached or contact configuration and these systems are very much related to rapid phase of mass loss/ mass exchange of close binary evolution.  The theoretical modeling of the rapid phase is most difficult and so far has not been successful.  Therefore observational investigation of systems with semidetached and contact configurations is of vital importance to our understanding of close binary evolution.  Many systems with these configurations have been found among late and early-type close binary systems.  These systems largely consist of near main sequence or subgiant dimensions.  Recently Leung and Li found semidetached and contact systems with dimensions of those of supergiant stars.  These systems have periods from about one hundred to hundred fifty days.  Their primary components consist of early-type stars (about B stars).  We are unable to detect or to determine accurately the secondary spectras from the ground-based (blue-violet) spectras.  It is necessary to obtain middle to far UV spectra of moderate resolution to secure uncontaminated spectra of moderate resolution to secure uncontaminated spectra of the hot secondary components.  Thus, we wish to utilize the IUE (data in archives as well as new observations) to obtain low-dispersion spectras (SWP and LWR) to investigate the spectral-type/ temperature of the early-type secondary components.  With better determinations of the temperature we could eliminate one free parameter (adjustable parameter) in deriving the photometric solution.  Thus we could determine the configuration of the important very long period close binary systems more accurately.|Y
CBIMP|Emission in Non-Degenerate Interacting Binaries: Intensities and Spatial Distributions|Mirek J.|Plavec|UCLA|This is my most important project for the 9th year of IUE. I propose to obtain data on spatial distribution and stratification of the-circumstellar line emitting regions surrounding non-degenerate interacting binaries. The observed emission lines (N V, Si IV, C IV, Al III, Fe III, etc., but not He II) arise in a vast and probably expanding "superchromosphere", which apparently derives its energy from the potential energy of the impacting stream released during the process of accretion. In strongly interacting systems of large dimensions, the Serpentids, the bodily eclipses affect the line intensities to only a small degree, variable from system to system. In the systems of smaller sizes, i.e. in the classical Algols, the eclipses do affect the line intensities, judging from my IUE run through the eclipse of U Cephei (ref. C2 #3).  I propose to make similar runs, each within one US 2 shift, through the primary eclipses of V356 Sagittarii, RY Geminorum, TT Hydrae, and, with lower priority, RY Persei. These systems were selected since the emission lines are strong, the total phase is long enough, and the geometrical position of the eclipsing body changes sufficiently during one shift. All the exposure times have been tested in my previous observations. I also propose to observe the total eclipse of V356 Sagittarii at high-dispersion in one US I shift, in order to obtain profiles of the emission and absorption lines of the loser.  W Crucis is a large system in which the emission line strengths do not change during the primary eclipse, when the GI Ia star is eclipsed. I propose to observe the secondary eclipse, during which this huge star may be eclipsing a non-negligible portion of the line-emitting region if that region is centered on the other, invisible star in the system.|Y
CBINE|Cepheid Binarity and Star Formation|Nancy Remage|Evans|CSC|Classical Cepheids are important for extragalactic distance calibration and star formation studies. A survey the fifty brightest classical Cepheids in our galaxy to search for blue companions will provide the following:  An accurate determination of the percentage of Cepheid binaries with companions more massive than 2 MO and with mass ratios as small as M (COMP) / M(cep) - 1/3. This will provide valuable information on star formation for intermediate mass stars in the mass ratio and period ranges poorly sampled by other techniques. An accurate identification of Cepheids with bright companions and hence improved calibrations of temperature, reddening, and luminosity scales.  A stringent test of reddening from the visual region for many Cepheids. These results must be determined from a survey of Cepheids in our galaxy since crowding in external galaxies will confuse the detection of physical companions, and orbital radial velocity material will not be available to provide additional information on mass and period distribution. While this survey builds on the 36 Cepheids already observed with IUE, it is vital to observe the 23 other stars on this program in order to obtain unbiased statistics because many of the observations in the archives were made because the stars were suspected of having companions.|Y
CBJJS|Origin and Meaning of Red-Displaced 0.00 EV Lines in Gamma 1 Velorum|Jorge|Sahade|Argentina|Sahade and Hernandez (1984) discovered on only one of four IUE images of the single-lined spectroscopic binary gamma(1) Velorum (orbital period: 1.482575 days) taken in 1979, the presence of sharp reddisplaced lines arising from 0.00 eV, and perhaps 0.01 eV, levels and suggesting velocities of +200 km s^-1. The presently proposed investigation aims at understanding the origin and the meaning of such red-displaced sharp absorption features.|Y
CBJMP|Emissions From Interacting Non-Degenerate Binaries|Mirek J.|Plavec|UCLA|I propose to continue my systematic studies of strongly interacting nondegenerate binary systems, in two directions: (1) Determine the characteristics of the component stars; (2) Obtain additional data on spatial distribution and stratification of the circumstellar "hot" line emitting regions surrounding the stars. The observed emission lines (N V, Si IV, C IV, Al III, Fe III, etc., but not He II) arise in a vast and probably expanding " superchromosphere", which apparently derives its energy from the potential energy of the impacting stream released during the process of accretion.  So far, I have found surprising differences in the location of this fairly hot and obviously turbulent circumstellar plasma: In U Cephei, it must lie close to the accreting star, since the lines are strongly affected by eclipses; SX Cassiopeiae shows an intermediate effect; the other systems of large dimensions, the Serpentids, as well as the Algols TT Hydrae and RY Geminorum, show line strengths nearly independent of the eclipses.  I plan to examine further systems and to make a run through the eclipse of UX Monocerotis and through the second part of eclipse in U Cephei.  I need out-of-eclipse observations of UX Monocerotis and V367 Cygni in order to determine the parameters of the stars; without that, it is impossible to establish the distance and hence the absolute strength of the emissions.  W Crucis is a large system in which the emission line strengths do not change during the primary eclipse, when the GI la star is eclipsed. I propose to observe the secondary eclipse, during which this huge star may be eclipsing a non-negligible portion of the line-emitting region if that region is centered on the other, invisible star in the system.|Y
CBJNE|Binary Cepheids|Nancy Remage|Evans|Canada|Major progress has been made in the last twenty years in providing the observations necessary to establish the masses arid luminosities of classical Cepheids. We focus on the 25 Cepheids with observed orbital motion and request IUE low dispersion SWP observations for 6 stars, to be combined with the archival material for the rest. From the SWP observations we can derive the temperatures of the companions, and hence infer their luminosities, distances, and masses. In approximately a third of the cases, non-detection of a companion provides an upper limit to its temperature of 8000 K. We discuss the assumptions that the companions are on or near the main sequence, and that Cepheid masses are evolutionary masses. The IUE observations will produce the following results: 1. A luminosity for any Cepheid with a newly detected companion. Specifically, the collaborative NASA/ESA exposure of the 18 day Cepheid YZ Car will provide a distance for a high luminosity Cepheid. It is particularly important to have a well-defined period-luminosity relation at long periods for extragalactic work.  2. An upper limit to the mass of DL Cas which is likely to be close to the evolutionary mass.  3. The distribution of binary mass ratios, down to M(2) / M(1) = 0.3. This basic information about star formation is a supplement to main sequence studies in the orbital period range where few examples exist. It will check the unusual mass ratio distribution for O stars.  4. The necessary preparations in the ultraviolet to measure accurate radial velocities of the companions with the High Resolution Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope. The ratio of the orbital velocity amplitudes of the Cepheid and the companion provides a dynamical mass ratio, and hence the mass of the Cepheid.|Y
CBJTA|The Atmospheric Eclipsing Binary HR 2554|Thomas B.|Ake|CSC|Follow up observations are proposed of the binary system HR 2554 which we have just found to be another possible zeta Aur-like eclipsing system. This is the second such system we have discovered with IUE. The secondary star is detected directly only in the ultraviolet and appears to be a normal A0 main sequence star. The primary is a G6 II star with a 195 day spectroscopic orbit, which we have revised using LWR high-dispersion radial-velocity determinations from previous observations. Eclipse observations so far cover only a partial phase 3 days after predicted conjunction when the secondary was 85% obscured by the G star. As in systems of this type, strong absorption lines in the far and mid-UV are seen superimposed on the secondary's spectrum at this time. Further UV observations are needed at various times near eclipse to map out the extent and homogeneity of this material. A ground-based campaign is being organized to better define the photometric parameters during the May 1987 eclipse to support IUE observations for the November 1987 one. Along with 22 Vul, these systems are the only ones in which the outer atmospheres of luminous G stars can be directly studied.|Y
CBKBH|UV Observations of the High Mass-Ratio Contact Binary OO AQL|Bruce J.|Hrivnak|Valparaiso|00 AQ1 is an unusual W UMa binary in that it possesses a mass ratio near unity (0.82). This suggests that it only recently evolved into contact, and thus it represents a rare, transient phase in the evolution of contact binaries. We propose to observe this system with IUE with the following two primary objectives. First, we plan to study the phase variation in the chromospheric emission by monitoring the MgII emission, as a test of the starspot model for the intrinsic light curve variation. Second, we plan to investigate the periodactivity relation in this unusual, short-period binary by measuring the highexcitation transition region emission with the SWP camera, which can then be compared with other cool contact systems and short-period detached systems. These spacecraft observations will be supported by ground-based photometry and spectroscopy.|Y
CBKGP|UV Observations of AU MON Through its Long-Term Light Cycle|Geraldine J.|Peters|USC|AU Monocerotis is an Algol type binary system that displays permanent double peaked H-alpha emission, a high temperature plasma on its trailing hemisphere, and an interesting periodic long-term (411^d) variation of 01.3 in its optical light. Using high resolution IUE data obtained at epochs of maximum and minimum light, I recently found that the mass transfer rate is largest when the star is faint, but the high temperature plasma is more prominent when the star is bright. Furthermore, the accretion disk in the system appears to be more dense when the star is faint. This system gives us a unique opportunity to study the response of an accretion disk in an Algol binary system to variations in the rate of mass transfer. High and low resolution IUE observations are proposed for six phase points in its long-term light cycle to investigate the effect of the variable mass transfer in this system on the primary star, disk, and other components of its circumstellar matter. Since the period for the activity is 411 days, I propose that the observations be carried through during the course of two years.|Y
CBKJE|Interacting Binaries Containing Cool Giants|Joel A.|Eaton|Indiana University|Observations are proposed for studying the interaction between a main-sequence star and its giant companion's wind In two long-period binaries. Low dispersion spectra for UU Cnc (K4 III + not) will be used to determine the nature of its secondary component, to allow a solution of its light curve, and to study absorption of light in its chromosphere. High-dispersion LWP spectra of AL Vel, obtained at phases of the eclipse of the B8 star by the chromosphere of the KO giant, will be used to relate strengths, velocities, equivalent widths, and shapes of chromospheric absorption lines to properties of the chromospheric gas. The analysis will use synthetic eclipse spectra as calculated recently for 31 Cygni and will determine such fundamental physical properties as ionization, electron density, excitation temperature, and geometric extent of chromospheric gas and, we hope, properties of the K giant's wind.|Y
CBKMP|Two Nonconformist Binaries|Mirek J.|Plavec|UCLA|I propose to observe two detached binary systems which seem to violate the established relations mass - luminosity and/or mass - spectral type radius luminosity. These two systems have been reported to be among the moat massive binary systems known. In both cases the excessively high masses are probably spurious, but the systems are no doubt massive and will remain very interesting even if I help demonstrate the Incorrectness of the published values for masses, which is one of the purposes of this project.  EO Aurigae should have masses larger than 20 m(sun) according to Pearce, but the visibility of the secondary spectrum was challenged by Popper, who claims that the visible spectrum is B3, while the more massive and more luminous component has weaker spectral lines, being near BO. This would be a quite unusual situation, and the UV spectra promise to verify the spectral types.  V505 Monocerotis was reported to have masses 50 and 27 m(sun) but again, the visibility of the secondary lines is doubtful, as is its spectrum, 35. If the secondary optical lines are spurious, the mass determination is invalid. A possible source of confusion is the suspected presence of a shell around the primary star. I propose to determine the spectral types, depth of eclipses, and check an the presence of circumstellar Satter.  The UV study of these two systems is of fundamental importance for our understanding of stellar structure and evolution; every time an apparent violation of the basic relations is suspected. it must be investigated.|Y
CBKRP|Simultaneous Ginga, Voyager, and IUE Observations of Beta Lyrae|Ronald S.|Polidan|Arizona|We propose to obtain simultaneous Ginga (x-ray), Voyager UVS (far-UV), and IUE (UV) observations of the massive, interacting eclipsing binary beta Lyr. Recent Voyager observations have shown that the disk-like secondary in beta Lyr can be characterized as a massive, CV-like accretion disk. Extended observations have shown that this disk is unstable, experiencing significant flux variability, including outbursts. Eclipses of the disk shortward of -1200 A are not observed. The primary objectives of this study are to obtain multifrequency observations of the continuum and line emissions. These data will be used to study the evolution of the flux variations in the disk and stellar continua, search for associations between these variations and those found in the emission lines, attempt to correlate changes in the disk with those occurring in the B811 secondary star, and compare these results with similar published data on cataclysmic variables and other accretion disk dominated systems.|Y
CBLEG|Gas Dynamics, Accretion, and Evolution of Algol-Type Binaries|Edward F.|Guinan|Villanova|We propose IUE observations of three representative Algol-type binary systems - R Ara, U Cep, and Algol (= beta Per) around their orbits. These systems are in the rapid, moderate, and slow stages of mass transfer and mass loss, respectively. We are requesting to observe these important systems with the SWP and LWP high dispersion cameras over an interval of 4 1/2 consecutive days and are requesting 5 US] and 4 US2 shifts while 4 ESA/SERC shifts are being requested by our colleagues in Europe. This will insure full phase coverage for R Ara which has an orbital period of 4.25 days and permit U Cep and Algol to be observed over - 1.5 orbital cycles each. This is the first time that any of these systems have been observed continuously with IUE (or with any other instrument). These observations will permit detailed mapping of gas flows and regions of accretion and kinetic heating in the systems. Moreover, we will determine the level of surface activity of the cooler components of these systems by measuring the strength of the chromospheric Lyman a emission feature.  An international campaign is being organized in which coordinated intensive ground-based photoelectric, polarimetric, and spectroscopic observations will be conducted. In addition, x-ray, infrared, and radio observations are being requested or arranged. This could be the last opportunity for gathering an important database on these stars because no other instrument (now or in the next 10 years) but the IUE can effectively and efficiently carry out this program.|Y
CBLFF|Synchronization in Chromospherically Active Binaries|Francis C.|Fekel|Vanderbilt|Past observational studies of binary synchronization have examined its dependence on orbital period because it is the easiest observational parameter to determine. However, theoretically, synchronization is much more dependent on the ratio d/R where d is the separation of the two stars and R is the radius of the star. A study of synchronization in late-type binaries with the parameter d/R is in progress. R sin i can be determined for chromospherically active binaries. If the system is also a double lined binary, d sin i can be determined. Unfortunately many of the longer period systems are single-lined. But a number of these single-lined systems have large mass functions suggesting that the secondary is an earlier-type star, If the secondary spectral type can be determined from its ultraviolet spectrum, d sin i can be determined, resulting in a determination of d/R. If secondaries are found for 50% of the proposed sample, the usable sample in the critical period range will increase by over 50%.|Y
CBLGP|UV Observations of AU MON Through its Long-Term Light Cycle|Geraldine J.|Peters|USC|AU Monocerotis is an Algol type binary system that displays permanent double peaked H-alpha emission, a high temperature plasma on its trailing hemisphere, and an interesting periodic long-term (411d) variation of O^m.3 in its optical light. Using high resolution IUE data obtained at epochs of maximum and minimum light, I recently found that the mass transfer rate is largest when the star is faint, but the high temperature plasma is more prominent when the star is bright. Furthermore, the accretion disk in the system appears to be more dense when the star is faint. This system gives us a unique opportunity to study the response of an accretion disk in an Algol binary system to variations in the rate of mass transfer. High and low resolution IUE observations are proposed for six phase points in its long-term light cycle to investigate the effect of the variable mass transfer in this system on the primary star, disk, and other components of its circumstellar matter. Since the period for the activity is 411 days, I propose that the observations be carried through during the course of two years.|Y
CBNES|IUE Echelle Studies of the Very Luminous ROSAT EUV Source SFC1631+782|Edward M.|Sion|Villanova University|We propose to obtain a series of high resolution SWP and LWP IUE spectra of the newly discovered ROSAT source WFC1631+781, an unusually bright DA1 + dM close binary, which is nearly -identical to Feige 24 and has the same EUV brightness as the Hyades post-common envelope binary V471 Tauri. These three binaries are the only post-common envelope systems accessible to the IUE echelle. Our scientific objectives are: (1) search for metallic and/or helium absorption at the Einstein-redshifted rest frame of the white dwarf photosphere as a test of (a) radiative forces/diffusion theory versus accretion as the source of metals/helium, and (b) as a diagnostic of the EUV opacity due to either a stratified H/He atmosphere with an extremely thin H layer or a thicker H layer with trace metals; (2) measure a gravitational redshift for the white dwarf using detected sharp features in our SWP echelle spectra along with knowing the radial velocity of the M dwarf companion currently being observed with the UK 4.2m at La Palma; (3) Search for shortward shifted absorption manifesting either a circumbinary expanding shell, white dwarf wind, or M dwarf wind material absorbing white dwarf continuum photons; (4) pending the forthcoming orbit solution, to explore the chromosphere/coronal transition region structure of the NI dwarf and took for orbital phase-dependent modulation of its line features and other effects due to irradiation of its facing hemisphere by the the hot white dwarf.|Y
CBNJE|The Chromosphere and Wind of Al Velorum|Joel A.|Eaton|Tennessee State University|Eclipses of a hot star by the outer atmosphere of a cool star make it possible to determine physical conditions in chromospheres of cool stars in ways impossible from analyzing emission spectra. Observations of such atmospheric eclipses have normally been restricted to K and M supergiants, but there is now a far less luminous bright giant, AL Vel (K0 III + B8 V), which extends this technique to less luminous stars. Existing high dispersion spectra cover two phases of chromospheric eclipse. Further spectra are needed to study (1) the deepest phases of atmospheric eclipse when the B star is almost in contact with the K giant and (2) the part of the orbit when the B dwarf is in front, which will allow the velocity structure of the wind of the K giant to be analyzed. These spectra will be used to relate strengths, velocities, and shapes of chromospheric absorption lines to properties of the chromospheric gas. The analysis will use synthetic eclipse spectra as calculated recently for AL Vel itself by Eaton, McCluskey, Kondo, and Shore (1990) and will determine such fundamental physical properties as degree of ionization, electron density, excitation temperature, and geometric extent of the chromosphere.|Y
CBNRK|Hot, Massive Close Binaries|Robert H.|Koch|U Pennsylvania|Following a measure of success with 2 hot, massive close binaries in the 13th Guest Observing Year, 2 more such objects have been chosen for Round 14. Each of the new pairs - SZ Cam and CW Cep - is important for the mass-radius and mass-luminosity relationships for which there is only a small number of such binaries available. Current ground-based velocity curves of the new targets are of only average and poor qualities. "Snapshot" IUE determinations of these curves using the considerable number of favorable UV lines should improve this situation materially. They will, furthermore, contribute to the improvement of theoretical models which rely heavily on the accuracy of the physical parameters obtained from velocity and light curves. Essentially nothing is known from ground of the wind behavior of SZ Cam and it is predicted, by analogy with Y Cyg, that there will be considerable streaming gas evidenced for CW Cep. It is a significant additional aim of this program to validate or deny the hypothesis that ground-based polarimetry is capable of predicting the the suitability of UV spectra for velocity curve accumulation.|Y
CBOEG|UV Chromospheric Acitivity in Cool, Short-Period Contact Binaries|Edward F.|Guinan|Villanova University|W UMa-type binaries are short period contact systems which consist of cool (spectral type F-K) main sequence stars. Their tidally enforced rapid rotations (v(rot) - 80-160 km/s) provide important laboratories for studying magnetic dynamo theory. W UMa stars display some of the highest levels of chromospheric and coronal emissions of all cool stars. The existing sample of -15 short period W UMa stars observed with IUE indicates a possible relationship between MgII emission and orbital period and color, as well as a possible dichotomy between systems with high and low levels of chromospheric activity in binaries with otherwise similar properties.  We are proposing to observe another 12 such binaries which will nearly double the sample of short period (P<=0^d.4) W UMa stars observed with IUE. Included in this program is the recently discovered very short period system YZ Phe and the Praesepe cluster member TX Cnc. None of the 12 proposed stars have been observed with IUE. The addition of these 12 systems to the available database of short period W UMa binaries will allow a more definitive study to be made of the relationships between chromospheric activity and magnetic dynamos in rapidly rotating stars.|Y
CBORK|Hot, Massive Close Binaries|Robert H.|Koch|U Pennsylvania|Five hot, massive close binaries form the substance of this proposal. with our U.K. collaborators, we intend to accumulate enough SWP highresolution spectra of them in order to analyze their spectroscopic orbits and determine their masses to high precisions. Such results lead directly to the control of all stellar evolutionary theories at the top of the main sequence. The same spectra will also be analyzed for the wind-flow activity or the absence of it, which results guide studies concerning nonconservative evolution. Currently available data from ground and from space are inadequate for these purposes. The spectra will also be reduced to "monochromatic" light curves in line cores and in adjacent continuum levels. In our HD 198846 (Y Cyg) images the continuum light curves resemble the familiar ones from ground, i.e., those of a well-detached binary, while the windsensitive, line-core light curves are morphologically those of a contact binary. This result has been interpreted to arise from an envelope at least as large as, and probably larger than, the critical Roche equipotential "surfaces" (Roche lobes). We want to test if the same situation exists for all similarly detached hot close binaries.|Y
CBRRK|Hot, Massive Close Binaries IV|Robert H.|Koch|U Pennsylvania|Three hot, massive close binaries form the substance of this proposal. With our U.K. collaborators, we intend to accumulate enough SWP high-resolution spectra of them for 2 purposes. (1) The spectroscopic orbits and the stellar masses or projected masses will be determined to high precision. These masses and the radii derived from light curve analyses (obtained from ground) contribute directly to the control of stellar evolutionary theory at the top of the main sequence. (2) The same spectra will be analyzed for the average wind-flow activity, which results guide studies concerning non-conservative evolution. The spectra will also be reduced for flux-level "light" curves in wind-sensitive line cores. We know from detailed study of spectra (from former IUE rounds) that such flux-level curves reveal the eclipses of the wind material between the stars. The absorption residuals from the wind modelling are to be studied for the interactions between the winds and between the wind from one star and the companion star.|Y

CCBEB|Classical Stellar Chromospheres and Dependence on Teff, and Chemical Abundances|Erika|Bohm-Vitense|Washington|I would like to continue to observe stars which appear in the HR diagram close to the dividing line between the convective and non-convective stars. Since convection is supposed to be a necessary condition for the formation of chromospheres we should be able to determine the boundary line for convection from the boundary line for the existence of classical chromospheres.  I would like to continue to investigate whether the phenomenon of metallic line stars can in any way be related to the onset of convection and thereby to the presence or absence of chromospheres.  We also want to observe a few manganese stars in order to check if any effects of the surface convection zone due to He ionization could be detected in the UV spectrum of Mn stars.  I would like to extend the study of the onset of convection to the region of the He rich hot white dwarfs for which convection is expected for temperatures up to 30,000 K.  Of special interest would be the observation of some dwarf novae.  I would like to study chromospheres and transition layers of Pop II stars, red giants and subdwarfs and compare those to Pop I stars. Knowing the chromospheric spectra of field Pop II stars, I would like to analyse the integrated spectra of globular clusters and their center to limb variation. One might hope to be able to determine the population and perhaps the break off of the lower main sequence which appears to depend on the metal abundance of the cluster.  The study of the globular clusters will also reveal the presence or absence of hot blue objects and their distribution in the cluster. If the lambda 2200 absorption could be detected this may give some information about the presence of interstellar dust and gas in the clusters, which is expected to be there but has not yet been found.|Y
CCBJL|Chromospheres, Transition Regions, & Coronae in DME Flare & Comparison Dwarf Stars|Jeffery L.|Linsky|Colorado|We request IUE observations of the emission line spectra of dMe flare stars (during and outside of flares) and comparison dwarf stars. We specifically request low dispersion short wavelength spectra to study lines of He II, C II-IV, N V, O I-V, and Si II-IV and long wavelength spectra to study lines of Mg II. These data will be used to develop models for the chromospheres, transition regions, and, if feasible, coronae of these stars. We will also assess the energy balance in the outer atmospheres of these stars and compare flaring and quiescent dMe stars to comparison K dwarfs and quiet, active, and flaring regions on the Sun. Successful completion of this program will enable us to compare flare star processes to similar solar phenomena, as well as to determine the possible importance of flare stars to interstellar medium dynamics.|Y
CCCAW|Chromospheres Coronae and Transition Regions of Main Sequence and Giant Stars in Hyades|A.|Walker|Stanford|We propose to observe chromospheric and transition Region lines for selected main sequence and giant stars in the Hyades cluster, using the IUE Observatory. Two of the Investigators (RAS and SKA) are presently carrying out a search for soft x-ray emission from stellar coronae in the Hyades using the Einstein Observatory. Although the survey is not yet complete, two sources have already been identified with cluster stars in the two fields which have already been analyzed. An additional 23 fields are yet to be analyzed, so we anticipate that 10 - 20 cluster stars will be shown to have coronal x-ray emission. We propose to obtain flux determinations for emission lines excited in the temperature range from 10^4 K to 3 x 10^5 K, which, when combined with the Einstein observations, will allow a differential emission measure to be calculated for each cluster source observed. This data will be used to test models of coronal beating in main sequence and giant stars.|Y
CCCBB|Studies of New Bright Chromospherically Active Stars|Bernard W.|Bopp|Toledo|The work of Linsky, Dupree and others has shown that late-type stars with evidence of high chromospheric activity in the visible (e.g., emission lines of Ca II and hydrogen) also possess a rich emission spectrum in the ultraviolet. Most importantly, UV observations allow us to probe the temperature and density structure of stellar chromospheres, and give us clues as to why one star is surface-active and another is not.  A research program of spectroscopy currently under way at Ritter Observatory, University of Toledo, has resulted in the discovery of several bright new chromospherically active stars. Some of the objects are spectroscopically quite remarkable, showing evidence of very rapid rotation, but the stars are not clearly identifiable as close binaries in synchronous rotation. We propose IUE observations of these objects in order to compare their UV spectra with those of other active chromosphere stars. With these data we can 1) Confirm the stars as chromospherically active C-C-BE 2) Establish if the visible emission is a surface phenomenon or a result of interaction in a binary system 3)  Obtain numerical information on chromospheric structure 4) Investigate the effects of single star rotation on chromospheric activity.|Y
CCCEB|Dependence of Stellar Chromospheres on Metal Abundance Rotation, and Age|Erika|Bohm-Vitense|Washington|It is proposed to study the stellar chromospheric emission and its dependence on metal abundances, rotation and age. If the emission is enhanced by rapid rotation of the stars it will indicate that acoustic heating will be unimportant for the formation of chromospheres and coronae since the acoustic flux generation should not depend on rotation. We want to study variability in the chromospheric emission of some supergiants.  We also want to determine luminosity differences between normal stars and metallic line stars. These measurements will also provide bolometric corrections for these stars. For stars with known angular diameters effective temperatures can be determined directly. This study will show whether different surface metal abundance is the only major difference between metallic line A stars and normal A stars as suggested by the diffusion hypothesis.|Y
CCCJL|A Fresh Look at Capella Dichotomy J|Jeffery L.|Linsky|Colorado|Exploratory observations of Capella (alpha Aurigae: G6 III + F9 III) during the early operations of IUE revealed, quite unexpectedly, that the rapidly rotating secondary is the key to the unusual ultraviolet emission properties of the system.  We feel that the proximity of a genuinely active star, namely Capella B, offers a unique opportunity to study time variability of ultraviolet emission line strengths and line shapes. In addition, our analysis of the previous Capella spectra has raised several questions that were not anticipated in the design of the original observing program. Consequently, the existing data have proved, in several instances, to be inadequate to address the new questions properly. For example, we find a curious emission pattern in lines formed near 10^5 K, that may be caused by individual active regions or large magnetic flux tubes on the rapidly rotating secondary. Unfortunately, we do not have the sequential, echelle mode exposures necessary to test whether the emission Patterns are systematic or stochastic. In addition, the existing data have relatively poor phase coverage of the binary orbit. For example, we find that we now need spectra at both elongations (where the velocity separation of the two stars is maximum), in order to reliably estimate the unexpectedly faint contribution of the primary to the composite hot line emission. (observations at only one of the elongations are currently available.) We also need better coverage of the orbit to determine whether apparent emission peak asymmetry changes are phase-dependent or not.  We outline below an observing program that is based on the experience gained in the early observations of Capella. Our new program is designed to produce a high-quality data base, with reasonable phase coverage of the binary orbit, in order to answer some of the still unresolved and puzzling questions raised by our analysis of the initial IUE observations of the Capella system.|Y
CCCKH|Rotational Modulation and Cyclic Behavior of Ultraviolet    Chromospheric Emission in Near-Solar Type Stars|Kenneth|Hallam|NASA/GSFC|We again propose to investigate the rotational and cyclic behavior of solar and near-solar type stars by means of their ultraviolet chromospheric emission, starting with this round of IUE observations. Our initial set of observations will be used primarily to follow the variations in the strength of prominent ultraviolet chromospheric emission features throughout the rotational period of a few stars of near-solar type. Typical features include 0 I, 1305A; C II, 1335A; 0 I, 1357A; Si IV, 1394 and 1403A; C IV, 1550A; CI, 1657A; Si II, 1812A; and Mg II, 2800A. We also plan to begin the systematic monitoring of several such stars for evidence of much longer period cyclic behavior, analogous to the 11 year cycle in solar sunspots and other activity. The significance of these measurements is discussed in detail in the proposal. It is planned to coordinate these observations with those of stellar Ca II H and K emission taken from Hale Observatories.|Y
CCCLK|A Study of Chromospheric Activity in Spectroscopic Binary Systems|L.|Kuhi|California|Spectroscopic binaries show a tendency to exhibit higher levels of chromospheric activity than single stars of the same spectral type. This is thought to be because of their close binary nature and the resultant tidal coupling of the two stars. We will use IUE to gain a quantitative measure of the activity in systems with a variety of physical parameters. This allows us to study the underlying cause of the activity, and to model the upper atmospheres of systems with various activity levels. Combined with HEAO-2 data on the same systems, we hope to further our general physical understanding of the chromospheric-coronal phenomenon.|Y
CCCMG|The Evolution of the Chromospheres and Transition Regions in Dwarf Stars|Mark S.|Giampapa|Arizona|We propose to study the active chromosphere stars xi Boo A and 70 Oph A. These are solar type stars which exhibit much larger levels of chromospheric activity than the sun. There are two complementary aspects of this proposal. Our first objective is to obtain high spectral resolution observations of upper chromospheric and transition region spectral diagnostics. These data will be used to model the quiescent states of these stars and compare their upper atmospheric structure to the sun and other quiet chromosphere G dwarf stars. Our second objective is to perform a coordinated optical, X-ray, radio, and IUE ultraviolet spectral monitoring of these two stars to study flare events. In particular we hope to observe flare events, model flare structure, and compare the derived physical conditions in stellar flares to solar events. We have recently observed extensive large magnetic fields on these stars, and we believe they exhibit frequent flares. We are confident that time resolved data needed to model the stellar flares is obtainable in the required spectral bands, including the IUE ultraviolet region. The results of these studies will improve our understanding of solar and stellar chromospheric and non-radiative phenomena.|Y
CCCRS|Study of Chromospheres and Circumstellar Envelopes in G, K, M Supergiants|Robert E.|Stencel|Colorado|We propose to continue work begun this summer with IUE 2nd year observations of cool supergiants. With the initial data, we have begun to derive physical models for chromospheres and circumstellar envelopes of cool supergiants of spectral types G, K and M. Emission lines with complex profile structure appear throughout the LWR region, including the Mg II resonance lines at 2800 the Mg I resonance line at 2852 A and a large number of Fe I and Fe II lines spanning the 2200 to 3000 A region. These lines show chromospheric emission components and blue-shifted circumstellar absorption components. We have started the process of modeling these profiles using a sphericalgeometry, partial-redistribution computer code which simultaneously solves the coupled equations of statistical equilibrium and radiative transfer in the co-moving frame of the absorbing atoms and ions. As we are particularly interested in the dynamics of the mass loss processes in these stars and the extent to which the outer atmospheres are inhomogeneous, additional IUE spectra for supergiants over the full range in effective temperature, gravity and strength of C IF 1549 A are needed to complete the physical analysis just begun by the limited IUE observing time provided during its second year. Results of the analysis to date include physical models for the supergiants Beta Draconis and Alpha Ori which match their observed Mg II and Ca II emission profiles, along with the discovery of unexpected effects in line formation which imply "thin" chromospheres for supergiants of late-type.|Y
CCDAD|UV STudies of Evolved Chromospheres & Coronae in Giants in the Praesepe Cluster|Andrea K.|Dupree|Harvard CFA - SAO|We propose to obtain ultraviolet spectra of late-type giants In the Praesepe Cluster to Investigate the properties of chromospheres and coronae In evolved stars.|Y
CCDAW|A Study of the Chromospheres, Coronae and Transition Regions of Main Sequence and Giant Stars|A.|Walker|Stanford|We propose to extend the observations which we recently ( about 5 weeks ago) carried out on IUE of chromospheric and transition lines in main sequence and giant stars in the Hyades Cluster. When our first proposal was submitted, we were still carrying out a survey of the Hyades with the Einstein Satellite, and only partial results were available. The survey is now complete, and has resulted in the detection of over 40 discrete sources in the central cluster, most of which can be identified with members of the cluster. In our previous observing run, we were able to observe only 7 stars, due to the long observing times required to detect these relatively faint stars. Our results are most encouraging. Preliminary data indicates that we have detected CIV and NV lines in several main sequence A, F and G stars. However, we have not yet been able to observe any of the several late type dwarfs (K,M,) observed by Einstein, or to observe several stars of the same spectral types whose x-ray luminosities may differ by as much as an order of magnitude. It might also be instructive to observe one or more Hyades stars which are not observed by Einstein, to attempt to determine whether or not there is chromospheric or transition region activity which might indicate a "star minimum?' with a possible infrared x-ray activity level below the Einstein detection threshold. We are proposing therefore, to carry out further observations in order to continue what is clearly a most fruitful line of research.|Y
CCDHJ|IUE Studies of X-Ray K-M Dwarfs|H. M.|Johnson|Lockheed|K-M dwarfs exhibited a large range of coronal X-ray luminosity Lx in results of the P.I.'s programs with the HEAO-2 (Einstein) observatory. It has been difficult to correlate Lx with any one of several parameters such as rotation, close-binary membership, or age, but a promising lead is chromospheric Ca II emission. The ultraviolet provides better indicators of the activity of the chromospheric-coronal transition region, and the plan is to observe the specified X-ray sample with the IUE so as to establish new correlations between the ultraviolet spectra, X-ray luminosity, and various optical parameters. The P.I.'s X-ray sample is drawn from the nearest K-M dwarfs so it also provides the brightest stars of given type for IUE study. A paper will be published to present at least the complete IUE observational results, and it will constitute the principal deliverable work.|Y
CCDJL|Chromospheres & Transition Regions of Young Stars in Ursa Major Cluster & Stream|Jeffery L.|Linsky|Colorado - JILA|The studies by Wilson and Skumanich of Ca II emission in the main sequence of nearby clusters (Hyades, Praesepe, Coma, and Pleiades) have led to the qualitative result that the degree of chromospheric activity, as measured by the strength of Ca II emission, decreases with age for stars on the main sequence. We propose to determine whether this result can be made quantitative by comparing the surface fluxes of emission lines formed in the chromosphere and transition region of stars in a young cluster with those in an older cluster (the Hyades) and older field stars now being observed or for which studies are completed. We will also compute detailed models for the chromospheres and transition regions of representative young stars of different spectral types to compare with similar models we have computed for older stars.  The Ursa Major group, consisting of the compact Nucleus and extended Stream is the ideal cluster for study to compare with the Hyades and field stars. The Ursa Major group centered at 23 pc from the Sun is a factor of 2 closer than the Hyades and a factor of 2.5 younger. As a result, typical Ursa Major group stars are 2 magnitudes brighter than the Hyades and thus far easier to observe with IUE.|Y
CCDKH|Rotational Modulation & Cyclic Behavior of UV Chromospheric Emission in Near-Solar Type Stars|Kenneth|Hallam|NASA/GSFC|We propose to continue our investigation of the rotational and cyclical behavior of solar and near-solar type stars by means of their ultraviolet chromospheric emission. Our systematic time-sequential series of IUE observations of prominent ultraviolet chromospheric emission features such as HI 1216A, OI 1305A, CII 1335A, Si IV 1394A, C IV 1550A, He II 1640A, CI 1657A, Si II 1812A, and Mg II 2800A permit us to determine the rotational periods of the stars, and to follow their longer-term cyclical behavior, analagous to the 11 year solar activity cycle. The significance of these measurements is discussed in detail in the proposal. It is planned to coordinate these observations with measurements at Mount Wilson Observatory of stellar Ca II H and K emission flux.|Y
CCDMG|The Transition Regions & Coronae of Solar-Type Stars|Mark S.|Giampapa|CFA|We propose to obtain low dispersion, high signal-to-noise, short wavelength spectra for a sample of solar-type stars for which X-ray data are available. The transition region pressures, as inferred from the short wavelength spectra to be obtained with the IUE satellite, will be compared to the values of the transition region pressures predicted by the scaling laws advanced by Rosner, Tucker and Vaiana (1978) and Golub et al. (1980) on the basis of HEAO-B soft X-ray observations. In addition, we will assess the energy balance in the outer atmospheres of solar-type stars by comparing the total transition region and chromospheric line luminosities to the X-ray luminosities for the stars considered in this proposal.|Y
CCDRN|Study of Active Regions on Solar-Type Dwarfs as a Function  of Rotation and Age|Robert|Noyes|Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory|We propose to obtain ultraviolet spectra of late-type dwarfs with known rotation rates to investigate the presence and emission level of chromospheres and coronae as a function of rotation and age, and to determine the physical structure of active regions or other inhomogeniety within the atmospheres.|Y
CCDRS|Chromospheric Densities & Geometrical Extensions of Late-Type Giant & Supergiants|Robert E.|Stencel|Colorado|There is now considerable evidence, on the basis of IUE spectra and Einstein X-ray fluxes, that the cool half of the HR diagram can be divided into two regions. The first region, including the dwarfs and yellow giants, contains stars with weak winds and hot outer atmospheres (containing transition regions and coronae). The second region, including the red giants and supergiants, contains stars with strong winds and cool plasma. These two regions have a boundary in which stars with both characteristics occur.  We have recently found that ratios among the five lines in the C II 2325 A multiplet and the ratio of the integrated fluxes in the C II 2325 A and 1335 A multiplets are powerful diagnostics of electron densities, temperatures, and geometrical extent (atmospheric extension) of chromospheres in the yellow giants and red giants and supergiants. The few IUE LWR high dispersion exposures with sufficient integration time to date have been used to suggest that cool star chromospheres may be extremely thick, and their dimensions correlated with dominant magnetic topology in the outer atmosphere. We propose (a) to verify the use of the C II 2325 A lines as density diagnostics with long exposures of additional bright cool stars, and (b) to investigate the correlation of inferred chromospheric thickness with location in the HR diagram, relative to the coronal/wind dividing line which occurs along a locus between K1 III and G5 Ib in the HR diagram. With properties thereby calibrated among cool stars, we can use LWR low dispersion observations to obtain C II 2325 A total fluxes to constrain chromospheric thickness among a wider sample of cool giants and supergiants with more extreme properties, and to thereby evaluate temperature and luminosity variations.|Y
CCDTA|SWP Echelle Spectra of Chromospherically Active Dwarf Stars|Thomas R.|Ayres|Colorado|High resolution spectra of the 1150-2000 A region are enormously valuable for probing outer- atmosphere structure in cool stars. For example, such data can be used to separate blends, identify individual emission components in short-period binary systems, determine intensity ratios in close multiplets, estimate reliable emission strengths of lines superimposed on bright stellar continua, and test for the presence or absence of stellar winds at 105 K temperatures. These possibilities are not practical with IUE low-dispersion spectra. However, one must pay a steep-price to obtain useable high-dispersion IUE spectra and the additional dimension of diagnostic information, namely only a handful of the brightest UV sources are accessible even with shift-long exposures.  We propose below an observing program to obtain echelle spectra of chromospherically active dwarf stars in the 1150-2000 A shortwavelength region. This program is intended to explore a particular class of objects that heretofore have not been observed at high dispersion with the SWP camera. Futhermore, this program complements previous SWP echelle studies by our group at the University of Colorado of quiet-chromosphere dwarf stars (alpha Cen A, alpha Cen B), active giants (alpha Aur A, lambda And, beta Dra), and the extreme case of the very active RS CVn-type system HR 1099. As described below, highdispersion spectra of these targets have provided a critical interpretive dimension that was lacking in previous low-dispersion studies. However, several fundamental questions have been raised in the course of our exploratory SWP work on what, in practice, are two distinct classes of chromospheric stars: the quiet dwarfs and the active giants. We feel that many of these questions can be answered by bridging the interpretive gap with a careful study of the active dwarfs.  Our recent experience with shift-long SWP echelle exposures of chromospheric emission stars has suggested that our previous estimates of feasibility were too pessimistic, and that a larger sample of chromospherically bright stars is in fact accessible to IUE. Accordingly, we propose five candidate stars that we believe can be observed successfully with deep SWP echelle-mode exposures. If our proposal is accepted, we intend to collaborate with the Oxford (U-K) cool-star group to attempt a joint 14^h exposure of one of the brighter targets -- xi Boo A -- to provide an active-dwarf spectrum that is well exposed even at the weaker diagnostic features of the short-wavelength region.|Y
CCEBB|Southern Active Chromosphere Variables|Bernard W.|Bopp|Toledo|IUE observations are proposed for seven southern hemisphere objects which we found to show evidence for exceptionally active chromospheres from Ca II K and H-alpha emission. IUE spectra will be used to determine the nature of the enhancement in the UV emission line spectra, and to attempt to discriminate each of these objects as RS CVn binaries or FK Com-like ultra-rapid rotators. This can be achieved by examining the ratio of chromospheric and coronal diagnostics.  These objects represent a distillation of a study, conducted from the Mt. Johns Observatory in New Zealand, of over 70 stars thought to be potential RS CVn or FK Com objects. Therefore, these exceptional objects are very promising for strong UV emission, and will prove valuable in the wider context of the rotation-activity theory for late type stars.|Y
CCEJL|Chromospheric Densities and Geometrical Extensions of Late-Type Giants|Jeffrey L.|Linsky|Colorado|Our previous deep high-resolution LWR exposures have shown that the C II intercombination multiplet UV 0.01 near 2325 A is present in the chromospheric spectra of latetype giants and supergiants. We have demonstrated that line ratios within this multiplet are sensitive to electron density in the regime Ne= 10^7-10^9cm^-3, characteristic of these chromospheres. Furthermore, the temperature of the gas can be obtained from the intensity ratio of C II 2325 A to C II 1335 A; measurements of the latter line have already been obtained from low-resolution SWP exposures. When these temperatures and densities are combined with the total flux in the 2325 A multiplet, the geometrical extent of the chromosphere can be calculated. Preliminary results indicate that chromospheres of red giants and supergiants extend several stellar raidii.  Additional deep LWR exposures to record the C II UV 0.01 multiplet are needed to complete coverage of the appropriate part of the HR diagram. Measurements of C II line ratios over a wide range of Ne are needed to calibrate the density diagnostic and to place constraints on the A-values of the transitions. The available archival data do not fill these gaps since unusually long exposures are required.  The same deep exposures can be used for several additional purposes. The multiplet UV 0.01 of Si II (2330-2350 A), which appears to have potential as a density diagnostic for a slightly higher density regime than the C II multiplet, will also be well exposed on these images and will be measured to test this idea. In addition, the photospheric absorptionline spectra of these stars will be properly exposed in the 2600-2900 A region and will be compared to the spectrum of Arcturus which has already been studied in detail.  Analysis of the C II and Si II data will provide badly needed information and constraints for the main objective of this study: the modeling of the structure and energy requirements of the outer atmospheres of late-type stars.|Y
CCEKH|Solar-Like Activity Cycles of Stellar Chromospheres|Kenneth L.|Hallam|NASA/GSFC|We propose to continue our investigation of long-term cyclic activity of near-solar type stars with IUE spectrophotometry of their ultraviolet chromospheres. Our systematic programs of controlled spectrophotometric IUE measurements of dwarf F, G, and K stellar chromospheres initiated in 1980 has resulted in the determination of rotationally modulated flux values for Ly-alpha , MgII, and other ultraviolet emission features of at least 10 stars. A plan is presented for the minimal set of IUE observations which would permit adequate monitoring of the long-term behavior of the ultraviolet chromospheric emission fluxes of these and other similar stars. This investigation will ultimately lead to the determination of cyclic periods, phases, and amplitudes of ultraviolet emission fluxes for several important ions as the level of chromospheric activity changes in these stars over a period of years. The significance of this investigation to our general understanding of stellar chromospheres, and of oscillating phenomena in stellar convection zones is discussed in the proposal.|Y
CCETA|The Wilson-Bappu Effect & Beyond|Thomas R.|Ayres|Colorado|The broad photospheric damping wings and bright chromospheric emission cores of the resonance lines of ionized Magnesium (h and k) and Calcium (H and K) contain an extraordinarily detailed picture of the temperature-height profile of the stellar outer atmosphere. When combined with the wing shapes of the neutral species resonance lines, Mg I 2852 A and Ca I 4227 A, the Mg II h and k and Ca II H and K wings provide an empirical measure of the stellar surface gravity. Furthermore, the core intensities of the six resonance lines indicate the overall rates of plasma radiative cooling at different, but adjacent, levels of the chromosphere. Finally, the emission cores of Mg II k and Ca II K are known to exhibit a remarkable systematic broadening with increasing stellar luminosity--the Wilson-Bappu effect--whose origin remains controversial despite several decades of study. Further fueling that controversy are recent highresolution, ground-based studies of the absorption profile of H I Balmer alpha (6562 A), that demonstrate a general broadening of the chromospheric core with increasing luminosity, although not in a one-to-one correspondence with the Ca II K behavior.  We propose below an observing program to address these several issues by means of coordinated IUE and ground-based observations of a small sample of representative G-K dwarfs and giants. The ground-based side of the study, in collaboration with the Australian National University, will consist of high-resolution spectrograms of Ca II H and K, Ca I 4227 A, H-alpha, and other Balmer lines utilizing the Coude echelle and PCA detector of the Mt. Stromlo 74". supplemented with Cassegrain echelle spectra from the Siding Spring 40". The IUE side of the study will consist of graded sequences of long-wavelength echellograms to optimally expose the bright emission features of Mg II (2800 A) as well as the faint damping wings of Mg II h and k and the chromospheric absorption core of Mg I 2852 A. Previous observational work in this region has tended to concentrate on the Mg II k core itself. Consequently, the low contrast wings are usually recorded at poor signal-to-noise and thereby are useless for theoretical interpretations. Our proposed program is novel in that we will obtain analogous high-resolution, high signal-tonoise profiles of Ca II H and K, Ca I 4227 A and H-alpha as close in time to the IUE spectra as is practical. Near simultaneity is an important consideration since late-type stars are known to exhibit profile changes in their chromospheric emission cores on time scales as short as hours.  We intend to provide, by our coordinated investigation, a high-quality set of calibrated chromospheric emission and absorption line profiles of representative G-K dwarfs and giants to serve as a basis for subsequent detailed numerical simulation studies of radiative cooling, gravity-sensitive wing ratios, and the Wilson-Bappu effect.|Y
CCFAD|Chromospheres in Metal Deficient Giants|Andrea K.|Dupree|CFA|Optical observations of He profiles and theoretical considerations suggest that metal deficient stars have chromospheric structure quite different from those with solar abundances. In particular, due to lower electron and heavy ton density, steeper chromospheric temperature gradients, hotter atmospheres, and stronger near-UV continuum and line fluxes are expected.  We propose to test these ideas with observations of four stars: a metaldeficient field giant and three of the brightest globular cluster giants.|Y
CCFDS|Ultraviolet Studies of Stars in a Pleiades Moving Group|David R.|Soderblom|CFA|Ultraviolet studies of very young late-type dwarfs are needed to understand how stellar chromospheres and transition regions evolve. The Pleiades cluster is too faint to observe with IUE, therefore I have found field stars in the solar neighborhood that share the apace motion of the Pleiades. These Pleiades Group stars have spectroscopic properties that indicate that they are indeed as young as the Pleiades cluster.  I intend to observe these Pleiades Group stars in lieu of their cluster counterparts in order to determine the properties of chromospheres and transition regions at very young ages. In particular, I wish to determine if these young stars produce a greater proportion of their emission in the upper chromosphere than do older stars.|Y
CCFEB|Chromospheric Emission of Close Binaries|Erika|Bohm-Vitense|Washington|It is generally believed that rapid rotation of stars enhances chromospheric emission. Studies of G stars have led to this conclusion. Our studies of Mg II k emission in early F stars only shows that close binaries show increased emission while single rapidly rotating stars with v(r) sin i > 40 km/sec do not. For G stars close binaries are usually the only ones that rotate at a measurable rate. Rapid rotation and binary nature are correlated. For early F stars this is not the case. We therefore propose to study early F star binaries of known periods and different rotational velocities in order to decide on the cause of enhanced emission: either tidal effects in close binaries or rapid rotation.|Y
CCFEG|Coordinated Ultraviolet Spectroscopy and Optical Photometry of FK Comae|Edward F.|Guinan|Villanova|FK Comae (HD 117555) is the prototype of a newly identified class of rapidly rotating, apparently single, cool giants which have strong chromospheric and coronal emission rivalling or surpassing those of the most active RS CVn stars. FK Com is the best studied member of the group. It has spectral type about G2 IIIp, a projected rotational velocity v sin i =120 km/s, and is a low amplitude variable with a 2.4d period. Photometry by Dorren, Guinan and McCook in 1982 shows for the first time that the light curve undergoes rapid changes in amplitude, shape, and phase of light minimum. Such behavior is known for the RS CVn stars, but is generally on longer timescales. Analyses of the 1982 light curves have been carried out and show that the light variations appear to be consistent with subluminous regions ("starspots") on the surface of the rapidly rotating giant. The overall spectroscopic and photometric properties are in general best explained by extreme surface activity induced by rapid rotation. Although rapidly rotating cool giants (v sin i about  20 - 50 km/s) are often members of close binary systems in which tidal effects have produced synchronous rotation, there is no evidence for duplicity in FK Com. This has led Bopp and Stencel to suggest that the FK Com stars are coalesced binaries possibly evolved from W UMa systems.  We propose to obtain IUE observations at minimum and maximum of a fully developed photometric wave, when the active regions are facing and directed away from the observer respectively. The light variations will be monitored it Villanova during 1983-1984 to determine the optimum time for scheduling the lUE observations. The previous IUE observations of FK Com were made when no photometry was available or when the light variations were small. We also propose to observe during a flare. The flaring activity will be monitored b), H-alpha photometry. During 1982 at least three long-lived (3-10d) flare events were seen.|Y
CCFFF|Ultraviolet Observations of Unusual Chromospherically Active Giant Stars|Francis C.|Fekel|SM Systems and Research Corp|From ground based observations we have identified some chromospherically active late-type giants which because they have modest rotational velocities but are apparently single can not be immediately identified with the RS CVn or FK Comae stars. Ultraviolet observations will be made to confirm or rule out the following possibilities for these stars. First, the stars are low inclination RS CVn binaries with F type secondaries. Second, they are low inclination chromospherically active binaries with white dwarf secondaries. Third, they are FK Comas stars seen nearly pole-on. Fourth, they are a possible new class of rapidly rotating single stars. A white dwarf or F star secondary will be detected by the presence of its continuum in the far ultraviolet. If no companion is seen, the strength of the chromospheric and transition region emission features will help us to decide whether the stars are possible FK Comae stars or perhaps a new class of active stars.|Y
CCFJL|An Emission Measure Analysis of Stars Near the Transition Region Dividing Line|Jeffery L.|Linsky|Colorado|We request high dispersion, short wavelength IUE spectra for three of the stars beta Gem (K0III), alpha Tau (K5III), epsilon Gem (G81b) and beta Cam (G0Ib) with exposure times of 16 hours or greater. These data will allow the measurement of line profiles, widths and Doppler shifts as well as density sensitive and opacity sensitive line ratios. Models of chromospheric and transition region structure will be calculated by emission measure techniques and model atmosphere computations for optically thick resonance lines such as MgII h and k, including partial redistribution radiation transfer. The chromospheric models will be used to investigate the energy balance of the atmosphere and the nature of the energy deposition processes. These results will be considered in relation to the evolutionary status of the stars, and will be compared with the atmospheric model properties of other stars previously studied by the authors and their collaborators.|Y
CCFLH|A Study of Chromospheric Emission Decay in Old Stars|Lee W.|Hartmann|CFA|Little Is known about the decay of chromospheric emission with age in old solartype stars (t > 5 Gyr). The Vaughan-Preston (1980) survey of Ca II chromospheric emission among stars in the solar neighborhood suggests that chromospheric emission may not weaken significantly in stars older than the Sun. However, the true decline may be much larger than indicated by these data, as there may be large photospheric fluxes included in the observations.  We propose to observe a sample of weak-emission stars from the Vaughan-Preston survey for Mg II emission with IUE. The photospheric contribution is much less at Mg II than it is at Ca II, and so we will obtain a clearer indication of chromospheric activity from the high dispersion spectra. We also propose to survey  20 stars in the spectral type range F5-G0 for which Twarog (1980b) has obtained estimates of ages and metallicities, in an effort to trace the decay of emission with age among very old dwarfs.|Y
CCFMZ|IUE Survey of Hyades Stars, Part IV: The K and M Dwarfs|Marie-Christin|Zolcinski|W Connecticut|We propose to extend the observations that we previously carried out on IUE of chromospheric and transition region lines in main sequence stars in the Hyades cluster. Observations of the Hyades cluster with the Einstein Observatory and with IUE have uncovered a high level of coronal X-Ray emission and similarly high fluxes of chromospheric and transition region lines compared to the Sun. To date, we have determined the differential emission measure for seven Hyades dwarfs of spectral type F to G. The characteristics of those stars are generally consistent with a coronal loop model similar to the one used in the case of the Sun although, according to the Einstein observations, their X-Ray luminosity is at least 30 times larger than the solar one. We wish now to extend this analysis to the K and M dwarfs of the Hyades Cluster in order to constrain the stellar parameters for those late type dwarfs. This will enable us to test the coronal loop model and obtain the stellar characteristics of stars of high X-Ray luminosity along the main sequence in a star cluster of known age and composition.|Y
CCFSW|Coordinated Magnetic and Chromospheric/Coronal Synoptic Observations|Simon P.|Worden|Air Force|We propose to obtain time-resolved, coordinated observations of magnetic flux and the associated coronal emission as well as chromospheric and transition region line emission for selected active chromospheric stars. The unique data to be obtained in this program will provide a crucial input to theories that describe the heating of stellar chromospheres and coronae. In essence, the results to be acquired through the observations will establish a preliminary empirical relationship between stellar photospheric magnetic field strengths and magnetic flux, stellar coronal field strength and emission, and stellar outer atmospheric line emission. We are presently utilizing demonstrated methods to directly detect magnetic fields on stellar surfaces. We are also able to deduce coronal field strengths from X-ray or radio observations. Magnetic results indicate the existence of strong (a few kilogauss) fields that may cover up to 80% of the stellar surface. Moreover, these fields are observed to rapidly (2-3 days) vary in surface coverage, suggesting a single large magnetic spot complex on only one hemisphere of the star. We therefore propose a coordinated IUE ground-based synoptic program to obtain chromospheric-transition region data (with IUE), and photospheric and coronal magnetic field and flux measurements (ground-based observations) for several stars that exhibit rapidly varying surface field coverages over their rotational periods.  Our IUE observing pattern will primarily consist of low dispersion, SWP observations and high-dispersion, LWR exposures. These data will be obtained simultaneously (or near simultaneously) with ground-based optical, IR and radio observations. The ground-based data will be used to infer magnetic field strengths and flux in the photosphere and corona. We also require that the IUE shifts be scheduled every third day to insure that we examine the entire stellar surface over 10-15 day rotational periods. We require two separate observing periods in order to access all objects in the target list from ground-based observing sites.|Y
CCFTA|The Hydrogen Emission of Active Red Dwarfs|Thomas R.|Ayres|Colorado-LASP|A number of low-dispersion studies of the emission-line dwarf M stars with IUE have revealed that their ultraviolet emissions share the enormous enhancement over quiet Sun levels typical of their coronal soft X-ray intensities. In fact, the visually very faint red dwarf AU Mic (M1.6e) is so bright in the far-ultraviolet region that highdispersion IUE spectra have been obtained successfully. These measurements further corroborate the notion that the dMe stars are heavily covered by intense magnetic activity, although the most pronounced effects appear to be confined to the multi-million degree corona. Indeed, an important new model for the lower atmospheres of the dMe stars proposed by L. Cram suggests that the 6,000 K chromospheric layers in fact are heated largely by XUV emission from the overlying corona, rather than by hydrodynamical effects. If this model is correct, the red dwarfs provide an opportunity to study a significant physical phenomenon that is thought to operate on the Sun only during the most intense flares.  In this regard, the previous studies of the red dwarfs with IUE have overlooked the most important feature of the far-ultraviolet spectrum for elucidating the X-ray heating scenario: the Ly-alpha resonance line of neutral hydrogen. Owing to the substantial recombination of hydrogen throughout the XUV irradiated layers of the dMe chromosphere, the Ly-alpha emission is anticipated to be considerably brighter than ordinarily would be expected from a more solar-like star, where the H I emission is governed largely by collisional excitation at conductive interfaces between the chromosphere and corona.  I therefore propose a program to obtain short exposures of the farultraviolet Ly-alpha emission of a representative sample of dMe stars in order to test the Cram X-ray heating hypothesis. In fact, the predicted Ly-alpha exposure times are so short that the program is suitable for NASA high radiation time. Furthermore, I intend to coordinate the IUE observations with ground-based measurements of Ca II, the H I Balmer series and other chromospheric emission lines in the optical region. The main objective is to obtain a complete set of chromospheric diagnostics to constrain the numerical models that will he utilized to test the Cram hypothesis or other possible mechanisms for energizing the red dwarf chromospheres.|Y
CCFTS|A Study of Yellow Giants in the Hertzsprung Gap|Theodore|Simon|Hawaii|Ultraviolet spectra obtained with IUE have established that the cool half of the HR diagram can be divided into two regions, with a "dividing line" roughly vertical through spectral type K1 III. To the left, yellow giants earlier than K1 III generally show evidence for chromospheres, transition regions, coronae, and weak winds. To the right, the red giants and supergiants show spectroscopic evidence for chromospheres and cool winds, but no evidence for material hotter than 10,000 K. It is the goal of this proposal to determine whether a "dividing line" also exists near the blue edge of the Hertzsprung Gap, coinciding with the onset of stellar convection zones. A previous study by Bohm-Vitense and Dettmann included three F5 II-III stars, and none showed evidence of high temperature lines indicative of hot transition regions and chromospheres. A related goal is to understand the observed wide range of transition region line strengths of the yellow giants (G5-8 111). One possible explanation is that the progenitors of the yellow giants with bright emission lines are 2-3 M(sun) stars which leave the main sequence as rapid rotators.|Y
CCFWW|Coronal Effects on the Winds of Early Type Stars|Wayne L.|Waldron|Delaware|The location of the source of X-ray emission from early type stars is presently unknown. The base coronal model predicts that the ultraviolet line ratios of NV/CIV and SiIV/CIV vary in opposite senses when subjected to changes in either coronal emission measure, coronal temperature, or mass loss rate., This behavior and its application to understanding variability in ultraviolet lines will be discussed. A search for this predicted variability will be conducted using existing IUE data.|Y
CCGAD|Chromospheres in Metal Deficient Giant Stars|Andrea K.|Dupree|CFA|we propose to measure the chromospheric transition Mg II in four red giant stars in globular clusters to define the radiative energy low and structure of the chromosphere in a population of known ages and specific metallicities. Simultaneous high resolution spectroscopy at H-alpha can reveal signatures of mass flow for correlation with chromospheric emission levels.|Y
CCGAS|Properties of a Rapidly Rotating DME Star & of H-Alpha Anomalous Low-Mass Stars|Andrew|Skumanich|HAO-NCAR|The issue of the effect of ultra-high rotation without attendant tidal effects on chromospheric and transition region signatures of dynamo activity in cool stars is to be examined by the observation of a recently discovered (Young, Skumanich and Harlan (1983), hereafter YSH83) rapidly rotating single dMe field star. In addition the chromospheric and transition region properties of stars found to be in a transition H-alpha emission state, i.e. between dMe and dM. YSH83 but with strong Ca+ chromospheres, will be determined. These observations will allow further study of the rotationactivity laws governing dynamo behaviour in solar-like stars as well as supplying needed constraints on chromospheric models for these stars.|Y
CCGCI|An Archival Investigation of the Chromospheres of the T Tauri Stars|Catherine L.|Imhoff|CSC|We would like to use archival data on the T Tauri stars to extend our study of the chromospheres and coronae of these stars. In our previous work, we have found that the surface fluxes for the chromospheric and transitionregion emission lines are very high. The MgII and far-ultraviolet emission lines typically account for 0.1% of the star's luminosity. If the T Tauri stars are compared to other active chromospheric late-type stars, it is evident that their coronal X-rays are underluminous. In some of the T Tauri stars we find that the high temperature transition-region lines, such as CIV and NV, are weakened and no HeII is detected. We believe that for these stars there is a real absence of high temperature material in the atmospheres.  There is no good reason to believe that the T Tauri atmospheres are a simple extrapolation of those in more evolved stars. Several effects could be at work in these very young stars that would not be found in older stars. It is therefore important to examine carefully all the available data on the ultraviolet spectra before characterizing the chromospheres of these stars.  By using the available archival data, we can double the sample of stars for which we have derived surface fluxes and examined chromospheric diagnostics. In addition, we can correct some early erroneous line identifications and fluxes which have been published. In so doing, we can better address the questions raised by our earlier research, concerning such issues as the apparent weakening of the high temperature lines, the association of HeII with coronal X-rays, and correlations or lack thereof between lower chromospheric and transition region lines. The source of the variability of the T Tauri stars will also be addressed by analysis of spectra obtained for a few stars at different epochs. Where possible, we will compare our observational results to models of deep, dense chromospheres.|Y
CCGDG|Flare-Like Activity in Single G, K, and M Stars|David M.|Gibson|New Mexico Tech|We propose to examine the IUE Archive to obtain information on the frequency and energy of flares or flare-like events on single late-type stars which have not been expressly monitored for such activity. In particular, we will examine the low-dispersion spectra of those G and K I-V and M I-III stars which have three or more SWP and/or LWR exposures and compare their chromospheric line fluxes, as appropriate. The resultant variations, or lack thereof, would support, or reject, the hypothesis that flaring or other less energetic chromospheric activity is occurring on stars of these classes at hitherto unsuspected levels.|Y
CCGDS|Chromospheres & Transition Regions of Stars in the Ursa Major Group|David R.|Soderblom|CFA|The Ursa Major Group ("UMaG") is one of the few clusters accessible to IUE. From ground-based observations, I have determined which of the solar-type stars (F7V to K3V) that have been assigned to this group on kinematical grounds are indeed real members on spectroscopic grounds. I wish to observe these bona fide UMaG members with IUE to determine the state of a typical solar-mass star at the age of UMaG (3 x 10^8 years), as well as to determine the variation of the chromospheres and transition regions with spectral type at this age. This information will provide a set of data for stars of known age, useful for understanding the variation of chromospheric and transition region emissions with age and mass in late-type dwarfs.|Y
CCGFF|Dispersion in the Rotation-Activity Relations|Francis C.|Fekel|Vanderbilt|We propose to examine the spread or dispersion in the rotation-activity relations and examine one possible cause for such a dispersion, rotational modulation of emission line fluxes. Of the two most important observable parameters for active chromosphere stars, rapid rotation and depth of convection zone, we plan to bold the first constant in our sample and examine the second. Our main-sequence binaries, all with periods of two days will be observed on successive days to determine whether rotational modulation is an important contributor to observed differences in chromospheric activity levels. A second possible result will be the determination of the spectral type on the main-sequence at which a rotational velocity of 25 km s^-1 is sufficient to produce a chromospherically active star. A secondary program will be a search for hot companions in these stars.|Y
CCGGS|An Ultraviolet Study of the Chromospheres of M67 Giants|Graeme|Smith|CFA|We propose to obtain long-wavelength, low dispersion spectra of the seven brightest giants in the old disk open cluster M67. The motivation for this project is to determine whether the Mg II flux correlates wen with the evolutionary state of an old red giant, as reflected for the cluster members by the B-V color. Any scatter in the Mg II flux at a given B-V could indicate the presence of activity cycles among even the late K giants, as may be the case for the much younger Hyades KO giants, and the G-type field giants.|Y
CCGJL|Differences in Chromospheres of M Giants & Supergiants as a Function of Dust/Gas Ratio|Jeffery L.|Linsky|Colorado|Observational evidence indicates that Ca II emission, and thus perhaps all chromospheric indicators, are inversely correlated with the dust/gas ratio in luminous M stars. We propose to study the differences in chromospheric activity in a sample of cool stars with a range of dust/gas properties using the unique ultraviolet chromospheric diagnostics available to IUE. A combination of archival and new, seventh year LWR-LO observations will allow us to investigate in detail the relationships between total chromospheric activity, as indicated by lines of C II, Fe II, Mg I, and Mg II, and the dust level in the outer regions of a star. Specifically, we shall determine 1) whether the inverse Ca II-dust/gas correlation can be generalized to an inverse correlation of general chromospheric activity and dust-gas ratio, 2) whether the strength of the emission in any of the uv features correlates with the dust/gas ratio, and 3) whether the fraction of the total chromospheric flux emitted in the various lines (and thus the relative radiative cooling rates) changes with varying dust/gas ratio.  In contrast to chromospheric emission lines visible from the ground, the lines visible with IUE are intrinsically strong and formed at a variety of temperatures and opacities, and thus heights in the chromosphere. Thus, these IUE data, unlike the existing ground-based data, will allow us to draw conclusions regarding the interaction between dust grains and the amount of warm chromospheric gas at various levels throughout the chromospheres of cool, luminous stars.  Since the lifetime of the IUE spacecraft is limited, it is important to complete this important survey program in the near future in order to guide planning for Space Telescope observations of luminous cool stars and to provide a firm observational basis for understanding the energy balance in the atmospheres of these stars.|Y
CCGKH|Survey of Chromospheres in F-G-K Dwarfs|Kenneth L.|Hallam|NASA/GSFC|We propose to study the means and variability of ultraviolet chromospheric emission in lower-main-sequence stars, utilizing IUE archival spectra of frequently observed stars. The variability will be analyzed in terms of short-term rotational modulation and both long- and short-term intrinsic variability over a range of spectral types and activity levels. The purpose is to provide a data base on variable and inhomogeneous structures in the chromospheres of solartype stars. This information can then be compared to localized phenomena observed in the solar atmosphere in order to extend the application of solar physics into the stellar domain. The investigation will use flux-extraction and time-series analysis methods developed and tested by us through a series of previous observational programs.|Y
CCGMG|The Transition Regions of X-Ray Emitting Main-Sequence A Stars|Mark S.|Giampapa|NOAO|We propose to obtain low dispersion, large aperture SWP and high dispersion, large aperture LWR observations of two (2) X-ray emitting, single main-sequence A stars:: HR 7160 (A8V, log Lx = 29) and HD 117721 (A3V, log Lx = 30.4). These stars were strongly detected by HEAO-B (Golub et al. 1983) and, unlike many of the other A stars detected by Einstein, these objects appear to be single stars. lie thus propose to verify the presence of hot plasma in these stars by searching for the occurrence of transition region and chromospheric line emission. The detection of transition region line emission (i.e. C IV, N V, Si IV, etc.) in main sequence A stars would have important implications for (1) our understanding of the precise location on the main sequence of the onset of convection, and (2) the role of convection zone depth and surface turbulence in the generation of stellar chromospheric and coronal activity.|Y
CCGSB|Flares & Activity in FF Aquarii & Lambda Andromedae|Sallie L.|Baliunas|CFA|The serendipitous detection of an extremely energetic flare on the activechromosphere G8 IV-III star lambda And provides a unique opportunity for comparative flare studies. Our long-term investigations of A And and FF Aqr, a binary with a G8 III star reveals that the chromospheric activity in FF Aqr is more intense and extreme than in lambda And, primarily because the G8 III star FF Aqr rotates six times faster than lambda And. Some of the UV surface fluxes from FF Aqr and 20-50 times those of A And. In  photometric U-band monitoring reveals flaring on the G8 III star in FF Aqr as bright as a magnitude and as frequently as once an hour. We expect, therefore, a flare more luminous than observed on lambda And. Such a flare would provide strong and extreme constraints for theoretical models of stellar flares.|Y
CCGTS|The Evolution of Stellar Chromospheres|Theodore|Simon|Hawaii|59 Vir (GO V) and 31 Com (GO III) are among the youngest G stars for which high dispersion spectra can be obtained with the short-wavelength camera of IUE. Their ages are estimated to be 0.2 Gyr (31 Com is a member of the Coma cluster). 59 Vir was observed at low resolution in a study of the relation between ultraviolet chromospheric activity and age in solar dwarf stars. 31 Com was observed as an example of a young yellow giant making its first crossing of the Hertzsprung Gap. Their spectra show bright chromospheric and transition region emission lines.  We request observing time in this proposal to secure doubleshift (up to 16 hours) high dispersion exposures of each star with the SWP camera. These observations will allow us to resolve the profiles of individual chromospheric and transition region emission lines. From radiative transfer calculations, emission measure analyses, and line flux ratios, we will derive temperature, density, and velocity field models in the chromosphere and transition region. We will investigate the energy balance of these atmospheres in order to compare their non-thermal energy requirements with results derived for older solar-type dwarfs and more highly evolved yellow and red giants. With precautions to ensure the fidelity of the wavelength scale, we will also look far differential velocity shifts between TR and chromospheric lines, which may arise from global atmospheric circulation patterns. We have shown in previous work that redshifted TR lines are most clearly seen in giant stars and that the downflows causing the line shifts may affect the energy balance of giant atmospheres. As one of the very few normal G giants whose spectrum can be studied at high dispersion, 31 Com is important to such studies.|Y
CCHDM|Statistical Study of Mass Loss Fluctuations|Dermott J.|Mullan|Delaware|In this archival proposal, we wish to extend our statistical study of fluctuations in chromospheric and mass loss processes in cool giants. In previous and current work, we have used multi-epoch MgII h and k profiles plus "warm" lines in the far UV to obtain unique information on rotation periods for 8 stars, as well as modelling Alfven-wave driven winds. Our results to date represent extraction of only the first level of information in the archives, using integrated emission fluxes. But already, our work has indicated the wealth of information available on cool giants in archives, which now contain multi-epoch data for 100 cool giants.  Here we propose to extend our work and extract the next level of information in the IUE archives: we propose to study variations in individual features within the various line profiles. In particular, we propose to search for correlations between variations in spectral lines which are formed at as many different levels of the stellar atmosphere as possible (from the chromosphere to the wind). Such correlations would contain valuable information on how the mechanical energy deposition in the atmosphere is distributed between the chromosphere and the wind. Such information should in turn point the way towards defining the physical mechanisms by means of which cool giants lose mass: there is at present no consensus on those mechanisms.|Y
CCHHJ|High-Resolution Spectroscopy of the Cool Carbon Star HD 20234|Hollis R.|Johnson|Indiana University|The IUE satellite will be used to obtain high-resolution LWR spectra of the cool carbon star HD 20234 (= HR 977 - TW Hor). From these spectra, accurate identification of spectral features (both absorption and emission) will be made. High resolution observations in the long wavelength region will be used to study profiles of the Mg II h and k lines for evidence of circumstellar features and possible mass outflow. The width of the emission core may yield the stellar luminosity (by the Wilson-Bappu effect). If the C II lines at A2325 can be obtained, the electron density will be deduced. The wavelength dependence of the ultraviolet opacity will be studied. Attempts will be made to deduce any other information about the outer atmosphere and chromosphere of this fascinating carbon star. A model chromosphere will be constructed to match the observations.|Y
CCHJE|Ultraviolet Colors of Late-Type Stars with Different Amounts of Chromospheric Activity|Joel A.|Eaton|Indiana University|We present evidence that suggests many different varieties of late-type stars should have observable effects of non-radiative heating in their ultraviolet continua. A program is proposed to investigate these effects and to see how important they are. We will proceed by using ultraviolet colors of the form (lambda-V) to compare the ultraviolet surface brightness of stars with the same effective temperature but different amounts of Mg II chromospheric emission. We are specifically interested in determining whether there is a difference in the non-radiative heating in the upper photosphere for stars with a) different rotation, b) different age, c) different surface gravity. If it can be established that the expected effects of non-radiative heating exist, we will investigate the modifications of stellar atmospheres required to give them. Model atmospheres for cool stars, which have been calculated routinely at Indiana University over the last decade, will be used to calculate the ultraviolet flux without non-radiative heating. They will be modified through elevation of the outer photospheric temperature to give the observed differences in UV colors. These results will be used to measure the relation between chromospheric line losses and losses due to non-radiative heating of the upper photosphere.|Y
CCHJL|Stellar Winds in Cool Giants and Supergiants|Jeffrey L.|Linsky|Colorado - JILA|We propose to study the properties of stellar winds in cool giants and supergiants using both archive and new high-dispersion, long-wavelength spectra. We aim to investigate the dependence of wind velocity and mass loss rate as a function of spectral type and luminosity, concentrating particularly on the K giants. We will use as primary diagnostic tools, the blue-shifted absorption features seen in the Mg II h and k lines of stars in this region of the H-R Diagram.|Y
CCHMG|Coordinated Magnetic and Chromospheric Observations of Stars|Mark S.|Giampapa|NOAO|We propose to obtain time-resolved, coordinated observations of magnetic flux and the associated chromospheric and transition region line emissions for selected active chromosphere stars. The unique data to be obtained in this program will provide a crucial input to theories that describe the heating of stellar atmospheres. In essence, the results to be acquired through the observations will establish a preliminary empirical relationship between stellar photospheric magnetic field strengths and magnetic flux, and stellar outer atmospheric line emission. We are presently utilizing demonstrated methods to directly detect magnetic fields on stellar surfaces. Magnetic results indicate the existence of strong (a few kilogauss) fields that may cover up to 80% of the stellar surface. Moreover, these fields are observed to rapidly (2-3 days) vary in surface coverage, suggesting a single large magnetic spot complex on only one hemisphere of the star. We therefore propose a coordinated IUE/ground-based synoptic program to obtain chromospherictransition region data (with IUE), and photospheric magnetic field and flux measurements (ground-based observations) for several stars that exhibit rapidly varying surface field coverages over their rotational periods.  Our IUE observing pattern will primarily consist of low dispersion, SWP observations and high-dispersion, LWR exposures. These data will be obtained simultaneously (or near simultaneously) with ground-based optical and IR observations. The ground-based data will be used to infer magnetic field strengths and flux in the photosphere. We also require that the IUE shifts be scheduled every third day to insure that we examine the entire stellar surface over 10-15 day rotational periods. We require two separate observing periods in order to have access to all objects in the target list from ground-based observing sites.|Y
CCHTA|A Far-Ultraviolet Echelle Survey of Young F Stars in the URSa Major Cluster|Thomas R.|Ayres|Colorado-LASP|Late-type stars nearly universally exhibit the spectroscopic symptoms of solarlike chromospheric and coronal activity, while the early-type stars are decidedly non-solar in their outer atmospheric properties. The boundary between the solar-like and non-solar behavior occurs among the F-type stars, where shallow convective envelopes first develop. Within this critical boundary, the very young, fast-rotating F-type stars are an important sub-class of their own: It is among the fast rotating late-type stars that the most intense chromospheric and coronal phenomena are observed, presumably related to extremes of magnetic dynamo action.  It is our intent, therefore, to carry previous high-dispersion, farultraviolet studies of late-type stars to the important sub-class represented by the very young F-types. The region of the stellar outer atmosphere that is perhaps most sensitive to the transition from non-solar to solar-like behavior is the chromosphere-corona 'transition zone' (TZ), with characteristic temperatures between 2XJ04 and a few x lO^5 K. High-dispersion observations of TZ lines in the far-UV spectra of active G and K stars have revealed the existence of important dynamical phenomena--systematic downflows and supersonic 'turbulence'-as well as providing detailed information concerning TZ densities. However, even the brightest of the young F stars (which are in the nearby Ursa Major Cluster and Stream) are too faint to observe with high S/N at the most prominent TZ emission -- C IV 1548 -- in high dispersion. Therefore, we will focus our attention on the longwavelength end of the farultraviolet spectrum: The SWP camera is most sensitive near 1900A, and the region contains important emissions of Si III] and C III], as well as Si II at somewhat shorter wavelengths, all of which are superimposed on a bright photospheric continuum.|Y
CCHTS|The Nature of Stellar Active Regions|Theodore|Simon|Hawaii|Observations will be obtained at four different phases over the 9.4 day rotation period of the 65 V star Kappa Ceti to follow the modulation of its chromospheric and transition region lines and the brightness temperature of its 1700 - 1750 A continuum. The observations will be used to test the proposition that the intense transition region emission of young, rapidly-rotatingm solar-type stars originates in stellar flares and that their chromospheric emission comes from plages and the chromospheric network in magnetically-undisturbed regions. Archive data from modulation studies in previous episodes have observational  uncertainties > 10%; steps will be taken here to reduce uncertainties to ~5% for example, the chromospherically-inactive star Tau Ceti will be observed along with Kappa Ceti in order to monitor instrumental changes.|Y
CCIFF|UV Observations of Single Chromospherically Active Giants|Francis C.|Fekel|Vanderbilt|From a previous IUE project a new group of chromospherically active stars, single active giants believed to have evolved from early type stars, has been identified. We will observe 7 probable members to determine whether they are members of this group or FK Com stars. A second goal is to compare the activity of these single stars with those of binaries having similar properties.|Y
CCIJL|Chromospheric & Coronal Heating for a Statistically Complete Sample of K Stars|Jeffrey L.|Linsky|Colorado - JILA|The overall energy balance of the outer atmospheres of solar- and late-type dwarf stars appears to undergo a dramatic shift as one proceeds from spectral types G to M. The solar type stars have an outer atmosphere in which the radiative losses are dominated by the chromosphere; in the latertype stars the corona dominates.  We propose to study the nature of this transition, and the implications for the heating mechanisms, using a carefully selected volume-limited sample of single, X-ray selected K dwarfs. Low resolution, long wavelength IUE observations of the MgII resonance lines will allow us to determine the radiative losses of the chromospheres. These losses can be correlated with the coronal losses; trends dependent on age and effective temperature can be used to constrain models for the non-radiative heating that forms the chromospheres and coronae of these stars. For a subset (consisting of the brightest) of these stars, we will also measure the luminosities of such transition region lines as CIV and CII, enabling us to form a comprehensive picture of the radiative losses of stellar plasmas between 10^4 K and 10^7 K as a function of age and effective temperature. This information will serve to further constrain models of non-radiative heating in late-type stars.|Y
CCIKJ|UV Study of the Chromospheres of M67 Giants|Kenneth|Janes|Boston|We propose to obtain long-wavelength, low dispersion spectra of the seven brightest giants in the old disk open cluster M67. The motivation for this project is to determine whether the Mg II flux correlates well with the evolutionary state of an old red giant, as reflected in the cluster members by the B-V color. Any scatter in the Mg II flux at a given B-V could indicate the presence of activity cycles among late K giants, as may be the case for the much younger Hyades KO giants and the G-type field giants.|Y
CCINE|The Mass of the Classical Cepheid SU Cygni|Nancy Remage|Evans|CSC|The orbital velocity amplitudes of a blue main sequence companion of a classical Cepheid can be measured from IUE spectra, as well as the velocity amplitude of the Cepheid itself. The mass ratio which results is the only direct observational information we have about the masses of classical Cepheids to test our understanding of evolutionary theory.  SU Cygni has the largest orbital amplitude of the binary Cepheids, and consequently, potentially the most accurate mass ratio. From 8 IUE high dispersion long wavelength spectra we have determined the mass ratio of the Cepheid to the companions to be 1.099 +/- 0.022. Unfortunately, the IUE spectra revealed that the companion is itself a short period binary. This means that most of the uncertainty in the Cepheid mass we derive arises not from the orbital solution, but from the uncertainty in the mass of the companions, which is estimated from the fluxes in the low dispersion spectra. From the high dispersion spectra we have derived the short period orbit (with a standard deviation of 2.3 km/sec per observation). A velocity from the third component has not been convincingly identified; it is not even clear which of the blue stars produces the velocity signal which is measured. To answer this question and search for the velocity from the third star, we would like to obtain two SWP high dispersion spectra at velocity extrema of the short period orbit. This will result in an error in the Cepheid mass as small as 0.2 solar masses.|Y
CCJAB|Chromospheric and Transition Region Structure of AK SCO and V351 ORI|Alexander|Brown|Colorado|We propose to obtain long LWP high dispersion and deep SWP low dispersion spectra of the intermediate mass pre-main sequence (PMS) stars AK Sco (F5Ve) and V351 Ori (A7111e). Observation of these stars forms part of our ongoing investigation of intermediate mass PMS stars, which aims to study the chromospheric and transition region structure of these stars and how this structure changes as the stars evolve towards the main sequence. The chromospheric and transition region emission line fluxes and the emission line profiles of MgII (also CII] and FeII for AK Sco) will be used to model the outer atmospheric structure using a combination of emission measure analysis, co-moving-frame PRD radiative transfer calculations and probability of escape analysis of lines with common upper levels.|Y
CCJEB|High Resolution Studies of F and G Star Transition Layer Lines|Erika|Bohm-Vitense|University of Washington|The question, which heating mechanism is responsible for the heating of the transition layers and stellar coronae. is still an open one. We have now developed a theory for stellar transition layers which are homogeneous. at least in sectors. which does permit to determine from the observed emission measures the amount of mechanical energy input in the lower transition layer and determine the boundary condition Pe(T) for the upper transition layer.  The mechanical flux and the damping length for this flux for the upper part of the transition layer can be determined from the emission measures in the upper transition zone and from the coronal temperature. or, if no emission measures for the upper transition zone are available the emission measure determined from the coronal X-ray emission can be used instead. though less reliably. Using this method we found that the lower transition layers of the sun and Procyon are probably heated by shock wave heating. The upper transition layer of Procyon also seems to be heated by shock waves. while in the sun in the upper part of the transition layer the damping length is too long to be consistent with shock wave heating. We want to study whether and where in the late F star region a transition from shock wave heating to MHD wave heating of the upper transition layer occurs.|Y
CCJFF|UV Observations of Single Chromospherically Active Giants|Francis C.|Fekel|Vanderbilt|This proposal is a continuation of a previous one to determine line fluxes for single chromospherically active giant stars. These fluxes will be compared with UV line fluxes of evolved binary systems to separate possible effects of duplicity and evolution.|Y
CCJTS|The Onset of Chromospheric Activity|Theodore|Simon|NASA/GSFC|The location on the main sequence where chromospheric and coronal activity begins is a vital observational constraint on models of activity, structure, and convection in stars. Existing observational. data, primarily observations of the D3 absorption line in a limited sample of stars, indicate that this occurs near B - V = 0.28, but limited X-ray and UV data suggest that it may occur significantly earlier. We propose to refine the determination of this high temperature boundary for the onset of activity by observing stars in the range 0.19 < B - V < 0.36 to search for stellar Lyman Alpha emission. Lyman Alpha is expected to be 20 - 50 times stronger than the other UV diagnostics, such as C IV and C II, that have been used in previous attempts to determine the high temperature boundary to chromospheric activity on the lower half of the main sequence. The background photospheric continuum, which greatly hinders the detection of C IV and C II in the late-A stars, is completely absent near Lyman Alpha. The accurate determination of this boundary will provide an important constraint on acoustic heating models and dynamo-driven models of stellar activity.|Y
CCKDS|Coronal Mass Ejections from a Young K0 Dwarf Star|David R.|Soderblom|STScI|We propose to carry out a joint ESA NASA IUE and ground-based spectroscopic study of the rapid ly rotating (P = 0.514 day), bright (V =6.9). young K0 dwarf HD 36705 (= AB Doradus). Cameron and Robinson have recently discovered prominence-like clouds of neutral material in the outer corona of this star. We intend to determine the column densities and temperatures of the clouds from the widths of the Mg II h and k absorption features produced as those clouds transit the stellar disk. We can thus determine the masses of these clouds, which are ejected from the star about twice per day, and hence their effectiveness as a magnetic braking mechanism in very young, low-mass, main sequence stars. Between Mg II observations. we will obtain short-wavelength spectra to monitor the variability in other chromospheric and transition region line emissions over six consecutive stellar rotations.|Y
CCKTA|The Debit Side of the Chromospheric Energy Budget|Thomas R.|Ayres|Colorado - CASA|The chromosphere is a thick, hot (< 10' K), nonradiatively heated layer of the stellar outer atmosphere, immediately above the photosphere, which is found in virtually all stars of late spectral type. Despite considerable observational and theoretical effort in the particularly favorable case of the Sun, the origin of the chromosphere - and its wealth of fine structure largely remains a mystery. Small-scale magnetic "flux tubes" are thought to play a significant role in imposing physical structure on the chromosphere, and the heating of the gas is believed to be associated with the deposition of wave energy - acoustic or various magnetic modes propagating up from the deep convection zone; however, there is considerably more speculation in the field than hard facts, despite literally decades of work (in the solar case, at least).  A fundamental question in this regard is the relative importance of various atomic and ionic species in cooling the chromospheric gas. Not only is an understanding of the detailed constituents of the plasma cooling function important to theoretical modelling efforts, but also to observational efforts to measure the radiative losses of stellar chromospheres across the HR diagram: identification of the most important species, and their relative contributions, permits observers to concentrate on a few critical spectral intervals, and correct their measurements for the additional species that are not directly detected.  The present proposal seeks to assess the relative importance of several species in the chromospheric energy budget by numerically comparing the vacuumultraviolet energy distributions of pairs of stars of similar spectral type and luminosity class, but widely different "activity" levels. The ultimate goal is to examine the gross properties of chromospheres as a function of fundamental stellar attributes like spectral type and luminosity class: by moving away from the perhaps too-familiar solar example, one might be able to develop new clues into the nature of the elusive chromospheric heating processes.|Y
CCKTT|Chromospheres of Delta Scuti Stars|Terry J.|Teays|CSC IUE|Observing time is requested with IUE to continue a study of the chromospheres of dwarf Cepheids which was begun during the ninth episode. Although several studies have been made of the ultraviolet spectra of such stars, the phase coverage is random for all except Rho Pup and Beta Cas (which was studied by the proposers in the 9th and 10th episodes). The current project is intended to follow the variation of the emission throughout several consecutive pulsation cycles. The observations of Beta Cas that we presently have seem to show that while the emission in the cores of the Mg II h and k lines is variable in time, it is not simply related to the pulsation cycle. We need further observing time to extend this study to some additional interesting stars, and expand the database, so that understanding of the stars as a class may be achieved. The final goal of this work is to gain insight into both the excitation of chromospheres by pulsation and the details of the pulsation itself.|Y
CCLTS|The Dependence of Chromospheric Activity Upon Mass, Age, and Rotation|Theodore|Simon|Hawaii|Measurements of rotational velocities and rotation periods of G-M stars in young clusters have led to the discovery of a number of very rapidly rotating stars. These stars rotate many times faster than stars of similar mass in the field. It is thought that these rapid rotators may be recent arrivals on the main sequence and may have been spun up by contraction along their pre-main sequence evolutionary tracks. This rapid rotation apparently decays to much slower rates on time scales very much shorter than those implied by simple magnetic braking laws such as Skumanich's square-root law. The time scale required for this loss of angular momentum seems to be an order of magnitude longer for dM stars than dG stars. If this spindown is caused by magnetic braking, then there may be a feedback mechanism that governs stellar dynamos, which serves to control both chromospheric/coronal heating and the rate at which angular momentum is lost. The purpose of this proposal is to try to understand this mechanism by exploring the connection between the time decay of rotation and the time decay of chromospheric activity. I am proposing to measure the Mg II emission of a sample of G, K, and M stars in 5 clusters and also of a group of pre-main sequence stars. These observations will be used to study the evolution of chromospheric activity with age over a broad range in mass for stars which are a few million years old to those which are a few hundred million years old. The observations will provide a unique dataset relating to stellar activity that will be of great value for many years to come, even after Space Telescope is launched.|Y
CCMAB|Long-Term MG II Variability of Hybird-Chromosphere Stars|Alexander|Brown|Colorado|We propose to continue our investigation of the Mg II emission line variability of hybridchromosphere stars (HYGJL, LGHJL, CSJAB, TTKAB), thereby significantly extending the temporal coverage by IUE of the variability of hybrid star outer atmospheric structure. We shall study variability in both Mg II emission line fluxes and wind absorption features. In our previous studies we have optimally sampled variations on timescales of months to years, and at least for some stars, e.g. alpha TrA, on timescales down to less than a week. Our earlier work has shown that the dominant timescale for variations in the Mg II emission line flux is several years and that the fluxes are not rotationally modulated with the periods previously proposed by Brosius et al. (1985). There is definite evidence for long-term variability at the 20-50% level. (The relative fluxes at a single epoch are accurate to 3% and the long-term stability of such measurements is 5%, based on data for the non-variable K giants Beta Gem and alpha Tau). While some of this variability shows as slow trends or chaotic short-term behaviour, some stars show slowly varying fluxes similar to the behaviour expected of stellar activity cycles. Only continued observation can show if this is indeed the case. The IUE data extend over the past 10 years and it would be foolish not to take the opportunity of extending this dataset while IUE is still operating. The Mg II wind absorptions are variable due to changes in the wind velocity but presently we see little correlation between this and the line flux variability. While the Ca II H and K and H-alpha lines provide complementary information to the Mg II spectra, these lines are less opaque and therefore do not have as strong a sensitivity to the wind properties, Ca II flux measurements, such as made by the Mt Wilson HK photometer, do not show how the line profile is changing only that the total flux of the line has changed.|Y
CCMBH|The Corona-Transition Region Relationship in Evolved Stars|Bernhard M.|Haisch|Lockheed|A key diagnostic of coronal structure on stars involves the simultaneous determination of radiative losses from all regions of the outer atmosphere extending from the chromosphere to the corona; virtually all prior comparison of X-ray and UV line fluxes suffered from the observations being made at different epochs. Simulations of the UV versus X-ray emission from the complete range of solar differential emission measures show a remarkably tight correlation (see Figs. 1 and 2 in this proposal; from Bruner and McWhirter 1988). The Einstein/IUE cool star study we are just completing shows virtually the same relationship (although with much more scatter) for the even most active, evolved stars which are structurally very different from the Sun: RS CVn's stars and single F, G, early-K giants. We expect that with simultaneous UV and X-ray measurements, this relationship can be tightened up to the extent that deviations from solar-like conditions will be detectable (if such is the case). We have used Einstein detections to assure that our targets will be ROSAT sources, and we have used the X-ray/C IV ratios expected from the "to be improved relationship" to estimate IUE exposure times. An improved X-ray vs. UV-line set of flux-flux correlations will allow us to more sensitively search for a "basal flux" of nonmagnetic chromospheric emission.|Y
CCMDS|Chromospheres and Transition Regions of Stars in the Ursa Major Group II|David R.|Soderblom|STScI|The Ursa Major Group is one of the few clusters accessible to IUE because its stars lie within the solar neighborhood. This program builds upon an earlier one to use data on the level of chromospheric emission in candidate members of this moving group to assess their membership, and then to study the group members as a cluster of stars. From this data it will be possible to study the intrinsic spread in levels of activity seen in young stars of the same age; this is of interest because the Ursa Major Group is intermediate in age to the Pleiades, which shows considerable spread, and the Hyades, which shows very little.  These data will also extend knowledge of chromospheres in a cluster to lower masses than heretofore possible by observing K and M dwarf stars thought to be Ursa Major Group members.|Y
CCMFB|Search for Lyman-Alpha and Chromospheric Emission in A and F Stars|Frederick C.|Bruhweiler|Catholic University|The understanding why A-stars have apparently different atmospheric structure than solar-like stars is a critical problem, both from the observational and theoretical points of view. In general A stars do not show evidences of the typical chromospheric and transition region indicators. However some of them, like Alpha Aql (A7V), Alpha Hyi (F0V). have been detected as X-ray sources, which implies the existence of a corona and therefore an external temperature rise. Following the first claim for the detection of Lymanalpha emission from Alpha Aql (Blanco, Catalano, and Marilli 1980) further long exposure SWP spectra had confirmed the existence of a chromosphere on that star. A semiempirical NLTE model for the chromosphere of Alpha Aql is being computed by our group based on the average Lyman-alpha profile obtained from our observations and archive spectra. A careful new procedure has been implemented to correct the observations for the geocoronal Lyman-alpha. This proposal should be considered a follow up of our previous IUE efforts through ESA mainly dedicated to the observation of Alpha Aql. Yet, we have detected Lyman-alpha emission from two more A-F stars, Alpha Cep (A7V) and Beta Tri A (F2V). We propose to reobserve Alpha Cep and Beta Tri A in order to get a Lyman-alpha profile with a reasonable S/N, and make new observations of Iota UMa (A7 V, vsin i= 150 km/sec) and Alpha Hyi (F0 V, vsin i= 150 km/sec). This will allow us to have a minimal useful sample of stars for studying the onset of chromospheric activity between A and F spectral types.|Y
CCMSB|Chromospheric Activity in F and G Subgiants|Suchitra C.|Balachandran|Sets Inc.|Recent observations by Simon and Drake (1989) show that the activity in early-F stars declines once these stars leave the main sequence to become cool subgiants. This decline in activity together with the rapid disappearance of fast rotators in cool subgiants (Gray and Nagar 1985) favors dynamo-related braking. There is insufficient activity data across the rotational break to determine if the decline in activity is equally abrupt. We propose to measure the activity levels in 16 stars spanning the subgiant rotational break to determine the range in effective temperature, and hence the timescale, over which the activity decline occurs. This will provide constraints on the theoretical explanation for dynamo-related braking.|Y
CCMTA|The IUE/Rosat Coronathon|Thomas R.|Ayres|Colorado - CASA|The impending all-sky survey by ROSAT, and the continuing health of the IUE, present a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity: namely to obtain vacuum-ultraviolet spectroscopy in coordination with X-ray and EUV photometry for large, unbiased samples of high-excitation celestial sources. A prominent class of such sources are the coronal F-K stars. By virtue of their magnetic (and in some cases acoustic) activity, such stars support hot gas in their outer atmospheres, which radiates strongly in the temperature ranges accessible to the ROSAT XRT (soft X-rays: 10^6 K) and WFC (EUV: 10^5 - 10^6 K); and to the IUE spectrometers (far-UV: 10^5 K [C IV]; mid-UV 10^4 K [Mg II]). While the past decade has witnessed major revolutions in our understanding of chromosphere-corona activity, thanks in large part to the continuing efforts of the IUE and earlier X-ray work by HEAO-1, EINSTEIN, and EXOSAT, there are a number of outstanding issues that can be settled only by obtaining an extensive coordinated database of multi-wavelength measurements of the coronal properties of stars, as free of observational bias as possible.  Accordingly, we have assembled a list of 76 F-K stars representing essentially complete samples down to specified magnitude limits; which satisfy a number of strict selection criteria; which should appear at very significant detection levels in the ROSAT survey; and which are readily observable by the IUE. We propose to obtain IUE SWP-LO and LWP-HI spectra during the few-day period when each target is scanned by ROSAT, and to conduct the exposures in a uniform, systematic manner. Our scientific goals include deriving accurate luminosity functions jointly for C IV and X-rays in nearly unbiased samples of coronal sources; examining structure in X-ray/C IV correlograms using near-simultaneous observations; assessing the longterm variability of many of the sample members which have been recorded previously by the MR, and exploring the EUV behavior of the coronal sources in the WFC survey to develop that critical spectral band as a diagnostic for 'cool' (10^5 K) coronae. Equally important, our CORNATHON will provide a context within which to examine the historical collection of largely nonsimultaneous X-ray/UV measurements of late-type stars, as well as to provide support for the pointed phase of the ROSAT mission.  Our team has a collective experience of over a half-century in observing late-type stars with the IUE, and we have actively participated in virtually all of the X-ray missions flown to date. Two of us will be working directly in the analysis of the XRT survey, and another on the WFC survey. A unique opportunity to explore late-type coronae awaits: a sample such as we have assembled will not magically appear out of a collection of smaller proposals. Let's do it right.|Y

CCNDB|Age Calibration of Mg II Chromospheric Emission|David|Burstein|Arizona State University|Chromospheric emission in the Mg II 2800A doublet is related to the ages of FGK dwarf stars. It has been shown that a low resolution IUE index for this feature (Mg2800) correlates well with traditional higher resolution indices of chromospheric activity, meaning that this age indicator can be applied over a much larger volume of space than these traditional methods. Preliminary evidence indicates that the Mg2800 index is sensitive to stellar ages up to 3 Gyr and perhaps beyond. We propose here to calibrate the age/metal abundance sensitivity of Mg2800 with IUE observations of - 30 stars, building on an earlier sample of - 80 stars we have observed or culled from the IUE Archive. This is part of a larger projected program that will include HST observations. If successful, our program will permit age calibration of stars as faint as V = 18, providing considerable new insights into the age/abundance/kinematical structure of the Galaxy.|Y
CCNTA|Coronathon Follow-On|Thomas R.|Ayres|Colorado - CASA|RIASS is a campaign to coordinate IUE spectroscopy of selected high-excitation celestial sources with the ROSAT all-sky survey (8/90 - 1/91). 1 and collaborators responded to that unique opportunity in the 13th Episode with a carefully-chosen sample of approx 80 F-K stars. Studies of the magnetically-engendered chromospheres and coronae of such stars particularly benefit from joint observations of far-UV emission lines (Tex approx 10^4 - 10^5 K) and broad-band soft X-ray fluxes (0.1-2 keV: Tex > 101 K).  Ultimately, half of our "Coronathon" targets were observed during RIASS. Here, I request additional IUE time to record far-UV spectra of two groups of stars from the original sample which were not observed during the campaign either: (1) because the target had not previously been observed by the IUE (thereby violating one of the central requirements of RIASS); or, (2) the star was too faint (at C IV 1549) given the limited observing time. Far-UV spectra of these two groups will complete (in a statistical sense) the IUE archival collection of specific key classes of late-type stars, thereby permitting a broad range of statistical studies of stellar coronae which heretofore have been frustrated by incomplete or highly-biased samples.|Y
CCNTS|Chromospheric Activity in the Hyades Cluster|Theodore|Simon|U Hawaii|Measurements of the rotation rates of G-M dwarfs in young clusters have shown there is a wide range in rotation speed at a given mass in a given cluster. The youngest clusters exhibit the widest dispersion in velocity over the broadest range in mass; the oldest clusters exhibit the smallest range in velocity confined to the lowest mass. There is some evidence that the spread in rotation rate among the youngest clusters is not due to an intracluster age spread, but reflects a dispersion in the angular momentum of stars when they first arrive on the ZAMS. IUE observations of the chromospheric Mg II emission tend to support the idea of a broad initial spread in both rotation and activity. The IUE data are in serious conflict with the square-root law proposed by Skumanich: for the most active young stars, chromospheric emission decays much more quickly than the relation predicts, while for the least active stars, it declines much more gradually than predicted. Therefore, no single empirical formula can describe the time decay of activity and rotation for each and every star. To help confirm this idea, I am proposing new observations of Mg II emission in the Hyades: observations of some slowly rotating dM stars to establish the reality of a spread in activity with a spread in rotation; and observations of dK stars to look for the chromospherically inactive stars that the square-root law says should be the descendants of the most slowly rotating and least active stars observed in the much younger Alpha Persei and Pleiades clusters. If the square-root law were correct, then the activity of some Hyades K stars should be comparable with that of the Sun. No such stars have yet been found, but a more exhaustive survey of activity in the Hyades is still needed to rule this possibility out.|Y

CCOTT|Short Period Type II Cepheids with Carbon Star Characteristics|Terry J.|Teays|CSC - IUE Observatory|We propose to conduct the first ultraviolet study of a small, but very puzzling group of stars: short period Type II Cepheids whose spectra exhibit carbon star characteristics. Stellar evolution theory predicts that short period (BL Her) stars should be evolving directly from the blue side of the horizontal branch, yet the mechanism for generating a carbon star is by dredge up during thermal pulses on the asymptotic giant branch. These contradictory requirements have not yet been resolved. Additionally, models for carbon stars still require generally higher masses than are expected for the BL Her stars, based on pulsation theory. As a star cools, deep convection develops and disrupts the pulsation mechanism, giving rise to the red edge of the instability strip. A preliminary study of two of these stars, V553 Cen and RT TrA was conducted during a Discretionary Time program. Though this represented only a snapshot of two particular phases, we discovered a large variation in the Mg II doublet. The present proposal is to perform an extensive survey of the variation with pulsation phase, concentrating on the most significant parts of the light curve, viz., minimum, rising light, and maximum. The information should allow us to better understand the evolutionary state of these stars, and may serve to resolve the paradox of their existence.|Y
CCQNE|Resolved Companions of Cepheids|Nancy|Evans|Space Astrophysics Laboratory|A number of classical Cepheids have relatively close but resolved companions. We have recently determined the colors of the companions from ground-based CCD images. If we use the E(B-V) for the Cepheids, the intrinsic colors of 9 of the 13 companions are very blue, implying that they are young stars likely to be physically associated with the Cepheids rather than field stars. This is a proposal to study these companions using IUE for two reasons. First an early spectral type would confirm that they are hot stars indicating that they really are widely spaced binary companions. This would mean that they are a sample of the most widely spaced binary companions known. The question of the cutoff in the separation of binaries is an active area of research. Second if they actually are companions, the IUE observations can be used to determine the luminosities of the Cepheids. Since three of the four stars on the target list are long period Cepheids, luminosity determination is particularly valuable.|Y

CDDMS|A Study of Variable Ultraviolet Extinction in Hot Stars with Circumstellar Dust Shells|Michael L.|Sitko|Minnesota|I propose to observe 8 hot stars with circumstellar dust shells with IUE. All of the targets are variable and this variability is probably associated with changes in the dust extinction in the shell. I propose to monitor the changes in the UV flux distributions in these stars. The new data when combined with existing data will provide a data base extending over 3 1/2 years. Measured changes in the UV flux distributions will yield valuable information about the composition and size distribution of the circumstellar particles.|Y
CDESB|RV Tauri Star Circumstellar Dust|Scott R.|Baird|Clemson|We propose to use the extensive dust shells that arc known to surround RV Tauri pulsational variable stars to discriminate between possible origins of the strong ultraviolet absorption feature centered near 2200A. This feature his long been seen in the interstellar medium, but its source is still in dispute. By observing this feature in the circumstellar dust shells of both the carbon enhanced star AC Her (which has more carbon than oxygen in its atmosphere and should he surrounded by carbon-based dust grains) and in the dust shells of the stars U Mon and R Set (which have more oxygen than carbon and should he surrounded by normal silicates) we will be able to tell if the 2200 feature is caused by carbon-based grains, silicate grains, or both. If we are granted our time in two blocks so we can observe those variables at both primary and secondary maxima, we can accomplish our secondary objective, which is to see if the 2200 feature exhibits changes with phase. The polarization of the visible continua of these stars is known to change with phase: if we find the 2200 feature changes with phase, we will have strong evidence that the polarization is caused by the circumstellar dust and not, as Serkowski (1970) has suggested, by nonspherical oscillations of the star itself.|Y
CDFJH|Dust Extinction in HR 5999|James H.|Hecht|Aerospace Corporation|The variable shell star HR 5999 will be monitored by taking 16 spectra from 1200 - 3200 A. By spacing the observations over a period of one year we expect to be able to catch the star during at least one minimum. Since the variability is caused by the appearance of dust grains we will be able to derive an extinction curve without the need for a comparison star.  The interpretation of the data will use Mie calculations for the extinction of particles of possible circumstellar composition. Comparisons will be made with the results of other work on this star, on R Cr B stars, on stars with circumstellar shells, and on interstellar extinction.|Y
CDFMK|Ultraviolet Extinction in Symbiotic Stars|Minas|Kafatos|George Mason University|Estimates for extinction based on the 12175A feature in an assortment of heavily reddened objects appear to seriously underestimate absorption if compared to values of E(B-V) obtained from optical line diagnostics. This form of anomalous UV extinction appears to be present for a category of symbiotic stars that are enveloped in circumstellar dust. An IUE archival study is proposed here to investigate the ultraviolet extinction properties of symbiotic stars previously observed with IUE. Our objective is to investigate possible correlations between anomalously weak 2175A absorption in symbiotics believed strongly reddened in the optical, and which from infrared studies are known to be enveloped with dust. Because stellar parameters of luminosity and effective temperature of the hot companions in these systems can be determined from energy distribution of UV continuum emission, applying the correct extinction law is crucial in determining the nature of the hot companions in these systems. Theoretical models that have been proposed which involve tidal mass transfer to the secondary critically depend on the nature of the accreting object and the UV emission properties of the accretion disk that is formed during episodes of tidal mass exchange. Additionally, an absence of absorption at 2175A in systems known to be heavily reddened in the optical and infrared suggests that the extinction law which applies locally to circumstellar material differs significantly from the "normal" galactic law. As has been suggested for a number of other diverse astronomical objects, the chemical composition and physical structure of dust particles in circumstellar material is probably very different from material composition of grains that form the diffuse interstellar medium. The objectives of this archival proposal and method of data analysis follows.|Y
CDIPS|Archival Study of Disks in Cataclysmic Variables at Quiescence|Paula|Szkody|Washington|An archival study of all disk cataclysmic variables (category 54 and 63) at quiescence is planned in order to assess the slope of the continuum region in the 1200-3000 A region. Excluding the objects for which the necessary information exists in the literature, there are about 50 systems for which SWP and LWR/LWP low dispersion observations occur in the IUE databank. Due to the turnover in the slope of the theoretical flux distribution at low accretion rates (M), the UV provides a sensitive probe of the mass accretion rate in cataclysmic variables. Thus, this archival study combined with data already in the literature provides the slope for a large number of systems which allows the calibration of an M, orbital period relation in a consistent fashion for all disk systems and within given categories such as Z Cam, DQ Her types. In addition at short P (low M), the presence of a massive white dwarf is evident from the flux distribution, allowing a determination of the dependence of white dwarf mass on orbital period and within a given subtype.|Y
CDJTS|Depletions in Dense Diffuse Clouds|Theodore P.|Snow|Colorado - CASA|We propose a continuation of our ongoing program of study of depletions in diffuse clouds. We are now concentrating on clouds thought (on the basis of CN data) to have relatively high densities, because in the previous year we uncovered an apparent tendency of certain elements (such as Mn) to deplete preferentially in dense regions. If confirmed, this is very significant, because it may allow us to specify which elements are depleted during grain formation, and which are later depleted by accretion onto grains. We also plan to pursue an apparent relationship between enhanced depletion and UV extinction curve shape, which potentially may tell us which grains are responsible for the depletion that occurs in clouds. Data quality must be high for this study, and we plan to use multiple exposures made with the target stars at varying offsets in the large aperture, so that the fixed-pattern noise in the detectors will be reduced by coadding the exposures.|Y

CEITS|Extinction and Grain Properties in Circumstellar Shells|Theodore P.|Snow|Colorado - CASA|We propose to investigate the UV extinction from circumstellar shells of the extreme mass-loss cool stars, namely oxygen-rich M supergiants and carbon-rich C stars, which are important contributors to the interstellar medium (ISM). By using archival data and by taking low-resolution spectra of the hot-compamions seen in absorption through a variety of cool-star winds, we can classify the hot stars much better than before and derive new circumstellar selective-extinction curves for different spectral types and abundance types of the stars. Thus, from this survey of extinctions, we will be able to draw conclusions about the effects of environment (differing ionizing flux, shell temperature and density) upon the formation of and selective-extinction properties of both oxygen-grams and carbon-grains. Most significantly, we can apply this knowledge of the extinction properties of thew grain types to the analysis of the gram mixture in the general interstellar medium by identifying the fraction of the ISM extinction features that are produced by either oxygen-rich or carbon-rich grain populations. Finally, our observations will permit us to de-convolve the photometry of the composite systems, calculate the ratio of selective to visual extinction in the circumstellar shells, and to derive the distances to these luminous supergiants.|Y

CEKTS|Circumstellar Extinction in Red Giants and Supergiants|Theodore P.|Snow|Colorado - CASA|We have been studying the extinction properties of circumstellar grains in M supergiant envelopes by using IUE spectra of binary systems containing a hot companion. These studies have been fruitful, and we have shown that the circumstellar extinctions tend not to have 2175 A extinction and might exhibit a weak far ultraviolet extinction rise. Additionally, most systems seem devoid of dust while a few possess dust. One of the difficulties we have encountered in the study has come from separating the interstellar and circumstellar contributions to the extinction: we have been forced to estimate the foreground contribution from other interstellar parameters, some of which are themselves uncertain.  We are now proposing to eliminate this problem for some systems where binary orbital motion during the lifetime of IUE has altered the relative projected positions of the M supergiant and the hot star. Several systems were observed during the first couple of years of IUE observations and have not been observed since. The known orbital periods of this type of binary are typically about ten to twenty years, so new observations during the coming year should yield a circumstellar extinction while eliminating the interstellar extinction. The light path through the envelope of the red supergiant to the hot companion will most likely have changed enough for us to detect a varying circumstellar extinction independent of interstellar extinction. Thus, the observations will give more reliable extinction properties of cool star grains and permit a more confident interpretation of the intriguing results from previous work.|Y
CEQNE|Masses for Two Classical Cepheids|Nancy|Evans|Space Astrophysics Laboratory|Determination of an accurate mass for a classical Cepheid is a very important problem to which IUE high resolution spectra have made a major contribution. Observational Cepheid masses are needed both to confirm evolutionary tracks for these stars on which the extragalactic distance scale is heavily based and also to constrain the treatment of core convective overshoot in intermediate mass stars. The IUE velocity observations of this proposal will determine the mass for a long period Cepheid T Mon (by determining the scale factor or mass ratio between the orbital velocity curves of the Cepheid and the companion) and improve the mass of SU Cyg (particularly by improving the short period orbit of the companion which is itself a binary.) Because these observations are very time critical (particularly those of SU Cyg), it is unlikely that Hubble Space telescope will ever attempt this project.|Y
CERBM|First High Resolution Monitoring of a Type II Cepheid|Bruce M.|McCollum|CSC - Astronomy Programs|We propose to obtain high-resolution IUE spectra of BV 690, a recently reported Type Il Cepheid which is the first Type Il Cepheid bright enough for reasonably short IUE exposures to provide good S/N high resolution data. Specific goals include (1) To see whether there is Mg II emission in BV 690, as seen in some other Cepheids, (2) To see whether, or how, such Mg II emission vanes over a pulsation cycle, as is does in Type I Cepheids, (3) To determine whether the UV light curve shows an emission bump in the descending branch, (4) To see whether there are any emission lines in SWP wavelengths, and, if so, whether they are phase dependent, (5) To see how BV 690 fits into the chromospheric activity UV color index classification scheme of Eaton. This program will be an important probe of chromospheric activity and will allow us to compare the passage of shocks through the atmospheres of Type II Cepheids with similar phenomena in the better-studied Type I Cepheids. This will represent the final opportunity to add a high-dispersion data set for a Type Il Cepheid to the IUE archive, complimenting the extensive work on Classical Cepheids.|Y
CERNE|Pulsating Atmospheres: V473 Lyr|Nancy Remage|Evans|ISTS|IUE observations have provided major new insights into the outer atmospheres of pulsating and nonvariable supergiants. This proposal is to observe Mg II h and k lines and also H-alpha in the unique Cepheid V743 Lyr at full amplitude (37 km/sec) and at a vanishingly small amplitude (2 km/sec). This direct comparison between a pulsating atmosphere and a nearly constant one is an excellent test of a calculated atmosphere. It will also provide answers to such questions as: How closely do upper atmosphere diagnostics of a barely pulsating star match those of nonpulsating stars? Does the Mg II flux decrease as pulsation increases? How about H-alpha asymmetries and line width? Do random motions in the atmosphere increase when pulsation is decreased (as would be inferred from variable/nonvariable comparisons of H-alpha)? Modeling these observations using sophisticated codes will provide insight into the upper atmospheres of both pulsating and nonvariable stars.|Y
CGHAD|The Chromosphere and Wind of HD 6833|Andrea K.|Dupree|CFA|The metal deficient field giant star, HD 6833 is one of the brightest of its class at V - 6.76, thus allowing study of chromospheric structure and of wind parameters. We propose to make a deep, high dispersion exposure at long wavelengths to search for the presence of circumstellar absorption in ]Mg II to measure its velocity, if found, and to determine the profiles of the Mg II emission lines. In addition, we plan a long, low dispersion, short wavelength exposure to test our conjecture that the chromospheres of metal deficient stars are hotter than those of Pop I stars. A measurement of the O I flux will determine if HD 6833 is similar to the luminous hybrid stars (with high temperature emission coupled with massive winds) or is more like cool giant stars that lack hot material.|Y
CGHHB|Winds and Shells Around Low-Mass Supergiants|Howard E.|Bond|STScI|A class of metal-deficient F-type supergiants has recently been identified. They appear to be low-mass stars evolving rapidly off the asymptotic giant branch toward the regime of the central stars of planetary nebulae. All members of this class appear to be low-amplitude semiregular variables.  We will obtain high-dispersion long-wavelength IUE spectra of three relatively bright members of this class, in order to study the profiles of the Mg II doublet at 2800.  The observations should allow us to detect the presence of mass outflow from the stellar atmospheres, and to search for circumstellar material (an un-ionized "planetary nebula") that could be the remnant of a mass-ejection episode that occurred when the star was on the asymptotic giant branch.  The observations will provide information not only on the transitory stage of evolution through which these stars are passing, but on the general question of the origin of planetary nebulae.|Y
CGHTS|Chromospheric Activity and Spindown in the Hertzsprung Gap|Theodore|Simon|Hawaii|In low dispersion IUE spectra of F, G, and K giants, chromospheric and transition region (TR) emission lines are strong in the F stars, reach a peak in the early 6 giants, and then fall to much lower brightness levels in the late G and K giants. This trend is consistent with an evolutionary decay of dynamo action as rapidly-rotating high mass stars cross the Hertzsprung gap, develop hydrogen convection zones, and then spin down to slow rotation rates through the braking torque of their magneticallycoupled winds. It is important to understand the nature of this process by which the loss of angular momentum results in the weakening of surface magnetic fields and chromospheric-coronal heating.  We propose to obtain a double-shift (~15 hour) high dispersion SWP spectrum of HR 9024, a G1 III star having bright chromospheric and TR emission lines in low dispersion spectra. At high dispersion we will be able to resolve the profiles of individual emission lines, from which we will derive temperature. density, and velocity field models for the chromosphere and TR. We will investigate the energy balance of this model in order to compare with the theories of acoustic and magnetic wave heating. With precautions to ensure the fidelity of the wavelength scale, we will look for evidence of differential velocity shifts between TR and chromospheric lines. which may arise. from global atmospheric circulation patterns or propagating waves. HR 9024 will be compared with Beta Dra and 31 Com to study the evolution of dynamo activity and atmospheric structure in the Hertzsprung gap.|Y
CGIEB|MG II Line Profiles in W VIR|Erika|Bohm-Vitense|Washington|On low resolution spectra the Mg II emission lines at 2800 A of W Vir nearly always show the same central intensities, regardless of the pulsational cycle. This suggests that the Mg II emission lines do not originate in the stellar photosphere or chromosphere but rather in detached circumstellar material possibly indicating mass loss for this prototype population no. II Cepheid. During minimum light, however, the emission lines at 2800 A appears much weakened, an additional emission line appears at 2828 A. We would like to take high resolution IUE spectra with the long wavelength camera in order to study the Mg II line profiles and to see whether they share the photospheric velocities or at least the pulsational velocity cycle or whether they originate in detached circumstellar material. If so this would be a definite sign of mass loss by at least one population II Cepheid. If all population II Cepheids turn out to lose mass during their pulsationally unstable phases of stellar evolution this may possibly be a way to transform red giants into horizontal branch stars.|Y
CGIHB|Winds and Shells Around Low-Mass Supergiants|Howard E.|Bond|STScI|A class of F-type supergiants lying at high galactic latitudes (the 89 Herculis or UU Herculis stars) has been known for some years. More recent evidence suggests that these objects are not young Population I objects, but instead are much older low-mass stars evolving off the tip of the asymptotic giant branch toward the regime of central stars of planetary nebulae. It is possible that these stars are already surrounded by unionized planetary nebulae, if they have experienced an extreme mass-ejection episode (or "superwind") when they were at the tip of the asymptotic giant branch.  We propose to obtain high-dispersion long-wavelength IUE spectra of several 89 Hertype stars, in order to study the profiles of the Mg II doublet at 2800. The observations should allow us to detect the presence of mass outflow from the stellar atmospheres, and to search for circumstellar material. Discovery of such material would provide support for the scenario for planetary-nebula formation outlined above.  This program is a continuation of one begun during the eighth year of IUE observing. During the past year, we obtained one high-dispersion long-wavelength spectrum of HR 4912, a bright 89 Her-type object. A preliminary analysis does indicate evidence for circumstellar absorption. Moreover, the chromospheric Mg II emission shows an unusual inverse P Cygni profile. This observation shows that our program is likely to provide important new information not only about mass loss from, but also about chromospheric conditions in, the atmospheres of these rare, low-mass supergiants.|Y
CGJEB|Masses for Four Cepheids|Erika|Bohm-Vitense|Washington|Velocities from IUE high dispersion spectra have provided mass ratios between a Cepheid and a blue companion for the systems SU Cyg, S Mus, and V636 Sco. The proposed IUE high dispersion observations will produce a mass ratio for a new system, U Aql. with a percentage error as low as 14%. depending on the orbital velocity amplitude of the companion. They will also provide a second optimal spectrum for both S Mus and V636 Sco which will confirm the previous results at the second velocity extremum, reduce the uncertainty in the mass ratio by sqrt 2 to 14%. and also provide an error estimate from comparison with the previous spectrum. For AW Per a spectrum will provide a preliminary mass function. confirmation that it is not a triple system, and information about the rotational velocity for a system which can be resolved by Hubble Space Telescope.  These results, together with the SU Cyg results, are the only mass determinations for Cepheids to decide between the discordant evolutionary and pulsational masses.|Y

CIPJG|High Velocity Circumstellar Material From Evolved Massive Stars|James C.|Green|Colorado - CASA|Undeniable evidence now exists that massive stellar evolution can end as a supernova from a blue supergiant star. The ratio of the number of blue supergiant stars who have gone through a red giant phase to the number of blue supergiant stars first leaving the main sequence is thus finite, and may be a scientifically significant ratio. If a significant number of the blue-red-blue evolved supergiants exist, they should be detectable via the interaction of the 2nd phase of their fast blue supergiant wind with the slower, dense red supergiant wind, such as the one currently detected in SN 1987A. We know of two such evolved, massive stars, whose IUE spectra show very strong evidence that they may have shed a large amount of mass in a slower, dense wind that their current fast winds are now impacting upon. We are asking for additional IUE spectra to increase signal-to-noise toward these two sightlines with weak, 100 km/s, blue-shifted absorption features. With higher signal-to-noise, the chemical and physical nature of the features can be obtained. We wish to compare their values with those obtained from the bright rings detected around SN 1987A to possibly identify a similar origin.|Y

CJQMM|IUE Observations of the Impact of Comet Shoemaker-Levy with Jupiter|Melissa|McGrath|STScI|The impact of Comet Shoemaker-Levy with Jupiter in late July 1994 has the potential to be an event of unprecedented proportions, producing unusual effects in the Jovian atmosphere and throughout the Jovian magnetosphere. IUE is well poised to provide extremely valuable observations of any pronounced changes in the atmosphere and magnetosphere during the impact event because of the detailed understanding afforded by the hundreds of observations of the Jovian system throughout the past 16 years, which will provide a solid basis for assessing any changes. We request a straightforward, integrated observing strategy for studying a broad range of atmospheric and magnetospheric phenomena, including the planetary albedo, the Ly-alpha bulge, the auroral emissions, and the Io plasma torus, which may show unusual changes. Our team provides wide expertise in all aspects required for a comprehensive observing campaign, including extensive observational, data reduction and analysis experience with IUE, as well as timely publication of our results.|Y
CJQTL|Auroral Consequences of Comet Shoemaker-Levy IX's Perturbation of the Jovian Magnetosphere|Timothy|Livengood|NASA/GSFC|We will investigate perturbation of Jovian auroral activity by the sudden injection of matter into the magnetosphere, to obtain insights into processes connecting the aurora and the primary source of magnetospheric matter, the satellite Io. We will monitor collisionally-excited H2 emissions to determine the propagation time for perturbations of the plasmasphere to appear in the aurora. Perturbations are expected to derive primarily from the ejection of a small fraction of the Jovian atmosphere into the inner magnetosphere as a result of impacts by fragments of comet P/Shoemaker-Levy IX; outgassing and dust from the in-bound comet will also contribute. The observations will be assessed in comparison with the large database of identically-acquired IUE auroral observations. Simultaneous ground-based observations in the mid- and near-IR are proposed at the European Southern Observatory. Combined with IUE observations, the first global daily measurements of Jovian auroral processes from ~1 mbar to ~1 nbar will be achieved. The proposed observations will be distributed over five weeks in order to investigate the propagation of the impulsive forcing. These observations will provide an unprecedented intensive investigation of short time-scale variability in the Jovian aurora.|Y
CJQWH|Observation of the Shoemaker-Levy/Jupiter Collision|Walter|Harris|University of Michigan|In July of 1994 an extraordinary event will take place when the remnants of comet/asteroid ShoemakerLevy-9 collide with Jupiter. This impact represents an important opportunity to observe the effects of a large impact on the atmosphere and magnetosphere of a planet. Shoemaker-Levy-9 will enter the Jovian magnetosphere near the beginning of the month, and strike the planet over several days around the 21st. Anticipated consequences of this collision include the creation of high temperature atmospheric shocks in the atmosphere, upwelling of material from the deep atmosphere, changes in the composition and thermal profile of the upper atmosphere, and a host of electrodynamic effects associated with the interaction of cometary dust with the Jovian magnetosphere. We propose to observe these phenomenon though spectroscopic observations of the Jovian upper atmosphere with the IUE. Emphasis will be placed on both processes in the impact regions as well as on a search for variability in previously observed phenomena such as the aurora, equatorial Ly-alpha bulge, and the dayglow spectrum of mid latitudes. The unique capabilities of the IUE provide an opportunity to observe changes in specific, well studied phenomena continuously over long periods and facilitate the detection of collision related effects undetectable outside the far ultraviolet spectral range.|Y

CLNSC|UV Spectra of H2 Emitting Shocks|Salvador|Curiel|Harvard CFA - SAO|Graham et al. (1990) have observed infrared H2 emission lines in the NE section of the Cygnus Loop associated with the 100-200 km/s shocks seen optically. Intensity ratios of the infrared lines show that the emission cannot be fluorescence, and Graham et al. suggest that it arises in a magnetic precursor which dissipates a significant fraction of the shock energy. We have developed models for such precursors in HH objects, and we propose IUE observations of four Cygnus Loop filaments bright in H2 lines and optical emission lines. The UV spectra will fix parameters of the precursor models and test some aspects of the models.|Y
CLNWB|Scattering and Grain Destruction in the Cygnus Loop|William P.|Blair|Johns Hopkins University|Most existing IUE observations of the Cygnus Loop are of crisp filaments believed to be sheets of gas seen in an "edge-on" geometry. In this situation, many of the UV permitted emission lines such as O II 1335, C IV 1550, and Mg II 2800 should be greatly reduced by resonance scattering. This effect has made it nearly impossible to study the effects of dust grain destruction in any meaningful way, because one would like to use many of this same lines to determine the elemental abundances of refractory elements in the gas. In this proposal we will observe two new positions in the Cygnus Loop where the geometry of the filaments is known and where the effects of resonance scattering can be determined and removed. We will then use shock models to investigate abundances and grain destruction in the observed shock.|Y
CLOJR|IUE Observations of HUT and ROSAT Targets in the Cygnus Loop|John C.|Raymond|Harvard CFA - SAO|The interaction of a supernova remnant blastwave with dense clouds dictates the appearance and governs the evolution of the SNR, and the Cygnus Loop is an ideal target for studies of this interaction. The Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope observed a UV bright knot at the eastern edge of the Cygnus Loop, and we have been awarded ROSAT time to observe a field which contains this knot and several other features which exemplify different phases of the interaction of a blastwave with a small cloud and with a single large cloud. We wish to observe five positions with IUE to determine the nature of the shock propagating into the dense cloud material.|Y
CLPWB|Cloud Crushing in the Southeast Cygnus Loop|William P.|Blair|Johns Hopkins University|A region of the southeastern Cygnus Loop has recently been identified as representing a particularly good example of an interstellar cloud being overrun by a shock wave. The optical morphology of the cloud looks remarkably like recent hydrodynamic simulations of a cloud being overrun by a fast shock wave. Except for the cloud region itself, the line of sight to this region appears uncontaminated by foreground or background emission sources. We have access to a large body of supporting data at optical and X-ray wavelengths that permit us to select positions for IUE observation. We will look at several locations in the cloud to study the shock/cloud interaction in unprecedented detail. We will also study a nearby nonradiative shock wave to determine whether it is a related "reverse shock" caused by this shock/cloud interaction. Optical echelle data for this filament indicate bulk motions of at least 250 km/s, considerably faster than similar shock waves found elsewhere in the Cygnus Loop.|Y
CLQJR|IUE Observations of a Marginally Radiative Shock Wave|John|Raymond|CFA - SAO|Non-radiative shocks, seen as faint Balmer line filaments at the peripheries of several supernova remnants, provide the only observational tests for theoretical models of collisionless shock waves in the ISM. The most accessible to study is a filament in the northeast Cygnus Loop which we have observed from the ground, with IUE, and with the Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope. Analyses of the IUE spectrum (20" of the filament) and the HUT spectrum (119" along the filament) are contradictory. We propose to obtain IUE spectra at other positions along the filament to assess the extent of brightness changes. The ultimate goal is to understand the nature of electron-ion equilibration in collisionless shocks and the shock wave deceleration due to radiative cooling and density gradients.|Y
CLRLD|Searching for the High Velocity Cloud Toward HD 135484|Laura|Danly|STScI|Optical absorption line studies of the star HD 135485 have revealed several distinct absorption components at lambda 3933 A (Ca II). These components, if indeed due to interstellar Ca II absorption, suggest the presence of negative high velocity (< -100 km/s) clouds (HVC) along this line of sight. The present data are not sufficient to distinguish between an interstellar and a circumstellar origin for the observed detections. The objective of this project is to determine conclusively the presence or absence of HVC towards the star HD 135485.|Y

CMBBS|Ultraviolet Studies of Hot Stars with Circumstellar Dust|Blair D.|Savage|Wisconsin|IUE observing time is requested to observe in low resolution a representative group of hot stars surrounded by circumstellar dust. The presence of dust is inferred from the large infrared excesses associated with the program stars. Measurements of the continuous ultraviolet energy distributions of these objects will permit us to investigate the modifications of the emergent flux produced by the dust. Theoretical modeling of the conversion of ultraviolet and visible radiation into infrared radiation in circumstellar dust shells will set important new constraints on the physical nature of circumstellar dust and circumstellar shells. An attempt will be made to associate ultraviolet absorbing and infrared emitting properties of circumstellar dust. Since some of the program stars are variable in the infrared, an attempt will be made to secure infrared observations almost simultaneously with the ultraviolet.|Y
CMBRS|A Study of Chromospheres and Circumstellar Envelopes in G,K, and M Supergiants by Obtaining and Analyzing IUE Profiles|Robert E.|Stencel|NASA/GSFC|We propose to derive physical models of chromospheres and circumstellar envelopes of cool supergiants for spectral types G0 through mid-M and covering luminosity classes II through Ia-0. To derive these models we request IUE time to observe the target stars at high dispersion with the LWR camera. The lines of interest are MgII 2798, 2803, MgI 2852, and a number of Fe I and Fe II lines at 2400-3200 A, especially the Fe II lines near 2500 A.  We expect these lines to have chromospheric emission components and blue-shifted circumstellar absorption components. These complex line profiles will be modelled using a spherical geometry partial redistribution computer code which solves the transfer equation in the comoving frame of the absorbing atoms. We are especially interested in the dynamics of the mass loss processes in these stars and the extent to which the outer atmospheres are inhomogeneous.|Y
CMGDH|UV Observations of Vega System Material|Doyal A.|Harper|Chicago|We propose to use IUE to search for an ultraviolet marker for the extended material which causes the intense infrared emission found by IRAS around the nearby star Vega (alpha Lyr). These observations will test for fluorescence from gas phase molecules and atoms found in cometary halos, H2, 0II, 00, OI and CI, as well as reflection from particulate material. Once an UV marker is established, it can be used to probe the geometry and physical condition of the emitting material. This source is expected to be very faint in the UV, so anticipated exposure times are long.|Y

CMIES|Expanding Circumbinary Gas Around V471 Tauri|Edward M.|Sion|Villanova|We propose to observe the white dwarf component in the Hyades eclipsing, spectroscopic binary V471 Tauri (K2 V + DA2) at high resolution with the IUE telescope. Our scientific objectives are (1) to confirm the reality of the shortward-shifted absorption features at -260 km/s and -S90 km/s with a full IUE echelle exposure; (2) to detect any other circumbinary features with the same ( about 7 hr.) exposure; (3) to obtain and co-add four echelle images at shorter exposure time near binary phase 0.65 and 0.1 where critical evidence of any accretion flow from the K dwarf to the white dwarf, circumstellar material, weak metal and/or helium features due to the white dwarf or any other features, may be detected. If the shortwardshifted high velocity absorption features are real, they may be evidence of a discrete (nova-like?) mass ejection and/or continuous stellar wind outflow from the K dwarf.|Y
CMIFB|Beta Pictoris and Other Candidate Proto-Planetary Systems Near the Sun|Frederick C.|Bruhweiler|Catholic University|We will expand upon our earlier preliminary IUE investigation (Kondo and Bruhweiler 1985) of the circumstellar disk surrounding the IRAS candidate proto-planetary system, Beta Pictoris. We will also search for other similar systems near the Sun, and investigate the link between objects like Beta Pictoris and the early-type shell stars. Our published results, and our very recent observations reveal variable gaseous absorption, possibly indicative of gaseous condensations in an orbiting disk around this star. If the variations reflect orbital motion, further UV observations of this system could constrain the physical sizes of these condensations and their orbital distances. Results from IRAS imply that about 1/3 of all A stars near the Sun have infrared excesses possibly signalling the presence of extended disks like that seen around Beta Pictoris. A sample of 29 bright A stars within 25 pc with large v-sin(i) will be probed utilizing both archival and newly acquired high dispersion LWP images. Sharp absorption arising from fine-structure transitions of the ground configuration and metastable transitions of Fe II will provide, as they have for Beta Pictoris, unambiguous indicators of circumstellar gaseous absorption. This study should provide important information on the physical conditions in candidate proto-planetary systems and clues to the formation of our own solar system.|Y

To continue monitoring Beta Pictoris. This will be used to search for additional episodes of high velocity mass infall, like that already observed. In addition, we will determine if the equivalent width variations in the sharp component can be interpreted as orbiting gaseous clumps moving in and out of the line-of-sight. If this view is correct, it should be feasible to determine the distances, sizes, and physical conditions in these clumps.  2.) To continue monitoring the IRAS protoplanetary system candidate, Sigma Her, and the A-shell star, HD 148283, a spectral analogue to Beta Pic. This will be used to explore the extent of the similarities in spectral behavior between these objects and Beta Pictoris.  3.) To complete our search in the A-stars within 25 pc with vsin(i) > 100 km/s for evidence of circumstellar gas. Comparison of IUE and IRAS results for stars within this volume could yield important data on the frequency of A stars with circumstellar matter.  This study is expected to have important implications on theoretical models for the evolution of protoplanetary disks and to yield clues to the formation of our own solar system.|Y
CMKCG|Protoplanetary Disk and Circummstellar Shells in a Stars|Carol A.|Grady|CSC IUE|Abstract unavailable|N
CMKRS|Mapping Circumstellar Shells of Red Supergiant Stars|Robert E.|Stencel|Colorado - CASA|We propose to obtain off source observations of a variety of sources which are currently undergoing substantial mass loss or have in their recent history shown such evidence. Detection of signal in a majority species like Mg+ by means of emission near 2800A (among cool stars) will be crucial in establishing the existence, density and ionization state of material at large distances from the stars under consideration. Recent observational experience with the red supergiant, alpha Ori has shown that it is possible to obtain, at distances of 10 to 30+ arc sec from the star, circumstellar signal in excess of the background produced by scattered light in the telescope optics. This success implies the utility of this technique for a number of related, bright sources.|Y
CNJSS|Ultraviolet Observations of Three Bright Classical Novae|Sumner G.|Starrfield|Arizona State University|We propose to continue our observations of the three novae which are currently in outburst and bright enough to study with the IUE. We have obtained data on Nova Vul 1984 #2 since December 1984 and will have obtained data on Nova And 1986 and Nova Cen 1986 since December 1986. Ultraviolet spectroscopy of novae provides unique data that has allowed us to determine the abundances of the intermediate mass elements for previous novae and will allow the same analyses for these novae. Nova Vul 1984 #2 is a slow nova which is currently (December 1986) about m(v) ~10.8 and continues to be observable with IUE. Nova Cen and Nova and are currently about m(v) ~5 and m(v) ~6, respectively, and we have requested that they be declared Targets-of-Opportunity during the 9th year. Ultraviolet spectroscopy appropriately spaced in time (about 1 observation every-three months for a slow nova and more often for a fast nova) throughout their decline will provide measurements both of the shift of their luminosity into the ultraviolet and also the emission line strengths for a large number of elements. If we can observe these novae for a long enough time, we will be able to determine how such novae end their outburst. When combined with ground-based optical and infrared observations (which are being obtained as part of this project), the data will be used to model the outburst and thereby determine important physical characteristics of the nova such as the energy budget, chemical abundances of the critical CNONeMg elements, mass ejection rates, line formation mechanisms, and dust condensation processes.|Y
CNKSS|Ultraviolet Observations of Nova Vul 1984 ,2 and Nova Vul 1987|Sumner G.|Starrfield|Arizona|We propose to continue our observations of the two novae that are currently in outburst and bright enough to study with the IUE. We have obtained data on Nova Vul 1984 #2 since December 1984 and Nova Vul 1987 since November 1987. Nova Vul 1994 #2 is a slow nova which is currently (November 1987) about V = J2.4 (AAVSO) and continues to be observable with TUE. Nova Vul 1987 (currently V = 7.4: FES) was discovered in outburst just as this proposal was being finished and it is still too early to report any details. Ultraviolet spectroscopy appropriately spaced in time (I SWP and LWP image every three months) throughout this year will show how the emission line strengths vary with time for a large number of elements. Ultraviolet spectroscopy of these novae will provide unique data that will allow us to determine the abundances of the intermediate mass elements as we have done for previous novae. Nova Vul 1984 #2 is a nova whose ejecta are overabundant in oxygen, neon, and magnesium thus placing it in the class of objects whose outburst occurs on an ONeMg white dwarf as opposed to those outbursts that occur on a CO white dwarf, However, it is a slow nova in contrast to the predictions that all such outbursts should evolve very rapidly. If we can continue to observe these novae continuously through their outbursts, we will be able to determine how they return to quiescence. When combined with ground based optical and infrared observations (which are being currently being obtained for both novae as part of this project), the data will be used to model the outburst and thereby determine important physical characteristics of the nova such as the energy budget, chemical abundances of the critical CNONeMg elements, and mass ejection.|Y
CNMSS|Late Stages in the Outburst of Classical Novae|Sumner G.|Starrfield|Arizona|We propose to continue observations of three novae in outburst that are bright enough to study with the IUE Satellite. Two of these are also accepted targets for the ROSAT Satellite and we request contemporaneous observations. We are also requesting observing time to obtain SWP spectra of 8 additional targets in order to obtain UV data on three important problems: 1) the turn-off time scale and return to quiescence of the nova; 2) the long term evolution of the nova between outbursts; and 3) the ultraviolet spectra of magnetic novae.  We have obtained UV, optical, and IR data on Nova PW Vul 1984 #1 since August 1984 and UV and optical data on LMC Nova 1988 #2 since October 1988. The European Nova team has been observing GQ Mus since March 1983. No novae have been studied in the UV for as long as PW Vul and GQ Mus and they are providing unique data on the turn-off time scale. LMC Nova 1988 #2 was observed by means of our Target of Opportunity proposal in the 11th and 12th Episodes and was only the second extragalactic nova to be studied in the UV. The outburst properties of LMC #2 differ from LMC #1 and continuing observations are proposed.  New data will provide information on the mass and luminosity of the hot remnant, the time-scale for reestablishment of the accretion disk, and whether or not there are UV signatures of the magnetic nova phenomenon. The IUE study will be combined with contemporaneous ground based optical, IR, and radio observations (which are currently being obtained as part of this project but not funded by IUE) and with both KAO and ROSAT approved projects.|Y
COETA|Ultraviolet Observations of S Stars|Thomas B.|Ake|CSC|We propose to observe early S-type stars and compare them with model atmospheres and previous IUE observations of M giants and carbon stars to study upper atmospheric changes with variations in CNO composition. The near equivalence of carbon and oxygen in these stars alters the abundances of TiO, CO and CN which will affect the flux at ultraviolet wavelengths through changes in the upper photospheric temperature structure. Observations of chromospheric activity and the detection of transition region lines will indicate the importance of mechanical heating and permit detection of energetic phenomena that might produce abundance anomalies by spallation. The overabundance of lithium in certain members of the class suggest they have undergone recent mixing events that may be manifested in enhanced mass flow or close-lying circumstellar shells, both evident in the Mg II lines, compared to normal lithium abundance objects. If the current theory of Li production is correct, the Li-rich stars should also be overabundant in Be, and a search will be made for an increased absorption dip at 2350 A where the Be I resonance line occurs.|Y
COHNO|Masses and Nebular Velocity Structure of Symbiotic Stars|Nancy A.|Oliversen|CSC|High dispersion archival IUE spectra will be analyzed to find radial velocity variations in selected symbiotic stars. Such variations are expected due to the high probability that the stars are close binaries. The data will be used to estimate the mass ratios and velocity structure of several selected symbiotic stars. This data should provide crucial information on the masses of both components and of the hot component, in particular. Attempts at fitting the ultraviolet and visual spectra with a composite of a giant component, a hot component and a nebular emission source have been unsuccessful in several instances. This has been generally a result of a weak continuum emission and/or nebular emission which obscures the underlying hot component. A determination of a mass ratio would solve the uncertainty. The data will also be used to investigate the velocity and ionization structure in the outflowing nebular wind. From the relative phasing of the emission features the source of various emission lines will be investigated.  Orbital velocity variations have been detected in the optical spectra of only two other symbiotic stars, AG Pegasi and EG Andromedae. The velocity amplitudes are expected to range from about 20 to 50 km/sec. To detect these variations, it is crucial to have as accurate an absolute velocity calibration as possible (preferably +/-5 km/s). Several methods are available to obtain the best possible velocity calibration, including the reprocessing of about 70 archival images using time and camera temperature corrections to the wavelength calibration.  Since the orbital periods of these objects are from one to 3 years, at least a three year period is necessary to such a study. The IUE data archives contain high dispersion symbiotic star spectra which were obtained over a 7 year time period. Optical data is often not useful for such a study because the red giant absorption features are veiled by an overlying continuum emission and the Balmer emission lines are subject to self-absorption and transient mass motions within the systems. To our knowledge there are no optical data available or current observational program which could address the question of the masses of the binary components.|Y
COOKC|A Search for CO Molecular Absorption in Far-UV Spectra of Cool Stars|Kenneth G.|Carpenter|NASA/GSFC|We propose a far-UV survey of cool giant and supergiant stars to search for evidence of circumstellar absorption by the CO molecule. This survey is motivated by the discovery of a far-UV continuum and superposed circumstellar CO absorption in a spectrum of alpha Ori (M2 lab) obtained with HST and the subsequent demonstration that IUE is capable of detecting these bands. These bands are an excellent probe of the circumstellar regions of such stars, and provide diagnostics of layers not well sampled by other techniques. Where possible, very rough estimates of the conditions in the regions represented by the CO absorption will be obtained on the basis of these IUE data. The results of this survey will then be used to select targets/individual bands for observation at higher resolution with the GHRS/HST to allow detailed comparison with models and more precise determinations of temperatures and column densities in the circumstellar environment of these stars.|Y
COOMA|IUE Observations of Comets and Related Bodies|Michael F.|A'Hearn|U Maryland|We propose to observe comets P/Schaumasse, P/Shoemaker-Levy 6, and P/Grigg-Skjellerup. P/Schaumasse is the target for a pending HST proposal and we propose simultaneous IUE observations to determine temporal and spatial variability while HST is used for high sensitivity. P/Shoemaker-Levy 6 is potentially a bright comet and is treated as a Target of Opportunity. P/Grigg-Skjellerup, will be observed in conjunction with the encounter of the Giotto spacecraft with this comet We also propose to observe some asteroids which may exhibit cometary emission features. Our discovery of an OH emission band on one limb of Ceres but not the other immediately demands a mapping for spatial and temporal variability. 2201 Oljato was previously reported to exhibit optical emission characteristic of comets and we propose to search for OH emission at its current apparition.|Y
COOPF|Observations of Comets with the IUE|Paul D.|Feldman|Johns Hopkins University|The IUE spectrographs will be used to obtain ultraviolet spectra of a recently discovered -"new" comet, Shoemaker-Levy (1991ao, and a periodic comet, P/Schaumasse, as well as of any other suitable comet that may appear, as a target-of-opportunity, in the year beginning 1 June 1992 The goal of the program is to exploit the unique capabilities of IUE to examine both the long-term and short-term temporal behavior of the principal species of the gaseous coma and thereby understand the processes giving rise to the observed composition of the coma and ultimately the composition of the cometary ice itself. It is also proposed to obtain simultaneous observations with IUE and the Hubble Space Telescope of the two listed comets, in order to provide a framework for interpreting future HST observations of comets in terms of the large existing IUE cometary database.|Y
COPKC|CO Molecular Absorption in Far-UV Spectra of Cool Stars|Kenneth G.|Carpenter|NASA/GSFC|We propose a far-UV survey of cool giant and supergiant stars to search for evidence of circumstellar absorption by the CO molecule.

These bands are an excellent probe of the circumstellar regions of such stars, and provide diagnostics of layers not well sampled by other techniques. Where possible, very rough estimates of the conditions in the regions represented by the CO absorption will be obtained on the basis of these IUE data.

COPMA|IUE Observations of Comets and Related Bodies|Michael F.|A'Hearn|U Maryland|We propose to observe comet P/Encke to (1) search for long-term evolution in the behavior due to repeated perihelion passages, (2) relate the asymmetry about perihelion in the light curve to that in the molecular abundances and the atomic abundances, and (3) improve the signal-to-noise ratio on our present determination of the Greenstein effect in this comet which implies large ejection velocities in the northern hemisphere vent.  We also propose to observe (3200) Phaethon, the purported parent body of the Geminid meteor stream, to search more sensitively for outgassing than we have been able to do for any other object except Icarus. If this is truly the parent body of the meteor stream cometary outgassing might be expected.|Y

It is also proposed to obtain simultaneous observations with IUE and the Hubble Space Telescope of comet P/Encke, in order to provide a framework for interpreting future HST observations of comets in terms of the large existing IUE cometary database.|Y
CORCU|The Continuum Source in Blazars|C. Megan|Urry|STScI|The strong and variable gamma-ray emission from blazars requires relativistic beaming, but the physical origin of the radio-gamma-ray continuum remains a fundamental unknown in extragalactic astronomy. We propose a year-long IUE campaign to observe the unique blazar 3C279 for correlation with studies at other wavelengths. IUE intensities sampled bi-monthly will be correlated with long-time-scale radio flares; intensive IUE monitoring during December 1994 will be sensitive to faster variations and will be correlated with the rapidly variable gamma-ray flux. Observed variations in L(gamma)/L(UV) and Ly-alpha will determine the origin of the seed UV photons that are Compton-scattered to gamma-ray energies. To optimize use of IUE, we will also observe 3C273 in conjunction with an intensive Rosat campaign.  Multiwavelength monitoring offers a unique opportunity to test the relativistic jet paradigm. The proposed IUE observations are designed for time scales from a few hours to one year. GRO observations of 3C279 have been proposed, simultaneous ASCA monitoring of 3C279 and 3C273 is being proposed, and we will also cover optical, infrared, millimeter and radio wavelengths. Together with ongoing VLBI observations, these data allow determination of bulk velocity, viewing angle, and physical parameters of the jet.|Y
CORMA|IUE Observations of Targets of Opportunity (Comets and Related Bodies)|Michael F.|A'Hearn|U Maryland|We request several shifts to be set aside for possible cometary targets of opportunity. Such observations could be valuable to (1) expand the database with which we are trying to understand variations in chemical abundances, (2) take advantage of particularly favorable geometric circumstances, such as very close approaches to Earth, to search for parent molecules and to map the spatial distribution of various species in the coma, and (3) study physical processes in the coma or fine structure in the spectrum, should a suitably bright target appear. A fairly bright (~mag 8) comet might warrant only a shift or two to study chemical abundances. For a bright (~mag 6) comet. it would be useful to conduct monitoring over a week or so to study temporal variations in activity and relative abundances. Should a very bright (< mag 4) comet appear, we would request many shifts to do detailed studies (in high dispersion) of velocity profiles within the coma as well as of particular emission mechanisms, along with intensive low-dispersion monitoring of a periodic variations. Further, the discovery of an object suggesting a transition between cometary and asteroidal characteristics would be a rare opportunity to try to positively identify a member of this putative class of objects.|Y
CORNE|"Little h" and Chi Per: Rotation and Be Stars|Nancy Remage|Evans|ISTS|The open clusters h and chi Per contain a large number of rapidly rotating stars, and also many Be stars as well as normal B stars. IUE high resolution spectra have contributed greatly to our understanding of the details of the Be process, but IUE low resolution spectra have not yet been used to investigate how Be stars fit into the context of stellar evolution. This proposal takes the classic approach of using cluster stars to study stellar evolution. IUE observations, however, avoid the the very large bolometric corrections needed in ground-based studies which may obscure the relation between different types of stars. We will obtain SWP low resolution spectra to create an HR diagram from ultraviolet spectral types (temperatures) and an ultraviolet magnitude (much closer to a bolometric magnitude than is possible from the ground). These measurements of the energy distribution close to its peak will be used to investigate the effects of rotation on evolutionary tracks and also whether Be stars are confined to a particular phase of evolution, as has been suggested by a recent ground-based study.|Y

CPIJH|Rapid Variations in the Far-Ultraviolet Spectrum of the Cool Ap Star 21 Com|J. P.|Halpern|Columbia Astrophysics Labratory|Previous IUE observations of the cool Ap star 21 Com (A3SrCr) show strong flux variations in the far-ultraviolet (0.1 mag at 1500 A) with a (rotational) period close to one day. In addition, the archival spectra of 21 Com reveal an instance of large and rapid variation at wavelengths shorter than 1700 A when the ultraviolet flux is maximum. The spectra display deep, broad absorption lines which come and go in 80 minutes or less. More IUE data are needed to determine the timescale of the variations, and the rotational phases during which they occur. We will take high resolution SWP spectra separated by 30 minutes, covering all phases of the rotation period. We can then determine whether the variations occur at other phases, and whether they are periodic, as might be expected if they are due to stellar pulsations.|Y

CSBKN|UV Spectroscopy of Cool Stars in Luminosity Classes I-V|K. R.|Nicolas|Naval Research Laboratory|We propose to observe bright late type stars (G2-K5) in luminosity classes I-V at both low (3 x 10^2) and high (10^4) spectral resolution in the wavelength range 1170-1920 A.   We will test the predictions, implied both by observations (Wilson and Bappu 1957) and by theoretical calculations (de Loore 1970), that the mechanical energy flux, F(m), generated in the convective zone beneath the photosphere increases as stars less than about 1.3 M(sun) evolve toward the giant and supergiant region of the H-R diagram. This flux propagates outward and heats a tenuous atmosphere above the photosphere, forming a chromosphere-corona. Since F(m) for giants and supergiants is larger than values predicted for late main sequence stars, the high temperature envelope may also be more extensive than that observed for the sun. The transition zone pressure should be less, and the mass outflow larger, than solar values.  These predictions can be tested by the interpretation of resonance, subordinate, and intersystem emission line intensities observed in the EUV stellar spectra. These lines might be emitted from a chromosphere-corona transition region between 2 x 10^4 and 2 x 10^5 K. We will derive the electron pressure, independently of the value of the surface gravity, from observed line intensity ratios that are functions of electron pressure.|Y
CSBLD|Observations of MG II 2800 A in Cool Stars|Lowell R.|Doherty|Wisconsin|The resonance lines of Mg II near 2800 A are sensitive indicators of chromospheric strength in cool stars. High resolution profiles of these lines and other features in the near ultraviolet spectrum of selected main sequence F and G stars will be obtained with IUE in Round One. The aim of this program is to investigate chromospheric structure in stars whose overall structure is very different from that of the Sun and to clarify the relation between chromospheric strength and age suggested by the work of 0lin.  The present proposal requests observing time to obtain spectra for stars which will help to determine the minimal level of chromospheric activity in this part of the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram.|Y
CSCAD|Evolutionary Study of Late-Typr Single, Dwarf Stars|Andrea K.|Dupree|CFA|We propose to obtain ultraviolet spectra of late-type dwarfs to investigate the presence and structure of chromospheres and coronae as a function of age and rotation rate.|Y
CSCJL|High Dispersion, Short Wavelength Studies of Selected Cool Stars|Jeffery L.|Linsky|Colorado|High resolution spectra of the 1150-2000 A region are enormously valuable for probing outer atmosphere structure in cool stars. For example, such data can be used to separate blends, identify individual emission components in short-period binary systems, determine intensity ratios in close multiplets, estimate reliable emission strengths of lines superimposed on bright stellar continua, and test for the presence or absence of stellar winds at 105 K temperatures. These possibilities are not practical with IUE low dispersion spectra. However, one must pay a steep price to obtain usable high dispersion IUE spectra and the additional dimension of diagnostic information, namely only a handful of the brightest UV sources are accessible even with long (~1 shift) exposure times.  Below we outline an observing program to obtain high-dispersion, short wavelength spectra of 7 stars that we feel are feasible to attempt with practical (i.e., ~7^h exposure times. We propose to use the resulting data to test density-diagnostic line ratios to determine if Wilson-Bappu-type relations apply to transition region (T >= 3x 10^4 K) lines, and to estimate the contributions of the individual stars in close binary systems to the composite UV emission.|Y
CSCRW|Further Studies of the UV Spectra of Late-Type Stars|Robert F.|Wing|Ohio State University|The ultraviolet spectra of normal cool stars (types G, K, and M) will be examined with the IUE satellite to study both the temperature structure and the velocity structure of their outer atmospheres. Low-resolution observations in the shortwavelength region are effective indicators of the range of temperature present, since the region contains strong resonance lines of atoms in several different stages of ionization. High-resolution observations, which are possible only in the long-wavelength region, permit measurements of the velocity differences between the photosphere (absorption lines), chromosphere (sharp Fe II emission lines), and circumstellar shells (absorption components in the Mg II profiles). Some of the high-resolution observations will also be used to complete an atlas of late-type spectra in the 2500- 3000 A region, the exposures for which are sufficiently long to allow the study of atomic and molecular absorption features.  The proposed observations represent a continuation of a study begun under our first-year program LTRFW, and we intend to repeat some of the observations made earlier to look for changes in the temperature or velocity structures over time scales of 1-2 years. New objects on the program will also be included to obtain more complete data on high-luminosity stars, for which existing observations are meager, and on early K giants, in which spectral lines from hot transition-region material either may or may not occur, or may occur with variable intensity. Tentative arrangements have been made for simultaneous ground-based observations of the chromospheric helium line at 10830 A in the near infrared.|Y
CSDCB|Magnetic Variability in Zeta Bootes A|C. Stewart|Bowyer|University of California|The active G8 dwarf xi Boo A was one of the first stars on which the strength and extent of a surface magnetic field was measured. Recent observations have revealed a reduction of at least a factor of 5 in the filling factor of the field. Contemporaneously, the coronal X-ray luminosity of this system was observed at a level less than 10 percent of that observed one year earlier. The CaII H&K emission cores, which arise in the lower chromosphere, have remained unchanged. We propose to observe xi Boo A with IUE to study the changes, if any, in the emission line strengths from the transition region and upper chromosphere. We request a total of four shifts, two during each HEAO-B observing window during the next observing year, for observing xi Boo A, HR8, a star with detectable surface magnetic fields, and two stars of similar spectral types without detectable surface fields.|Y
CSDCS|IUE Observations of Weak G-Band Stars|Christopher|Sneden|University of Texas at Austin|Weak G-band stars are late-type giants having underabundances of carbon and overabundances of nitrogen. The Li abundance in weak G-band stars is linearly anti-correlated with CH deficiency. Li abundance in these stars ranges from log epsilon(Li) of 0.7 to the cosmic value of 3.0.  Determination of Be abundances in weak G-band stars and to see whether there are any correlations between Li and Be abundances and Be and carbon abundances is of considerable importance.  Recent studies indicate that many late-type stars with CNO and/or sprocess abundance peculiarities have low mass companions (McClure et al. (1980)). More recently from IUE observations Bohm-Vitense (1980) has shown further that the companion to the classical barium star zeta Capricorni is a white dwarf. It is of significant astrophysical interest and importance to see whether the weak G-band stars also have white dwarf companions.  We wish to observe a few selected bright weak G-band stars in the ultraViolet using the IUE (1) to search for white dwarf companions, and (2) to determine Be abundances.|Y
CSDGH|Evolutionary Decay of the Chromospheres of G0-G2 Dwarfs|G.

The aim is to determine if a decline in the overall activity and chromospheric properties of 1 solar mass stars can be detected in the fluxes and line ratios of emission lines observable with IUE in the 12002000 A region.|Y

CSDJL|High Resolution Spectra of an Evolved Solar-Like Star, Beta HYI (G2IV)|Jeffery L.|Linsky|Colorado|Beta Hyi (G2 IV) is important to study in order to illuminate the probable fate of the Sun (G2 V) when it will be leaving the main sequence and to understand non-thermal processes in solar-type stars. In an ongoing IUE program, Fredga, Gahm and Dravins are investigating its chromospheric activity, while its photospheric properties are being analyzed using data from ESO. To study also the structure of the upper chromosphere and transition region in Beta Hyi, we propose to obtain one short-wavelength high-dispersion exposure. We argue that this is feasible in about 16-20 hours of low background time available in one ESA shift and two NASA shifts in sequence. We intend to measure the subtle differences in emission line profiles between Beta Hyi, the Sun, and Alpha Cen A (a G2 V star of intermediate age for which excellent spectra are now available) in order to distinguish changes in broadening due to different flow patterns or waves which may depend on stellar age. We also intend to compute a model chromosphere and transition region for Beta Hyi for comparison with models of the Sun and Alpha Cen A, and to search for age-dependent changes in the nonradiative heating rates in the outer atmospheres of these stars.  With such data we can begin to address in a meaningful way how the Sun will evolve.|Y
CSDRS|SWP High Resolution Spectra & Emission Measure Analysis of Yellow Bright Giants with Coronae|Robert E.|Stencel|Colorado|There is now considerable evidence, on the basis of IUE spectra and Einstein X-ray fluxes, that the cool half of the HR diagram can be divided into two regions. The first region, including the dwarfs and yellow giants, contains stars with weak winds and hot outer atmospheres (containing transition regions and coronae). The second region, including the red giants and supergiants, contains stars with strong winds and cool plasma. These two regions have a boundary in which stars with both characteristics occur. We propose to study in detail 4 yellow bright giants and supergiants that have hot outer atmospheres and lie close to or on the dividing line separating these two regions. These stars (Beta Dra, 56 Peg, alpha Aqr, and Beta Cam) were chosen because of their intrinsic interest, previous extensive studies, and because they are bright enough that 15 hour SWP-HI exposures should produce good quality line profiles for a number of important transition region and chromosphere lines.  Our objectives are to compute detailed models for the chromospheres and transition regions of these stars using the strengths and profiles of lines of Mg II, C II, Si II, Si III, C III, C IV, and N V, using density-sensitive line ratios, and an emission measure analysis that incorporates information on line opacities and widths in addition to their fluxes. The aim of this analysis is to determine the energy balance as a function of height in these stars and to compare the derived pressures to those of other stars studied that lie further away from the boundary of these two regions of the HR diagram.|Y
CSDSP|IUE Observations of Stars and X-Ray Sources in an X-Ray Active Region of Orion|S. H.|Pravdo|Cal Tech|We have obtained an X-ray image of a ~ 1 degree square region in Orion, centered ~ 1.5 degrees south of the Trapezium. There are a large number of X-ray sources (~ 22) in this field, many of which we have identified with probable optical counterparts. These stars are part of the young stellar population in Orion and are apparently on the high end of the X-ray luminosity versus spectral type distribution. We propose to observe several of these optical candidates with IUE as well as some comparison stars which are not apparent X-ray sources but with similar spectral types and in the same field. In this way we hope to discern from UVX-ray comparisons why certain stars are strong X-ray emitters while other similar stars are not (e.g. the importance of chromospheric and coronal activity). In addition within the same field a possible region of diffuse X-ray emission near NGC 1999 and Herbig Haro I is also proposed for an IUE observation.|Y
CSDTA|Calibration of the SWP Echelle Mode for Chromospheric Emission Sources|Thomas R.|Ayres|Colorado|I propose to establish an absolute calibration for the SWP echelle mode of IUE that would be useful for chromospheric emission-line stars. In addition propose to study and characterize apparent vidicon artifacts that appear in and near some of the prominent emission features of the 1150-2000 A region, particularly C IV 1548 A. The calibration would be accomplished by a graded sequence of alternating echelle-mode and low-dispersion exposures of the bright, chromospheric emission-line source Capella (alpha Aurigae A). Such a calibration is straightforward, and quite timely in view of the increasing number of long-exposure, SWP echelle-mode observations of cool-star chromospheres that have been attempted in the past, and are contemplated for the future. For aesthetic reasons, the calibration should be obtained during a single, low-noise shift. However, for expediency, many of the objectives could be accomplished satisfactorily during a US #2 shift.|Y
CSDTS|Ultraviolet Observations of Young Field Stars|Theodore|Simon|Hawaii|In order to study the changes in chromospheric activity with stellar age, we propose to obtain IUE spectra of young main sequence field stars of spectral type F7-G2 and to compare these observations with spectra previously obtained of T Tauri stars, Hyades stars, and old solar-type stars. There are at least three spectroscopic criteria to distinguish very young main sequence F-G stars: the intensity of chromospheric emission lines (e.g., Ca II and Mg II); high axial rotation; and high surface abundance of the light elements, such as Li or Be. We have selected for observation a number of field stars judged to be young primarily on the basis of having high Li content, and secondarily on whether they are rapid rotators or exhibit strong Ca II H-K emission reversals. The goal of our proposed IUE observing program is to measure the strengths of the ultraviolet chromospheric and transition region lines (e.g., Mg II, C II-IV, N V) and to derive atmospheric models using non-LTE radiative transfer codes. These chromospheric and transition region models will then be used to calculate radiative cooling curves in order to compare the energy balance and nonradiative heating requirements of young stars with those of old, solar-type stars.|Y
CSEJL|High Dispersion SWP Spectra of Yellow and Red Giants|Jeffrey L.|Linsky|Colorado|We propose to continue our program, in collaboration with 0. Engvold and C. Jordan, to obtain 15 hour SWP high dispersion spectra of the few late-type giants and supergiants observable by IUE. On the basis of low dispersion SWP spectra, Linsky and Haisch (1979) and Simon et al. (1981) have proposed a boundary in the HR diagram separating stars with and without detected emission from 10^5 K plasma. We propose detailed studies of 4 stars -- 2 on either side of the boundary. Our scientific objectives are to derive the distributions of temperature and density for the chromospheres and transition regions (if present). We plan to do this by constructing model chromospheres and transition regions using lines of Mg II, Si II, C II, Si III, C III, C IV, and N V, by an emission measure analysis, and using density-sensitive line ratios. These models will be used to assess the energy balance in order to learn about the outer atmosphere heating mechanisms and wind acceleration mechanisms.|Y
CSELH|Dynamics of Hot Gas Surrounding Hybrid Stars|Lee W.|Hartmann|CFA|IUE Observations have demonstrated that high-temperature (T < 2 x 10 ^6 K) emission can be present In ("hybrid") stars which also exhibit mass loss In cold circumstellar shells (T < 10^6 K; Hartmann,Dupree and Raymond 1980). This provides an important link between solar activity and cool giant mass loss. Further high-dispersion observations showed that the high temperature lines were extremely broad (FWHM ~ 100-200 km s^-1; Hartmann et al. 1981). This line broadening is consistent with at least one theory of mass loss (Hartmann and MacGregor 1980), and clearly demonstrates that there are Important dynamical effects present in the 10 K-emitting regions of lowgravity stars which are not so obviously important In the Sun. Our proposed research program addresses four questions: (1) How common are hybrid atmosphere stars? (2) Are all stars with large wind velocities hybrids? (3) How Is cool wind variability related to high temperature emission line strengths and widths? (4) Are circumstellar wind velocities correlated with line widths of C III, Si III, and C IV?|Y
CSEMG|Magnetic & Chromospheric Synoptic Observations of Late-Type Stars|Mark S.|Giampapa|CFA|We propose to obtain time-resolved, coordinated observations of magnetic flux and the associated chromospheric and transition region line emission for selected active chromosphere stars. The unique data to be obtained in this program will provide a crucial input to theories that describe the heating of stellar chromospheres and coronae. In essence, the results to be acquired through the observations proposed herein will (for the first time) establish a preliminary empirical relationship between stellar magnetic field strengths and magnetic flux, and stellar outer atmospheric line emission. We are presently utilizing a now and successfully demonstrated method to directly detect magnetic fields on stellar surfaces. These results indicate the existence of strong (~ a few kilogauss) magnetic fields that may cover up to 80% of the stellar surface. Moreover, these fields are observed to rapidly (2-3 days) vary in surface coverage. We therefore propose a coordinated IUE ground-based synoptic program to obtain chromospheric-transition region data (with IUE) and magnetic field and flux measurements (ground-based observations) for several stars that exhibit rapidly varying surface field coverages over their rotational periods.  Our IUE observing pattern will primarily consist of low dispersion, SWP observations and high-dispersion, LWR exposures. These data will be obtained simultaneously (or near simultaneously) with groundbased optical and infrared observations. The groundbased data will|Y
CSFHJ|Studies of the Ultraviolet Spectra of Carbon Stars|Hollis R.|Johnson|Indiana University|The IUE satellite will be used to obtain high-resolution LWR spectra of cool carbon stars. Careful identification of spectral features (both absorption and emission) will be made. High resolution observations in the long wavelength region will be used to study the Mg II k-line profile for evidence of circumstellar features and for mass outflow. The width of the emission core may yield the stellar luminosity (by the WilsonBappu effect). If the CII lines at 2325 can be obtained, the electron density will be deduced. The wavelength dependence of the ultraviolet opacity will be studied. Attempts will be made to deduce any other information about the outer atmosphere and chromosphere of these fascinating objects.|Y
CSFJL|UV Variability and Rotational Modulation of T Tauri Stars|Jeffrey L.|Linsky|Colorado - JILA|T Tauri stars show high levels of chromospheric activity and they have the largest surface fluxes of chromospheric and transition region emission lines of any class of stars. (Only the RS CVn binary systems show equivalent levels of emission.) As low mass premain-sequence stars, their outer atmospheres are the precursors of the chromospheres and coronae of main sequence stars and hence are highly relevant to the evolution and causes of such phenomena. The available X-ray data imply that the coronae of T Tauri stars are of small extent compared to their stellar radii, while optical and infrared observations show large extended regions of relatively cool circumstellar gas and dust.  We propose to study the changes in emission lines formed in the upper chromospheres and transition regions of three T Tauri stars (SU Aur, RY Tau, DR Tau) over a period of 5 days. This period was chosen since it is close to the expected rotational period for these stars. The data will be examined for the effects of rotational modulation due to chromospheric structures (plages, active regions) as they pass across the visible disc of the star. Many examples of such behavior are seen in other cool stars. Observation of modulation would demonstrate that the transition region also has a small extent, similar to the coronal findings. Even if significant rotational modulation is not detected, we will examine the nature of any other types of variability detected and deduce the implied constraints on chromospheric structure. To our knowledge there has been no systematic search for variability or rotational modulation in the IUE short-wavelength region for T Tauri stars and this program represents a new approach in the study of these stars. As a byproduct we should obtain the best set of low-dispersion SWP observations of T Tauri stars so far made that will allow detailed modelling of the chromospheric structure of these stars.|Y
CSFKB|The Environment of the Cohen-Schwartz Star|Karl-Heinz|Bohm|Washington|We propose to study with IUE the environment of the Cohen-Schwarz (C-S) star which is the star from which, according to Herbig and Jones, the individual condensations of Herbig-Haro (H-H) objects 1 and 2 are moving radially away with velocities up to 350 kms^-1 In a single SWP spectrum obtained earlier, we found that the immediate environment of the star emits a uv continuum similar to that of an H-H object.  We hope that the proposed observations will answer the following questions: 1. How extended is this diffuse emitting region: 2. How well does the continuum really agree with that of a H-H object? 3.  Should it also be attributed to a two-photon continuum generated behind a shock wave (like it recently has been done for H-H objects)? 4. If the answer to 3. is "yes," what does this tell us about the distribution of shock waves near the C-S star?|Y
CSFNM|The Ultraviolet Energy Distribution of PHI Cassiopeiae|Nancy D.|Morrison|Toledo|The ultraviolet energy distribution of the F01a-type star phi Cassiopeiae will be determined from low-dispersion spectra obtained with both cameras. Together with ground-based fluxes, equivalent widths, and line Profiles, these data will be compared with fluxes predicted by the Kurucz (1979) grid of model atmospheres, with the aim of determining whether a single model can reproduce all the observations. This question is important in the determination of the effective temperature of the star, which is needed for a comparison of the HR diagram of the cluster with evolutionary tracks. If no selfconsistent model can be found for the star, then more sophisticated model atmospheres, including spherical geometry, will be developed.  Since the star is heavily reddened (e(B-V) = 0.50), great care will be needed in determining the interstellar extinction in the ultraviolet. The fact that the color excess is known to be highly uniform within the clutter, however, will allow the extinction to be determined from observations of B-type main-sequence cluster members with accuracy sufficient for a good test of the model atmospheres.|Y
CSFRW|A Search for Molecular Absorption Features in the Photospheric Spectra of Cool Stars|Robert F.|Wing|Ohio State University|The primary goal of the proposed research program is to establish the existence of molecular features in the IUE spectra of cool stars. The identification and measurement of bands from the diatomic molecules commonly found in atmospheres of stars later than GO can provide important information about their photospheres. Various molecular bands are much more sensitive to changes in temperature, gas pressure (and thus luminosity) or elemental abundance ratios than atomic lines and their response to changes in these parameters can be measured with substantially lower spectral resolution. Detection of molecular bands in IUE spectra of cool stars is not straightforward since bands present in the faint continua can easily be hidden or distorted by the numerous atomic photospheric absorption and chromospheric emission lines. However, molecular information can be extracted from these spectra by analyzing sequences (based on temperature, luminosity, and carbon abundance) of low resolution spectra in conjunction with high resolution spectra of many of the same stars. This process will hopefully allow us to identify and measure molecular features in a wide range of late-type stars, including normal giants from K0 to M8 and a representative sample of carbon stars.|Y
CSFTA|Determination of Absolute Velocities for Emission Lines of Late-Type Stars|Thomas R.|Ayres|Colorado-LASP|The recent discovery of redshifted emission lines like Si IV and C IV in the far-ultraviolet spectra of active-chromosphere stars may be an important link with the downflows of 10^5 K material seen commonly in the magnetic loon structures of solar active regions. On the Sun, the net redshifts of the hiqh-excitation species almost certainly result from a continual exchange of plasma between the chromosphere and corona, in which the upleg portion of the circulation is too cool (spicules, for example) or too hot (explosive evaporation, for example) to be visible in the intermediate temperature emissions.  However, the differential redshifts measured in the spectra of other late-type stars may result from a net blueshift of the weak, lowexcitation emission features that are used to provide -an ad hoc zero velocity reference. Furthermore, even if the 10^5 K lines are redshifted in an absolute sense, an outflowing wind at that temperature could absorb some of the emission on the short-wavelength side of the line profile, and thereby give the appearance of a net redshifted feature.  According to the importance of the redshift phenomenon with regard to winds and "antiwinds" in late-type chromospheric emission-line stars, we propose to undertake an extensive observational program with IUE to (1) establish whether the high-excitation lines indeed are redshifted in an absolute sense, (2) distinguish among the several competing hypotheses to explain the redshifts, and (3) study the flow structure in a number of red giants that are known to possess winds of moderate terminal velocity but comparatively low excitation. The observational objectives of the program can be met by obtaining long exposures in the SWP and LWR regions of prototype bright stars whose spectra contain optically thin forbidden and intersystem lines as well as strong permitted transitions that probably are optically thick. The spectra will he taken according to simple procedures that permit the assignment of a sufficiently reliable absolute velocity scale. Finally, the absolute velocity spectra that result from this program will be analyzed in the context of detailed numerical simulations of geometrically extended, expanding chromospheres, in order to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the winds and/or downflows.|Y

We propose an intensive multi-frequency study of this active star during the 1984-85 year.|Y
CSGCI|Ultraviolet Spectra of Young Stars Relevant to Earth's Early Atmosphere|Catherine L.|Imhoff|CSC|Understanding the formation of the earth, the evolution of the atmosphere, and the origin and evolution of life is heavily dependent on our knowledge of the early Sun and its ultraviolet flux. In our earlier work we showed that, when the Sun was several million years old, the solar UV flux was enhanced by several orders of magnitude over present values. Our photochemical calculations indicate that the abundance of oxygen and ozone were much higher than previously estimated. Formaldehyde, an important precursor in the origin of life, can be formed and rain out into the early oceans.  We wish to extend this work to later stages in the Sun's early evolution, from its arrival on the main sequence to an age of 10 years. This period is especially important in establishing the atmospheric conditions just prior to the beginning of life on earth.  We propose to use IUE spectra of young solar-type stars to simulate the evolution of the young Sun's UV spectrum at three epochs from about 10^8 to 10^9 years. We have compiled archival IUE data for 8 young G stars for the analysis. Complete wavelength coverage, from Lyman-alpha to 3200 A, is required due to the wavelength-dependent behavior of the UV spectrum and molecular species involved. However, there are substantial gaps in the archival data, due to the steeply sloped spectra of these cool stars. Therefore we request additional IUE observations of these young G stars for the analysis.|Y
CSGEB|G and Early K Giant UV Continua and Early Emission Line Intensities|Erika|Bohm-Vitense|Washington|The continuum flux around 1950A for cool giants is different for otherwise apparently similar stars. For the Hyades this flux is correlated with the chromospheric emission line intensities. We want to study this correlation for other giants. We want to study the systematic changes in emission line and continuum flux along the G to K giant sequence in order to understand the abrupt changes in continuum flux, CIV emission and v(r) sin i observed to occur at spectral types G5III.|Y
CSGHJ|Studies of the Ultraviolet Spectra of Carbon Stars|Hollis R.|Johnson|Indiana University|The IUE satellite will be used to study the ultraviolet spectra of R and N-type carbon stars, which encompass the luminosity range from giants to supergiants, in order to understand the outer layers of three objects. We propose to concentrate on two aspects of this problem: (1) highdispersion studies of the brightest R stars and (2) the variation with time of the spectrum of the irregular variable TX Psc. High dispersion observations in the long wavelength region of IUE will be obtained for the brightest R stars and used to identify the spectral features in the 2600-3200A range. The spectra will be compared to those of oxygen-rich stars with similar temperatures to ascertain the effects of chemical peculiarities in the outer atmospheres of carbon stars. We intend to obtain spectra of all different population and luminosity types of early R stars and of one late R star -- The only stars bright enough to allow high-dispersion IUE spectroscopy. Detailed models will be constructed of the outer atmospheres of these stars, based on existing photospheric models of Johnson and coworkers, to measure quantitatively the physical conditions in their upper photospheres and chromospheres. We will continue to observe TX Psc to determine the range of variation in its chromospheric emission and to see how this is related to changes in the ultraviolet continuum and optical brightness. Again, detailed chromospheric models will be used as the basis of comparison.|Y
CSGJL|Properties of Stellar Winds: FE II, C II, and Variability|Jeffrey L.|Linsky|Colorado - JILA|We propose to use both archival and new seventh-year high resolution IUE spectra to investigate the cool, extended winds around a sample of late-type giant and supergiant stars. The primary goals of this study are to determine for each star the radial structure of its wind, the primary channels for radiative cooling of its outer atmosphere, and the density and geometrical extent. of its wind. We shall also examine the long-term stability of the wind in a subset of these same stars. The density and geometrical extent of the winds will be estimated from the C II intercombination emission lines near 2325 A., using an improved version of the technique developed by Stencel et al. (1981). Fluxes of the Fe II emission lines, found throughout the long-wavelength region of IUE, will be used in a probability-of-escape modelling of the wind structure. The range of opacities and temperature sensitivities represented by the numerous Fe II lines will allow the computation of models with much greater radial discrimination than is possible solely on the basis of the frequently used Mg II or Ca II resonance lines. The acquisition of wavecal images immediately after each new high resolution spectrum will also allow us to measure very accurate absolute radial velocities of the emission features and thus to determine the speed and radial dependence of the material in the outer layers of these stars.|Y
CSGSB|Coordinated Ultraviolet Spectroscopic and Optical Photometric Observations of Capella|Sallie L.|Baliunas|Harvard CFA-SAO|Recent photoelectric photometry by Dorren and Guinan of Capella (G5-6III + F9-GOIII) confirm the results of earlier photometric studies, that the star is variable in light. Capella (= alpha Aur) has been classified by Hall (1976) as an IRS CVn variable, showing as it does bright chromospheric and coronal emission In addition to visible light modulation. The photometric brightness of Capella, however, appears to be correlated with increasing net HO emission strength. This behavior is unlike "starspot" phenomena reported for the RS CVn binaries which show photometric faintness associated with increased chromospheric emission, interpreted as the presence of optically darker spots with bright ultraviolet emissions from the spots and associated active regions. In order to Investigate the behavior of these unusual light variations, we propose to measure at high resolution the widths, fluxes, and asymmetries of ultraviolet lines formed in the extended atmospheres of both stellar components to detect the presence and character of a stellar wind and change In atmospheric structure when active regions and/or spots are present.  In addition, the strength of the chromospheric and coronal emission in the evolved stars in such a widely-separated binary as Capella remains an enigma We plan to reanalyze extant ultraviolet spectra in light of new information on both the rotation rates of the stars and the visible light variations.|Y
CSGTA|Far-Ultraviolet Fluorescence of Carbon Monoxide|Thomas R.|Ayres|Colorado-LASP|A-X fourth positive bands of carbon monoxide are known to fluoresce strongly in the far-ultraviolet spectra of planetary atmospheres and comet tails, in response to radiative pumping by the solar resonance triplet of neutral oxygen at 1305A.  The fluorescence of the CO fourth positive system also has been observed in the red giant Arcturus, both indirectly and directly. The indirect evidence is the presence of several strong features in IUE low dispersion SWP spectra that are not resolved into individual atomic emission lines in high dispersion observations. The "missing line" phenomenon results from the nature of the fluoresced bands: Many, weak, narrow emission features distributed over an interval that is much larger than the echelle resolution element, but comparable to that of the low dispersion mode. The direct evidence for CO emission comes from a very deep SWP echelle exposure of Arcturus in which faint structure is revealed in the missing line regions. The emission structure in the 1380A interval, in particular, is compatible with the distribution expected for CO pumped by the O I triplet, but the deduced temperature of the absorption region is only 1000 K. This result raises the intriguing possibility that the pumping occurs within a circumstellar shell surrounding Arcturus, rather than by chromospheric radiation penetrating down to the cool layers of the photosphere (which is not expected to attain temperatures below about 2500 K in radiative equilibrium).  I, therefore, am proposing an Archival research project to study CO fluorescence among the cool giants and supergiants using the "missing line" technique. By applying the approach to low dispersion and high dispersion spectra of yellow and red giants of luminosity class III to I, I hope to answer, empirically, the question of where in the outer atmosphere of these stars the CO molecules are pumped by chromospheric radiation. Furthermore, I intend to explore the implications of the CO emission for deducing physical properties in the extended outer envelopes of the late-type giants.|Y
CSGTS|Chromospheric Activity, Tio Strength and Spectral Types in M Giants|Thomas Y.|Steiman-Cameron|Cal Tech-MT.Wil|In an continuation of a study begun during the 6th year of the IUE guest observer program the IUE satellite will be used to study the ultraviolet spectra of cool giant stars that have well-determined angular diameters and effective temperatures. The stars to be observed have spectral classes ranging from K3 through M6 and are of luminosity class III. Low resolution observations in the long wavelength region will be made in order to study the photospheric continuum radiation in the UV and to determine the level of chromospheric activity in these stars. The absolute flux, as well as the slope of the continuum in the wavelength region 2200-3000 A, should be a sensitive probe of the extent of nonradiative heating in the upper photosphere. Chromospheric activity will be examined for the range of spectral subclasses observed to determine if the degree of chromospheric activity differs for stars of the same effective temperature. The Possibility exists that such a differential level of chromospheric activity could lead to the inhibition of TiO formation in the upper photosphere. Preliminary results from IUE observations made during this past year appear to support this hypothesis. This possibility will be examined along with the resultant consequences for comparisons of observed TiO bandstrengths with model predictions.|Y
CSHDB|K Giant Spectra for Stellar Population Models|David|Burstein|Arizona State University|The near ultraviolet region (2000-3000 A) is a key to the interpretation of the composite spectra of old stellar populations, especially as regards astrophysically-interesting stellar components near or above the main sequence turnoff. Realistic modelling of this region requires a library of standard star spectra for which temperature, metallicity and gravity are well established. Such a library is being established in the optical and near-infrared; we propose here to begin to establish a compatible library in the ultraviolet. These observations will be essential in the interpretation of galaxy spectra returned by Space Telescope and the ASTRO missions.|Y
CSHDH|Observations of Vega-Type Circumstellar Nebulae|Doyal A.|Harper|Chicago|We propose to use IUE to search for an ultraviolet marker for the extended material which causes the intense infrared emission found by IRAS around the nearby stars alpha PsA, Beta Pic, and Epsilon Eri. These observations will test for fluorescence from gas phase molecules and atoms found in cometary halos (e.g., H2, OH, CO, OI and Cl) as well as reflection from particulate material. Once a UV marker is established, it can be used to probe the geometry and physical condition of the emitting material. These sources are expected to be very faint in the UV, so anticipated exposure times are long.|Y
CSHHJ|The Carbon Proto-Planetary Nebula HD 59643|Hollis|Johnson|Indiana University|The IUE satellite will be used to obtain high-resolution LWP and SWP spectra of the unusual cool carbon stars HD 59643, which appears to be a proto-planetary nebula. We should be able to confirm or reject the binary hypothesis for the unusual appearance of this fascinating object. From these spectra, accurate identification of spectral features (both absorption and emission) will be made. High resolution observations will be used to examine line profiles for evidence of circumstellar features and mass outflow. The electron density will be deduced from the C III and Si III lines near 1900 A and the CII lines at 2325 A (if these can be obtained). Attempts will be made to deduce other information about the outer atmosphere, circumstellar shell, and mass flow.|Y
CSHJL|High Resolution Spectroscopy of Late K and M Supergiants|Jeffrey|Linsky|University of Colorado|The ultraviolet spectrum of alpha Ori (M2 Iab) in unique in comparison to spectra of other M stars previously observed with IUE due to the great breadth and frequently strong self-reversals of the Fe II emission lines in the 2200-3200 A region. However no other stars of its spectral type have yet been wellobserved at high resolution with IUE. We propose to obtain images, exposed to properly record these Fe II lines, of two stars of very similar spectral type and luminosity class to alpha Ori to determine whether these lines and the chromosphere that produces them are unique to alpha Ori or are examples of a more general phenomenon. The long double-shift (13-15 hour) exposures required to obtain properly exposed LWP high-resolution spectra of the next brightest M supergiants (3-4 magnitudes dimmer than alpha Ori will be obtained during sequential ESA-US1 shifts. These spectra will also be used to estimate the Ly-alpha flux from these stars, through measurements of the two Fe II fluorescent lines near 2508 A. Ly-alpha is not directly observable in these stars due to extensive circumstellar and interstellar opacity. Modelling of the Al II (UVI) line and analysis of the C II UV 0.01 emission line multiplet will be performed to further characterize the chromospheres of these stars. Estimates of the electron density in, and the geometric extent of, these chromospheres will be produced from these data using well established techniques.|Y
CSIDY|Oscillator Strenghts for SI II|Donald G.|York|Chicago|Studies of nucleosynthetic histories of high z galaxies may reveal much about the history of star and galaxy formation. In particular the initial mass function may be reflected in the abundances, because of the different products of stars of different masses.  Since QSO absorption systems contain metals in many cases, and since they we often blends of narrow components covering 500- 1500 Kin s^-1, it is likely that they wise in active star bursts, i.e., forming galaxies at z= 1 to 3.5. Thus, studies of nucleosynthetic "natural groups" of elements in QSO absorption line spectra may reveal much about galaxy formation.  While the observations of species from certain natural groups are now feasible, the absence of exact knowledge of the oscillator strengths of Si II inhibits progress In this area.  We propose to use well established observing and interpretive techniques to obtain these f-values. Existing date on QSO absorption lines can be immediately turned into abundances once these values are available.|Y
CSIHJ|The Carbon Proto-Planetary Nebula HD 59643|Hollis R.|Johnson|Indiana University|The IUE satellite will be used to obtain high-resolution LWP spectra of the unusual cool carbon star HD 59643 (R9, C6,2), which appears to be a protoplanetary nebula or an interacting binary system. These spectra will enable us to understand the nature of this fascinating object, which may be in a stage of rapid evolution. High-resolution LWP and SWP spectra have been taken with IUE during the current season (late November 1985); however, recent high-resolution spectra in the visible taken in support of these IUE observations resemble those of a K giant with no molecular bands. The possibility of rapid spectral change makes HD 59643 an object of high priority. Identification of spectral features (both absorption and emission) will be made. High resolution line profiles will be examined for evidence of circumstellar features and mass outflow. Attempts will be made to deduce other information about the outer atmosphere, circumstellar shell, and mass flow.|Y
CSIJL|Ultraviolet Emission from Cool Stars with Measured Magnetic Fields|Jeffrey L.|Linsky|Colorado - JILA|We propose to obtain new UV spectra of about 11 highly active late-type dwarfs and to reanalyze spectra of roughly 40 stars from the IUE archives to explore the relationships between chromospheric and transition-region line emission and surface magnetic flux measurements which we have made. We are presently engaged in a program to detect photospheric magnetic field strengths and fractional area coverages, using proven, advanced techniques, for a broad range of G, K and M stars. Over 50 measurements have been made. The relationships we find between the magnetic parameters and UV line fluxes will provide important input to theories of nonradiative heating of stellar atmospheres and dynamo activity in late-type stars. By studying stars over a broad range of physical parameters, we may be able to determine the mechanisms by which the magnetic energy is deposited in stellar upper atmospheres, leading to the development of realistic, multicomponent stellar atmosphere models. Similarly, by analyzing magnetic activity for stars of widely varying temperature, mass, age, gravity, and rotation, we will be able to test various theories of magnetic dynamos and stellar activity in detail. These studies will lead to a vastly improved understanding of how magnetic flux is generated, and how it affects the structure and energy balance of stellar photospheres, chromospheres, transition regions, and coronae.|Y
CSITS|Comparison of Gas Abundances in Oxygen-Rich and Carbon-Rich Circumstellar Envelopes|Theodore P.|Snow|Colorado - CASA|We propose to determine the compositions of two very important types of interstellar grains, oxygen-type silicates and carbon-type grains, by deriving the elemental depletions in the circumstellar envelopes where these grams form. After obtaining high-resolution IUE spectra of binary cool-supergiant plus hot-star systems, and after retrieving relevant archival spectra of similar binaries, we will measure the gaseous abundances of many atomic and molecular species. From curve-of-growth analysis of the circumstellar lines that can be seen in absorption against the hot star, we will not only calculate the depletions of elements relative to undepleted sulphur and zinc, but we will also correlate the abundance of the key molecule CO with the abundances of the depleted species. Thus we can infer the composition of grains and the amount of grams, together with their dependences upon the amount of free CO, in a variety of circumstellar environments. Our program objects, which consist of stars that inject substantial quantities of matter into the interstellar medium, possess different abundance classes, spectral classes and luminosity subclasses These differences, as well as differences in the circumstellar UV flux from the hot-star, may result In the the formation of different amounts and types of grains; we will obtain data on a carbon star binary and on several M supergiant systems known as VV Cephei stars in order to examine In detail possible dependences of grain formation upon these varying parameters. Most significantly, though, we can use the amount of the depletions that are characteristic of individual grain types in order to calculate the fraction of the general interstellar grain mixture that is composed of both oxygen-type and carbon-type grains.|Y
CSJAB|High Dispersion Study of Coronal K Bright Giants|Alexander|Brown|Colorado|We propose to investigate the outer atmospheric structure of the coronal stars that were discovered in our earlier distance-limited survey of early K bright giants ( Program KGHJL ), Transition-region plasma was found to be normally present irk the outer atmospheres of these KII stars, but while approximately half showed hybridchromospheric structure the rest apparently possessed a coronal-type of outer atmospheric structure. We intend to obtain deep LWP-HI spectra of two of these coronal stars to see if high velocity wind absorption features are present in the wings of their MgII h and k lines and to obtain a deep SWP-HI spectrum of the brightest coronal star to measure the profiles of a range of emission lines formed at different temperatures. Chromospheric and transition-region models will be calculated and compared with our earlier models for hybrid-chromosphere stars.|Y
CSJJB|Hydrogen Lyman Alpha Enission From High Radial Velocity Stars|Jay A.|Bookbinder|Colorado|The H I Lyman-alpha line is probably the most important cooling channel for transition regions in late-type stars, yet it is also the least studied line in the far UV. Accurate intrinsic stellar line profiles would be of immense use both as a diagnostic of stellar transition regions and for studies of the local interstellar medium (LISM), and they could in addition be used to determine the total Ly-alpha flux from low dispersion observations. However, the absorption of most of the stellar flux by interstellar material and the high geocoronal background in IUE seriously complicate the analysis of this line.  It is possible to circumvent, to a large extent, the influence of the LISM on the intrinsic stellar profile by observing stars with radial velocities high enough to Doppler shift a significant fraction of the emission line out of the LISM absorption core. We have therefore selected 13 stars, covering a range of spectral types and luminosity classes, with radial velocities > 100 km/sec (corresponding to 0.4 A at 1216 A), for which we propose to obtain low dispersion observations in order to determine the Ly-alpha fluxes. These fluxes will be the best possible estimate of the true stellar Ly-alpha flux because the ISM attenuation is minimized. These observations will then be used to determine exposure times (on the order of 8 - 20 hours) for an 11th year IUE program of high dispersion observations to determine the line profiles.|Y
CSJRS|The Ultraviolet Circumstellar Shell of Alpha Ori|Robert E.|Stencel|Colorado - CASA|We propose off-source observations of the circumstellar shell of a Orionis to attempt to detect resonantly scattered chromospheric emission in the Mg II h and k lines at 2800A, as well as the Mg I resonance line at 2852A and the S I resonance features at 1820A. We estimate that moderate duration exposures with the LWP camera at low resolution, with the aperture offset 10 arcsec from the star, should yield detectable flux. This is based on chromospheric models and previous optical observations of the K I resonance line (7699 Angstroms) which is known to extend 50 arcsec from the star. These observations should enable the first direct measurement of the column densities of majority species in the CS shell of alpha Ori at large distances, and will result in much tighter constraints on current stellar mass loss and wind models than are available at present. To the best of our ability to judge, all previous exposures with IUE, except for one in 1978, have been made "on-source". This important early experiment deserves follow-up.|Y
CSKBB|By Draconis Stars|Bernard W.|Bopp|Toledo|An optical spectroscopic survey of dK-M stars has resulted in the discovery of several new H-alpha emission objects. Available optical data suggest these stars have a level of chromospheric activity midway between active BY Dra stars and quiet dM's. These "marginal" BY Dra stars are single objects that have rotation velocities slightly higher than that of quiet field stars but below that of active flare/BY Dra objects. The marginal BY Dra stars provide us with a class of objects rotating very near a "trigger velocity" (believed to be 5 km/s) which appears to divide active flare/BY Dra stars from quiet dM's. UV data on Mg II emission fluxes and strength of transition region features such as C IV will serve to fix activity levels in the marginal objects and determine chromosphere and transition-region heating rates. Simultaneous optical magnetic field measures will be used to explore the connection between fieldstrength/filling-factor and atmospheric heating. Comparison of these data with published information on active and quiet dM stars will yield information on the character of the stellar dynamo as it makes a transition from "low" to "high" activity.|Y
CSKHJ|The Upper Atmospheres of Late M Stars|Hollis R.|Johnson|Indiana University|The ultraviolet spectra of late-type giant stars exhibit considerable variation from star to star, apparently related both to the level of chromospheric activity and to the physical state of the chromospheric gas. In addition to the well known decrease in Mg II emission with decreasing effective temperature, there are changes in the strengths and possibly the optical depths of the Fe II lines, and systematic changes in electron density and temperature along the spectral sequence. In addition. there are important differences in both photospheric Fe I absorption lines and Fe II emission lines between M giants and carbon stars. Our goal is to extend our understanding of the variation in chromospheric structure with temperature to the coolest M giants (M6-M8) and to reproduce the observed UV spectra of the upper photospheres and low chromospheres of cool M giants through theoretical models.|Y
CSKJE|Chromospheric Variability in M Giants|Joel A.|Eaton|Indiana University|We have studied the constancy of chromospheric emission in M-giant semi-regular variables, finding a wide range of variability. In some, the chromospheric luminosity is practically constant, while In others it changes abruptly by factors of order 2. Only one star observed had changes that might be associated with shock heating as in Mira variables. To study the cause of these variations, we propose obtaining further observations of these stars to determine whether changes in chromospheric emission are associated with pulsations or are random. We plan to observe (1) several SRb variables over a full "period" to see if pulsationally driven shock waves may be causing the changes in chromospheric heating already observed and (2) a a couple of warmer, apparently constant M giants to see what the level of chromospheric variability is for the cooler equivalents of alpha Boo and alpha Tau.|Y
CSKTA|Sleuthing the Dynamo|Thomas R.|Ayres|Colorado - CASA|Long-term cycles of "activity", analogous to the 11-year sunspot cycle, have been discovered on a number of late-type dwarf stars through systematic groundbased surveys of the Ca II HK "S-index". The Ca II emission forms over a diverse range of chromospheric structures, and thus provides a broad view of the areas of the stellar surface disturbed by magnetic activity. In contrast, spectral signatures of activity in the vacuum ultraviolet - like Si IV 1400 and C IV 1550 - form exclusively in the high-excitation layers of the stellar outer atmosphere: the modulation of these emissions over a stellar cycle mirror the changing area of the regions most strongly affected by concentrated fields. Thus, comparisons between low-excitation, chromospheric diagnostics - like Ca II and high-excitation, transition-zone emissions - like Si IV and C IV - provide insight into the relative surface distributions of large scale plage and network compared with small-scale, concentrated active regions.  We believe that the development of a complete theory of the stellar magnetic "dynamo" requires a comprehensive understanding of the surface distributions of magnetic regions throughout activity cycles. Thus, we propose to continue a program we began in the Ninth Episode to study the properties of far-UV spectra of representative late-type stars over their cycles. Our objective is not to measure the cycle periods, themselves; that is better done with Ca II photometry from the ground. Instead, we wish to record representative emission levels of each star throughout at least one complete cycle: our goal is to compare chromospheric and transition-zone emissions in flux-flux diagrams; in particular, the trajectory followed by a star over its cycle relative to the slope defined by the broad behavior of many stars of different mean activity levels. Differences in the slopes are signatures of 'nonlinear' behavior in the dynamo; important clues to confront theoretical models of dynamo action.|Y
CSLLW|Dust Nucleation and the Efficiency of Grain Formation: Clues From the Unstable Wind of l2 Pup|Lee Anne|Willson|University of Colorado|Mass loss from Mira variables and the closely related OH-IR stars terminates the AGB evolution of most low and intermediate mass stars and provides most of the mass return to the interstellar medium. The mass loss mechanism is a combination of pulsation with radiative forces acting on dust formed in cool regions of the dynamic atmosphere. Previous IUE observations at low resolution, compared with dynamical atmosphere models by Bowen, have led us to the realization that L2 Pup provides a unique opportunity to study the mass loss process, because it is marginally able to sustain a dusty wind due to its short period, low luminosity, and low metallicity. L2 Pup alternates between states of high and low dust production, and recently began an episode of enhanced dusty mass loss. We propose to observe L2 PUP in high dispersion at regular intervals over one pulsation cycle. We will use dynamic atmosphere models combined with radiative transfer calculations to obtain from the MgII line data information concerning the conditions under which dust grains are forming. Contemporaneous ground based spectroscopy and spectropolarimetry will be carried out to provide further constraints on the models.|Y
CSLTA|Sleuthing the Dynamo II|Thomas R.|Ayres|Colorado - CASA|A key puzzle in modern astrophysics is the nature of the solar hydromagnetic dynamo: the direct cause of the 11-year sunspot cycle, and indirect source of the ebb and flow of chromospheric and coronal activity. New clues have come with the discovery of analogous long-term cycles on a number of other late-type dwarfs through systematic monitoringsurveys of Ca II K. However, the low-excitation Ca II emission does not form exclusively in areas disturbed by magnetic flux, and thus provides an incomplete proxy view of the dynamogenerated fields. In contrast, high-excitation vacuum-ultraviolet emissions - like Si IV 1400 and C IV 1550 - form entirely in the regions most strongly affected by concentrated magnetic flux (spots, plage, and network). The modulations of these emissions over a stellar cycle directly mirror the changing face of the dynamo.  We believe that the development of a complete theory of the dynamo requires a comprehensive database concerning the superficial manifestations of activity cycles. Particularly critical are far-UV spectra from the cycle maxima and minima of representative near-solar stars. We have received time in previous episodes to collect far-UV spectra of a small sample of key stars for that purpose. In addition, we calibrated and measured 2,500 SWP-LOs of late-type stars from the Archives, and published preliminary emission histories for 10 stars.  Since the IUE continues to function well, it would be a tragic scientific oversight not to continue systematic monitoring of at least a few late-type stars for as long as the satellite remains healthy. Owing to the long-term nature of the program, we are requesting two-year status for it.|Y
CSMAD|Pulsation-Driven Wind from a Yellow Supergiant|Andrea K.|Dupree|Harvard SAO - CFA|The old, low mass supergiant, 89 Her (F2 Ia), has shown periodic light variations as measured by our 0.25m Automated Photoelectric Telescope (APT). Spectra of H-alpha and Mg II reveal broad asymmetric profiles indicating rapid mass outflow with a velocity comparable to the escape velocity from the star. This is extremely unusual for a cool luminous star. We propose to continue photometric monitoring of 89 Her with the APT, and to obtain high resolution Mg II spectra, H-alpha and Ca II K spectra, while sampling 89 Her over its pulsation period. This star is believed to be a precursor to a planetary nebula, being a post-AGB object that happens to have been caught in the process of transformation as it evolves rapidly to higher temperatures across the top of the HR diagram. Our proposed observations should reveal the response of the atmosphere to the pulsation of the photosphere, and development of an extended atmosphere allowing the easy escape of material from the star, the presence of circumstellar material, and allow the determination of the velocity profile in a cool stellar wind.  This program capitalizes on IUE's capability for long-term observations, uses a modest amount of shift 2 time, and represents the first attempt to probe continuous ultraviolet spectroscopic observations of a supergiant that is a post-AGB star. Simultaneous groundbased photometry and spectroscopy are available.|Y
CSMPJ|Understanding the Circumstellar Shell of the Carbon Star Tx psc|Phipip G.|Judge|Colorado - JILA|Recent work with the IRAS satellite and with sub-millimetre telescopes has revealed that many optically visible carbon stars are believed to be in a post-Mira phase of evolution on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB), presently surrounded by a "detached shell" of gas and dust resulting from an earlier period of rapid mass loss. TX Psc is the brightest "detached shell" source in the UV.  We propose to make LWP observations of one of the optically brightest carbon stars, TX Psc, including a joint NASA/ESA LWP-HI exposure of > 16 hours. Our aim is to obtain high quality profiles of the highly variable Mg II h and k lines for comparison with an earlier LWP-HI exposure of 13.5 hours. The profiles and their differences from the previous exposure will permit us to study conditions within several stellar radii of the star, especially the dynamical structure of the inner circumstellar shell. These regions are crucial for understanding the mass-loss mechanisms and their relationship to the evolution of AGB stellar winds. With the new data we will test current models of mass loss and stellar evolution on the AGB based upon IRAS data. and recent measurements from sub-mm telescopes.|Y
CSMRS|Mapping the UV Circumstellar Nebulae of Cool Stars|Robert E.|Stencel|Colorado - CASA|We propose to continue experimentation with a promising technique of offsource observing with IUE, to pursue direct detection and analysis of reflection nebulae surrounding cool, evolved stars. With CMKRS observing time in 1988 and some Discretionary time in 1989, we have demonstrated that: (a) the instrumental scattered light profile of IUE depends on the effective temperature of the star in question, and (b) that red supergiants like Antares and Betelgeuse show signal well in excess of the instrumental levels, at distances of 10 to 20 arc-seconds from the star. This signal is circumstellar in origin, and will permit new estimates of density and temperature structure in the circumstellar nebula.. However, to secure these results, additional calibration and circumstellar sources need to be observed.|Y

CSNMS|Variable Extinction in Hot Stars with Circumstellar Dust|Michael L.|Sitko|U Cincinnati|Long-term changes in the UV flux of hot stars with circumstellar dust shells will be examined using spectra taken one decade apart. Changes in the extinction will allow a direct determination of the optical characteristics of newly formed/destroyed dust particles Comparing spectra of the target objects at different epochs will provide a means of determining the extinction curves which bypasses any uncertainty introduces by mismatching the spectral type of the target star with the comparison star. The role of adsorbed CO molecules on grains will be examined further for one of the program stars.|Y
CSPGC|Emission Line Regions in Cool Hydrogen Deficient Carbon Stars|Geoffrey C.|Clayton|Colorado - CASA|The highly variable R Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars, and the hydrogen deficient carbon (HdC) stars are thought to be related because of their similar chemical compositions, effective temperatures, space and velocity distributions and absolute magnitudes. The major difference between these stars is that RCB stars produce large amounts of dust and HdC stars don't. The "eclipses" caused during RCB declines allow us to study their emission line regions. However, they can be studied at maximum light in the far-UV where the stellar continuum has become extremely faint. We propose to search for emission line regions in the HdC stars to see if they also share this characteristic of RCB stars. We also propose to improve the quality of data existing for R CrB so that emission line data for both RCB and HdC stars can be analyzed to determine the temperatures and densities in the emission producing regions.|Y
CTOTA|Coronal Topology|Thomas R.|Ayres|Colorado - CASA|The configuration of the high-excitation emitting regions oil the surfaces of the RS Canum Venaticorum binaries has been the subject of considerable debate over the past decade. Are the UV and X-ray bright structures of the subgiant primaries relatively compact, surface-hugging features analogous to the magnetic arcades of solar active regions? Or, do they extend to considerable altitudes, possibly interacting with their counterparts from the NIS secondary star? Given the practical difficulties of directly resolving the UV and X-ray surface morphology of a distant star, one must resort to indirect diagnostics. The most useful proxies are: (1) spectral imaging; and (2) "rotational modulations" of inhomogeneous brightness distributions. The techniques are best suited to the fastest- rotating objects, which conveniently also tend to be the most "active" owing to the catalyzing effect of rotation on the generation of magnetic flux in convecting stars.  We propose to obtain a unique medium-term (months) sampling of the UV emissions of four bright RS CVn variables, and the related object alpha Aur, in concert with the near-continuous record of coronal intensities provided by the ALEXIS EUV sky-monitor. Our objective is to study the three-dimensional structure of hyperactive atmospheres in their most favorable light.|Y
CVBCW|Ultraviolet Observations of Cataclysmic Variables and Related Objects|Chi-Chao|Wu|CSC|We propose to observe dwarf novae, old novae, symbiotic variables, related stars such as hot white dwarfs and subdwarfs, and supernovae, novae and transient X-ray sources when opportunities arise. The 2200 A feature will be used to estimate the interstellar and/or circumstellar reddening and monitor the possible dust formation in the nova and supernova envelopes. The dereddened ultraviolet flux distribution will allow us to estimate the bolometric correction and, therefore, the luminosity of the systems, and to study the sources which produce and maintain the radiation and the mechanisms which are responsible for the outbursts. Models will be computed to investigate the structure of the accretion disk in dwarf nova systems. Line identification will be attempted on the supernova spectra to check the validity of the fluorescence model, to monitor the changing physical conditions in the envelope, and to explore the abundance anomalies in the supernova ejecta. The constant luminosity phase of a nova and the temperature of the young nova remnant, which are important in our understanding of the outburst mechanism and the post-outburst evolution, will be investigated. We also plan to carry out simultaneous observations with the X-ray experiments on HEAO-B. We expect these studies to provide new insight into the late evolution of close binary systems (novae, dwarf novae, symbiotic variables, transient X-ray sources, and, possibly, Type I supernovae), into the mechanisms involved during explosively rapid variation, and into the replenishment of the interstellar medium.|Y
CVBDL|Ultraviolet Spectroscopy of Symbiotic Stars|David L.|Lambert|Texas|This proposal describes a program of ultraviolet spectroscopy of the symbiotic stars, recurrent and old novae. Low resolution spectra should provide both the emission line spectrum of the hot gas in these systems and the continuous spectrum of the hot (T ~ 10^5 K) star in the binary system. Selected stars will also be observed at high resolution in order to obtain useful line- profile information. Some stars will also be observed from the McDonald Observatory to obtain complementary spectrophotometry.  The ultraviolet spectrum and - when available - the groundbased observations will be combined to obtain information on the physical structure of these binary systems and the chemical composition of the surrounding nebula.|Y
CVBJG|Observations of Galactic Novae|John S.|Gallagher|Illinois|We propose that galactic novae brighter than about visual magnitude 8 be observed as objects of opportunity with the IUE. Ultraviolet spectrophotometry appropriately spaced in time throughout the nova's active period will provide measurements of the shift of luminosity into the ultraviolet, absorption and emission line strengths, and may be sensitive to the early phases dust formation in the ejecta. When combined with ground-based optical and infrared observations (which we would obtain as a part of this project) the data can be used to model the outburst and thereby determine important physical characteristics of the nova such as the energy budget, chemical abundances of the critical CNO elements, mass ejection rates, line formation mechanisms, and dust condensation process.|Y
CVBJN|Exploring Selected Problems in the Dynamics of Close Binary Systems|J.|Nelson|UC Berkeley|Abstract unavailable|Y
CVBJO|Ultraviolet Observations of Cataclysmic Variables in Their Non-Eruptive States|J. Beverly|Oke|Cal Tech|We propose to combine ultraviolet observations of cataclysmic variable stars with our ground-based optical and near-infrared measurements to study the bolometric magnitudes and spectral energy distributions of these objects in their non-eruptive states. The IUE will be used to acquire low-resolution spectra from 1150 A to 3200 A for a sample of cataclysmic variable stars brighter than about fourteenth magnitude. The aim of the study is to understand the physical processes in these objects and their evolutionary history.  We request 5 shifts for this program.|Y
CVBPS|UV Observations of Selected Cataclysmic Variables|Paula|Szkody|Washington|The cataclysmic variables are composed of dwarf novae, novae, recurrent novae and novae-like systems. All of these types appear to contain a secondary star transferring matter to a white dwarf which leads to a disk, hot spot or accretion area which is a dominant source of light in the visual and UV. The basic cause of the differences among these systems is not totally understood but possibly is connected with different excitation conditions or rates of mass transfer.  Due to the hot gas the peak of the flux distribution occurs in the UV. Thus IUE observations would determine a T, optical thickness and when correlated with existing visual and IR data on these systems would enable a better fit to existing models for the disk or accretion area. If the various systems can be observed at both maximum and minimum states, the changes in T, size and optical thickness will yield an understanding of what is occurring in the accretion area during the outburst and why such large differences in the outburst exist among the cataclysmic variables. Line fluxes would corroborate or invalidate the previous use of black bodies or SG atmospheres to fit the distributions of these objects and yield information as to the excitation conditions and existence of coronae above the disks.|Y
CVCAH|Ultraviolet Light Curves of Eclipsing Dwarf Novae|Albert V.|Holm|CSC|We propose to obtain orbital light curves of the eclipsing dwarf novae systems U Geminorum and EM Cygni from low dispersion spectra in the wavelength range 2000 A to 1150 A. These observations represent a continuation of our pioneering work in UV observations of dwarf novae (Holm and Gallagher 1974; Wu 1976). The variation of light as the hot spot and portions of the accretion disk are eclipsed will increase our understanding of the physics of the accretion disk and of the mass transfer process in these systems.  The observational technique that will be used for these studies is to obtain multiple spectra on a single image by offsetting the telescope pointing along the direction of the major axis of the large aperture. This technique will greatly increase the fraction of the cycle that will be covered with a phase resolution in excess of 0.1 and it will assure that the critical phases are observed. The spectra will be extracted from the resulting images by fitting sums of Gaussian functions to cuts across the dispersion.|Y
CVCCW|Target of Opportunity Observations of Novae and X-Ray Novae|Chi-Chao|Wu|CSC|We propose to continue our program to observe novae, recurrent novae and X-ray novae when outburst events occur. By obtaining spectra at visual maximum, periodically during the post maximum decay, and, if possible, during the pre-maximum rise, we will follow the evolution of the continuum and the line spectra. For both novae and X-ray novae low dispersion spectra will enable us to derive the interstellar absorption (from the middle UV graphite absorption feature and from ratios of line strengths) from which the distance can be estimated. The time sequence of de-reddened spectra will yield information on the evolution of effective temperature, luminosity, physical conditions in the source, and abundances of elements. This time sequence will also permit dust formation in the expanding envelope to be studied. High dispersion spectra, if feasible, will be obtained to refine our knowledge of physical conditions. These data will be integrated with existing data for four novae and three X-ray novae to explore differences and similarities and to distinguish between models of the outburst mechanism.  We also propose to obtain post-outburst spectra of Nova Cygni 1978 and WZ Sge for comparison with the physical conditions in outburst.  Since two of the proposers are IUE Resident Astronomers, they will be able to respond rapidly to obtain observations during the critical early phases of the outburst.|Y
CVCDL|UV Spectroscopy of Symbiotic Stars, Recurrent and Old Novae|David L.|Lambert|Texas|I propose to obtain low resolution ultraviolet spectra of two magnetic white dwarfs. For one of these stars, the main point is to search for evidence of elements other than hydrogen in the spectrum, and to improve the data on which magnetic modelling is based. The other star is the remarkable high-field (B >= 10^8 gauss) white dwarf GD229, which has a unique spectrum of strong, broad lines. It is hoped that an ultraviolet spectrum will make it possible to understand the spectrum of this star.|Y
CVCFC|UV Observations of X-Ray Emitting Cataclysmic Variable Stars|France Anne|Cordova|Lanl|We propose to observe in the ultraviolet the cataclysmic variables recently discovered to be X-ray sources using the Einstein Observatory (Cordova, Mason, and Nelson 1979). Our intention is to measure the luminosity function of this class of stars at all wavelengths.  We find that the ratio of the hard X-ray to the visual luminosity of these stars is correlated with X-ray intensity. This correlation may be due to either a wide range of mass accretion rates (coupled with distance effects) or a difference in magnetic field strengths among the cataclysmic variables. These models predict very different ultraviolet spectra, so it should be possible to distinguish between them using the IUE Observatory.  We also propose to observe the optical counterpart of the low luminosity X-ray source 2S 1822-371 to investigate the effects of X-ray heating in this system, and to compare the UV spectrum to that of cataclysmic variables.|Y
CVCPS|UV Study of Short Period Cataclysmic Variables (Su Uma and Am Her Stars)|Paula|Szkody|Washington|The AM Her and SU UMa systems comprise 2 small subsets of the general population of cataclysmic binaries. All of the members of these 2 groups are close binaries with periods <= 3 hours. They are similar to the typical U Gem star in that they contain a white dwarf and late main sequence star. However, the 4AM Her stars are distinguished by large magnetic fields which cause accretion funnels rather than disks while the SU UMa stars show supermaxima cycles which are brighter and longer and more periodic than the typical dwarf nova outburst. Previous UV observations of AM Her and dwarf novae have shown that a large portion of the light from these systems is emitted in the UV and originates from the disk or accretion funnel.  The existing IUE observations of AM Her have restricted the models of the accretion column. To test the theory further and to learn more about the accretion funnel in general, IUE observations of the other 3 members of the class are proposed.  The causes of the supermaxima and superhumps in the SU UMa groups are not understood. By comparison with existing UV data on normal dwarf novae the proposed IUE observation of this group will determine if differences in the disk conditions or mass accretion rate could be responsible.|Y
CVCRP|Time Resolved Spectrophotometry of UX UMA|Robert J.|Panek|Penn State University|As the brightest eclipsing system among the close binaries of the cataclysmic variable type, UX UMa offers unique possibilities for time resolved study. We propose to obtain time resolved spectrophotometry of UX UMa throughout the orbital cycle. These UV observations will remove uncertainties in the present models of this system by extending the baseline in wavelength for analysis of flux distributions and line spectrum. The IUE is able to time resolve all major features in the light curve.  The spectra will be obtained at low dispersion in the short wavelength range 2000 to 1150A. We intend to obtain multiple spectra on a single image by offsetting the telescope pointing along the direction of the major axis of the large aperture. This technique will greatly increase the fraction of the cycle that will be covered with a phase resolution in excess of 0.1 and it will assure that the critical phases are observed. The spectra will be extracted from the resulting images by fitting sums of Gaussian functions to cuts across the dispersion.|Y
CVCRW|UV Spectroscopy of the GK PER/DQ Her Novae Shells|R. E.|Williams|Arizona|One of the questions that has been central to discussions of the nova outburst concerns the heavy element abundances in novae. Current theoretical models indicate that the outburst characteristics should be related to the CNO abundances. The study of old nova shells is probably the most reliable method of establishing abundances. During the past few years, we have obtained optical spectra of a number of nova shells, and have found that (a) many novae have CNO/H abundances 100 times solar, and (b) the physical conditions in some of the shells are very bizarre, e.g., highly ionized, but extremely cold (<500 K).  The shells around GK Per and DQ Her are the brightest of all the shells, and may be detectable in the UV with IUE. A knowledge of the UV emission-line fluxes of the shells would be valuable in establishing element abundances and physical conditions because of the many ions that radiate in the UV, but not the visible. I would like to obtain large aperture, low dispersion IUE spectra of these two shells in order to obtain line intensities which, together with our optical spectra, can be compared with time-dependent calculations we have made which describe the shell evolution. The composition and conditions derived will then provide constraints on thermonuclear runaway models of the nova outburst.|Y
CVCSS|Ultraviolet Observations of Galactic Novae|Sumner G.|Starrfield|Arizona|We propose that galactic novae brighter than about visual magnitude 8 be observed as objects of opportunity with the IUE. Ultraviolet spectrophotometry appropriately spaced in time throughout the nova's active period and decline will provide measurements of the shift of luminosity into the ultraviolet, absorption and emission line strengths, and may be sensitive to the early phases of dust formation in the ejecta. When combined with ground-based optical and infrared observations (which will be obtained as part of this project) the data can be used to model the outburst and thereby determine important physical characteristics of the nova such as the energy budget, chemical abundances of the critical CNO elements, mass ejection rates, line formation mechanisms, and dust condensation processes.|Y
CVDAH|UV Study of UX UMA and Related Objects|Albert V.|Holm|CSC|UX UMa is an eclipsing, novalike variable which has been discovered to be a spectacular ultraviolet spectrum variable. intense UV line emission which was observed in October 1980 was not present 8 months earlier, although the visual magnitude was not significantly different. Time resolved spectra showed that the line emission is much less weakened in eclipse than the continuum, indicating the line forming region to be more extended than the source of the blue continuum. Since related objects do not show strong line emission, it is likely that this is a transient phase in UX UMa. Our proposal is to follow up on this discovery by monitoring the behaviour of the line emission during the upcoming year. Also, to establish the significance of this discovery in the broader context of the cataclysmic variables, observations of related objects are required.|Y
CVDAK|A Study of Time-Dependent Disk Accretion in Dwarf Novae|A. L.|Kiplinger|Applied Research & Systems|We propose to study the physics of mass accretion in close binary systems. Observationally, concurrent IUE and ground-based spectrophotometry of a dwarf nova in eruption are to be obtained during the rise to maximum and at a representative stage of the decline (approximate wavelength coverage: 1200A to 7000A ). A method to overcome the difficult observational problem of observing a dwarf nova on the rise is fully described. The observational results are to be compared with theoretically predicted fluxes from detailed, fully time-dependent accretion disk models. One objective of this work is to discriminate among currently competing outburst models of the dwarf nova eruption. An improved understanding of accretion processes in the dwarf novae should ultimately lead to a better understanding of accretion processes in other classes of astronomical objects.|Y
CVDCW|Target of Opportunity Observations of Nova & X-Ray Nova|Chi-Chao|Wu|CSC|We propose to continue our program to observe novae, recurrent novae and X-ray novae when outburst events occur. By obtaining spectra at visual maximum, periodically during the post maximum decay, and, if possible, during the premaximum, rise, we will follow the evolution of the continuum and the line spectra. For both novae and X-ray novae low dispersion spectra will enable us to derive the interstellar absorption (from the middle UV graphite absorption feature and from ratios of line strengths) from which the distance can be estimated. The time sequence of dereddened spectra will yield information on the evolution of effective temperature, luminosity, physical conditions in the source, and abundances of elements. This time sequence will also permit dust formation in the expanding envelope to be studied. High dispersion spectra, if feasible, will be obtained for line identification and to derive the mass and expansion rate of the nova ejecta. These data will be integrated with existing data for four novae and three X-ray novae to explore differences and similarities and to distinguish between models of the outburst mechanism. We also propose to continue obtaining post-outburst spectra of Nova Cygni 1978, WZ Sge and the novalike object in Vulpeculae for comparison with the physical conditions in outburst.  Since two of the proposers are IUE Resident Astronomers, they will be able to respond rapidly to obtain observations during the critical early phases of the outburst.|Y
CVDDL|UV Spectroscopy of Symbiotic Stars, Recurrent & Old Novae|David L.|Lambert|Texas|This proposal describes a combination of a program of ultraviolet spectroscopy of the symbiotic variables, and the old and recurrent novae. Low resolution IUE spectra have been obtained which provide both the emission line spectra of the nebula as well as the continuum of the hot, underlying star. A completion of the low resolution survey is proposed.  A program of IUE observations of the symbiotic variable AG Pegasus was initiated in June 1979, and has continued through 1980. Line profile and radial velocity variations provide important clues to the distribution of hot gas within the binary. These data are being complemented by optical observations at the McDonald Observatory. Nearinfrared data yield the orbit of the cool M giant; the line profiles of [O III], H-alpha, He II, He I, and Fe II provide information on the ionized gas within the system.  The IUE low resolution spectra for other symbiotics are being combined with groundbased observations to determine the physical structure of these peculiar variables.  Old novae are being studied, using the IUE low resolution spectra to derive the structure of the accretion disk and the hot gaseous region (a corona above the disk?) responsible for the emission lines.  A series of complementary groundbased and IUE observations are proposed in the event of a recurrent nova eruption.|Y
CVDEG|Ultraviolet Studies of Nova-Like Variables|Edward F.|Guinan|Villanova|We propose to observe nine close binary systems containing accretion disks and hot white dwarfs. Seven of the systems are nova-like variables, which appear to be cataclysmic objects in continuous outburst. Our objective is to (1) understand their evolutionary status and their possible evolutionary relationship with dwarf novae, classical novae and those cataclysmic variables with extended high states (SU UMa systems) and to (2) understand why they do not suffer major outbursts. One of our proposed targets is a newly discovered Hyades close binary containing a hot white dwarf which provides a unique opportunity to (1) obtain a reliable mass-radius point for degenerate stars, and (2) attempt to understand the further evolution via systemic mass loss, of the poorly known common envelope phase of evolution. Another target contains a hot degenerate star and a G8 giant. Phase dependent observations will be made using the degenerate star radiation as a beaming probe of the red giant's atmospheric structure. Coordinated ground-based observations of several of our northern hemisphere targets are planned. The scientific merits of observing each system are discussed and our IUE experiment is outlined.|Y
CVDFC|The Dwarf Nova Outburst & X-Ray Emitting Cataclysmic Variable Stars|F.|Cordova|Lanl|In the last year we have made IUE observations of several close binary systems in conjunction with simultaneous, or complementary, x-ray and optical measurements. Our main effort has been to try to understand the dynamics of the cataclysmic variable stars, a particular subgroup of low-mass binaries that have quasi-periodic optical outbursts (on time scales from weeks to 105 years!). Here we briefly describe the specific aims of our program, summarize our findings, and show why additional observations are necessary to (a) constrain the models for the cause of the outbursts, and (b) determine the nature and interrelationship of the x-ray, UV, and optical emitting regions.|Y
CVDHB|A Search for Cataclysmic Binaries Containing Strongly Magnetic White Dwarfs|Howard E.|Bond|Louisiana State|The AM Herculis variables are cataclysmic binaries containing white dwarfs with surface magnetic fields of a few times 10^7 gauss. These systems are characterized by strong circular and linear polarization in the optical band.  Recent work on cyclotron emission from accreting magnetic white dwarfs predicts that AM Her-like binaries with fields stronger than roughly 5 x 10^7 Gauss will not show conspicuous optical polarization, and therefore have as yet gone undiscovered (Chanmugam and Dulk 1981). However, theory also predicts that such strongly magnetic binaries will be spectacular UV sources because cyclotron self-absorption will produce a Rayleigh-Jeans curve at frequencies up to about 10 times the cyclotron frequency (Lamb and Masters 1979).  Bond has underway an optical spectroscopic survey of cataclysmic variables. From this survey we have selected 10 objects that are spectroscopically similar to the AM Her binaries (primarily in having high-excitation emission-line spectra when at maximum light, in contrast to the majority of cataclysmic variables); several of these objects are also known to have long-term light variations similar to those of AM Her systems. These objects will be observed with IUE, in order to see whether any of them show the extremely strong UV continua predicted from binaries with extremely strong magnetic fields.|Y
CVDPS|Short Period Cataclysmic Variables|Paula|Szkody|Washington|IUE observations are proposed for a small subset of 9 cataclysmics called VY Scl variables (short period close binaries which spend most of their time in a high optical state and which have strong H and He emission). The presence of He II 4686 in the optical spectra and known X-ray emission for several members indicates a hot component such as a hot spot, a hot WD, or a boundary layer in a disk. The UV spectra would be used to study the T and line emission from this component. Optical spectrophotometry and IR broad band photometric observations would be joined to the UV and the total flux distribution compared to previous observations of dwarf novae in order to determine the nature of these systems and why their excitation conditions are so different.|Y
CVDSS|Ultraviolet Observations of Galactic Novae|Sumner G.|Starrfield|Arizona|We propose that galactic novae brighter than about visual magnitude 8 continue to be observed as Targets of Opportunity with the IUE. Ultraviolet spectrophotometry appropriately spaced in time throughout the nova's active period and decline will provide measurements of the shift of luminosity into the ultraviolet, absorption and emission line strengths, and may be sensitive to the early phases of dust formation in the ejecta. When combined with ground-based optical and infrared observations (which will be obtained as part of this project) the data can be used to model the outburst and thereby determine important physical characteristics of the nova such as the energy budget, chemical abundances of the critical CNO elements, mass ejection rates, line formation mechanisms, and dust condensation processes.|Y
CVECW|Target of Opportunity Observations of Nova & X-Ray Nova|Chi-Chao|Wu|CSC|We propose to continue our program to observe novae, recurrent novae and X-ray novae when outburst events occur. By obtaining spectra at visual maximum, periodically during the post maximum decay, and, if possible, during the pre-maximum rise, we will follow the evolution of the continuum and the line spectra. For both novae and X-ray novae low dispersion spectra will enable us to derive the interstellar absorption (from the middle UV graphite absorption feature and from ratios of line strengths) from which the distance can be estimated. The time sequence of dereddened spectra will yield information on the evolution of effective temperature, luminosity, physical conditions in the source, and abundances of elements. This time sequence will also permit dust formation in the expanding envelope to be studied. High dispersion spectra, if feasible, will be obtained for line identification and to derive the mass and expansion rate of the nova ejecta. These data will be integrated with existing data for five novae and three X-ray novae to explore differences and similarities and to distinguish between models of the outburst mechanism. We also propose to continue obtaining post-outburst spectra of GK Per, and the transient X-ray source A0535+26 (HDE 245770) for comparison with the spectra in outburst.  Since two of the proposers are IUE Resident Astronomers, they will be able to respond rapidly to obtain observations during the critical early phases of the outburst.|Y
CVEFC|Degenerate Stars in Eclipsing Close Binary SYS & Search for Corona|France Anne|Cordova|Los Alamos|We propose to measure the ultraviolet flux and spectral distribution of the hot, degenerate, accreting component in close binary ("cataclysmic variable") systems. To distinguish the emission of the central object from the emission of the accretion disk which surrounds it, we will study only those systems which undergo an eclipse of the degenerate star.  We also propose to search for an ultraviolet corona around the compact star and inner disk. Such a corona is expected from heating of the disk by the EUV and X-radiation from the central star. We anticipate that much of the flux from such a photoionized corona is emitted as resonance line radiation, and would be observable by monitoring the behavior of the spectral lines through eclipse.|Y
CVEHB|A Search for Cataclysmic Binaries Containing Strongly Magnetic White Dwarfs|Howard E.|Bond|Louisiana State|The AM Herculis variables are cataclysmic binaries containing white dwarfs with surface magnetic fields of a few times 10^7 gauss. These systems are characterized by strong circular and linear polarization in the optical band.  Single white dwarfs are known with fields as high as 3 x 10^8 gauss, and we would expect a few cataclysmic binaries to contain such strongly magnetic stars. However, recent work on cyclotron emission from accreting white dwarfs predicts that AM Herlike binaries with fields stronger than about 5 x 10^7 gauss will not show conspicuous optical polarization (Chanmugam and Dulk 1981), and therefore have as yet gone undetected. But the theory also predicts that such strongly magnetic binaries will be spectacular UV sources because cyclotron self-absorption will produce a Rayleigh-Jeans curve at frequencies up to about 10 times the cyclotron frequency.  Bond has underway an optical spectroscopic survey of cataclysmic variables. From this survey we have selected objects that are similar to the AM Her binaries in having highexcitation emission-line spectra when at maximum light and/or longterm light variations similar to those of AM Her systems. These objects will be observed with IUE in order to see whether any of them show the extremely strong UV continua predicted from binaries with extremely strong magnetic fields. If such objects do not exist, it would point to a major difference between single white dwarfs and those in close binaries.|Y
CVEJL|Bright, Optically Thick Accretion Disks|James W.|Liebert|Arizona|We propose to obtain ultraviolet spectrophotometry of twelve binary systems with light dominated by an optically thick accretion disk. These systems are similar to the variable CD-42 14462, a dwarf nova in a state of perpetual outburst, but with narrower absorption lines. The objects were selected from the Palomar-Green survey of blue stellar objects. Their optical spectra strongly resemble those of mediumrich subdwarf B stars, with Balmer absorption lines of moderate width, but multichannel energy distributions show them to be decidedly non-thermal with both colors and line spectra consistent with theoretical models for high accretion rate disks.  Because of their flat power law energy distributions, most of their bolometric luminosity arises from the IUE ultraviolet range. We wish to use the IUE plus multichannel energy distributions, covering 1200 to 10,000 A, in combination with our high dispersion line profiles to estimate the absolute visual magnitude of each system using theoretical models. The statistically complete nature of the sample then allows us to compute the space density of these systems and to compare their incidence to that of other cataclysmic variables.  In addition, we wish to obtain a few high signal to noise short wavelength camera spectra for accurate measurement of ultraviolet absorption line strengths and profiles. We will then interpret these data in the context of disk models by Williams to study the temperature, density, and ionization structure of the hot inner disk region.|Y
CVEJP|Ultraviolet Spectra of White Dwarf Pulsars|Joseph|Patterson|CFA|There is a class of cataclysmic variables (the "DQ Herculis stars") which show rapid, highly coherent periodicities In their optical and X-ray emission. These systems appear to be analogues of binary X-ray pulsars, in which a rapidly rotating, magnetized white dwarf replaces the customary neutron star as the accreting component. The accretion "hot spot" at the white dwarf a magnetic pole Is thought to be an intense source of pulsed ultraviolet emission, but this has never been measured, due to the, observational problems of rapid rotation and the presence of a large unpulsed emission from the accretion disk. We propose to determine the spectrum of the pulsed emission by binning the spectra In phase with the pulsations. By subtracting the "pulse-off" spectra from the "pulse-on" spectra, we may obtain the spectrum of the pulsed light. Ground-based spectroscopy shows in every case that the pulse amplitude climbs sharply toward shorter wavelengths, leaving little doubt that the real energetics of the pulse lurk somewhere in the satellite ultraviolet.|Y
CVEPS|Short Outburst Period Cataclysmic Variables|Paula|Szkody|Washington|UV spectra of a selected group of dwarf novae with short outburst periods (<30 days) and longer lasting outbursts are the main targets of this proposal. This group consists of potential SU UMa stars or an intermediate case between the normal U Gem and the SU UMa types.  Through analysis of the continuum contributions joined with optical and infrared fluxes, the disk characteristics (accretion rate, temperature and size) are determined. These characteristics will be compared throughout the outburst to test accretion theory which predicts a larger disk and increased accretion for longer outbursts. Comparison of the quiescent state disk with normal U Gem, Z Cam and SU UMa systems will be made to determine the cause of the different types of outbursts among these otherwise similar close binaries.  Further study of the mass outflow during outburst (from the P Cyg Profile of CIV) and of the superhump phenomena present in SU UMa stars will also be done.|Y
CVESS|Ultraviolet Observations of Galactic Novae|Sumner G.|Starrfield|Arizona|We propose that galactic novae brighter than about visual magnitude 8 continue to be observed as Targets of Opportunity with the IUE. Ultraviolet spectrophotometry appropriately spaced in time throughout the nova's active period and decline will provide measurements of the shift of luminosity into the ultraviolet, absorption and emission line strengths, and may be sensitive to the early phases of dust formation in the ejecta. When combined with ground-based optical and infrared observations (which will be obtained as part of this project) the data can be used to model the outburst and thereby determine important physical characteristics of the nova such as the energy budget, chemical abundances of the critical CNO elements, mass ejection rates, line formation mechanisms, and dust condensation processes.|Y
CVFAH|The 1978 Outburst of WZ Sagittae|Albert V.|Holm|CSC|We propose a comprehensive analysis of archived spectra of WZ Sagittae which were obtained during and after the 1978 December outburst. These spectra give better time and wavelength resolution of the spectral changes which occur during outburst than available for other dwarf novae because of the longer time scale of the outburst and the smaller visual magnitude. our goal is to better understand the behavior of the accretion disk during outburst. The steps to achieving this goal are: 1)to model the time-dependent energy distribution and luminosity with accretion disk models.  2)to determine the patterns of gas flow within and out of the system through the variations in the spectrum throughout the outburst. These will be compared with models of time-dependent accretion, such as that of Bath and Pringle (1981), and with other hypotheses, such as the redistribution hypothesis of Klare et al. (1982).  and 3)to determine the disk structure and the physical conditions in the material causing the "super hump". This analysis will be based on a study of the spectral and energy distribution variations with the orbital period.  These spectra have not previously been analyzed adequately because there had been no approved programs for observations of cataclysmic variables during the IUE's first observing year.|Y

CVFES|Continued Ultraviolet Studies of UX Ursa Majoris Stars|Edward M.|Sion|Villanova|We propose to obtain phase dependent observations of three UX Ursa Majoris nova-like variables in order to analyze the spectrophotometric variability around their orbit. The UX UMa systems contain-hot white dwarfs, steady state accretion disks and appear to be cataclysmic in "continuous outburst". One of our proposed targets, a newly discovered UX UMa star, is the brightest known cataclysmic variable. A second target, V3855 Sgr, has a hot high velocity wind apparently escaping the system and a third target appears to have a stable steady state, thick, disk but no outflowing wind which would imply a different origin for the UV absorption lines than in most of the other UX Uma systems. we review the present status of research on UX UMa stars, outline our IUE experiment and discuss the scientific merits of observing each proposed system.|Y
CVFJN|Newly Discovered AM Her Systems: E2003+223 and E1045-451|John A.|Nousek|Pennsylvania State University|Two new AM Her-type cataclysmic variable systems have been discovered on the basis of their bright soft X-ray spectrum. I have observed one, E1405-451, with single IUE exposures covering an entire orbital period (101.5^m). The UV spectrum greatly resembled AM Her, peppered with strong emission lines on a continuum rising at short wavelength. One intriguing difference from AM Her was the limit of a P Cygni profile for the CIV and HeII lines which may indicate a magnetically confined, radiatively driven wind (Nousek and Pravdo 1982).  I propose a series of short, 30-60^m, exposures in order to phase resolve the UV emission from these short period systems. In addition I propose one long, ~5 hr, short wavelength exposure to confirm or reject the P Cygni nature of the lines in E1405-451.  The observations are important because the magnetic fields in these systems make the emission geometry highly anisotropic. Thus the angle of inclination of the system makes a great difference in the spectrum. By extending phase resolved spectroscopy to new members of the small class of AM Her stars we can give a three dimensional insight into these exciting systems.|Y
CVFJP|Accretion Disk Parameters in Cataclysmic Variables|Joseph|Patterson|CFA|We propose to measure the fundamental parameters of the accretion disks (accretion rate, white dwarf mass, and inner and outer disk radii) in all cataclysmic variables of known orbital period. This will be accomplished by fitting the observed continuum flux distribution in the interval 1200 - 9000 A to theoretical disk models, and applying five additional constraints known from other observations: the absolute visual magnitude, the equivalent width of the Balmer lines, the white dwarf mass, the orbital period, and the ratio of X-ray to visual luminosity. The IUE archives can provide most of the needed ultraviolet data, but in addition we request new observations of systems with optically thin disks. These are the most common type of cataclysmic variable, but have been almost completely ignored by IUE observers because they are faint and possess rather cool disks. We expect to determine the disk parameters in ~50 systems altogether. Such a large data base enables two secondary projects which we would like to carry out: (1) the dependence of mass transfer rate on radius In quiescent dwarf novae; and (2) the dependence of UV emission-line fluxes on the disk parameters. Both can be accomplished as a byproduct of our main line of analysis, and both can be compared to the predictions of several current models of the accretion process.|Y
CVFJR|Development of P Cygni Profiles in Dwarf Nova Outburst|John C.|Raymond|CFA|P Cygni profiles indicate strong, high velocity mass loss from several dwarf novas during outburst. These P Cygni profiles give direct estimates of the mass loss rates and Indirect Indications of the emission at unobservable wavelengths In the EUV. Thus the development of P Cygni profiles during outburst reflects the development of the Inner disk regions which cannot be studied at optical wavelengths. The Ideal candidate for these observations Is IE0643.0-1648, since It shows strong P Cygni profiles, It has frequent outbursts, and It Is relatively bright.|Y
CVFPA|Ulteaviolet Observations of Newly Discovered AM Herculis-Like X-Ray Binary H0139-68|Prahlad C.|Agrawal|Tata Ins|We propose to study the ultraviolet continuum and resonant emission lines in the 1200-3200 A band from a newly discovered AM Herculis like X-ray emitting binary H0139-68 discovered by us (Agrawal et al, 1981). The optical and X-ray characteristics suggest that H0139-68 contain a magnetic white dwarf and the observed soft X-ray flux originates in the accretion column above the magnetic poles of the star. The soft X-ray spectrum is best described as black body emission with kT 40 ev (Agrawal et al, 1982). The proposed observations with IUE are aimed at the study of (I) Ultraviolet continuum to determine whether this is Rayleigh-Jeans end of the same black body which produces the soft X-ray flux; (II) To search for any strong UV flux due to cyclotron emission predicted in the model of Lamb & Master (1979); (III) Study variability.|Y
CVFPS|Extended Outburst/High Excitation Cataclysmic Variables|Paula|Szkody|Washington|Further UV spectra of a number of cataclysmic variables exhibiting strong HeII4686 and/or extended outbursts are needed to complete a data base encompassing 30 objects of this type (VY SO and SU UMa relatives).  The data will be joined with optical and infrared fluxes in order to obtain large wavelength continuum distributions that will be compared to disk models to determine accretion rates, temperature ranges and sizes. These characteristics will be compared throughout outburst and orbit situations and with existing data on normal dwarf novae (U Gem and Z Cam stars) to determine the cause of the extended outburst and high state situation and the location of the line emission areas. Further study of the mass outflow during outburst (using the P Cyg profile of CIV) will be used to test available mass loss models.|Y
CVFRP|Outburst Rise of Dwarf Novae|Robert J.|Panek|CSC|Our investigation is directed toward the two outstanding questions in the study of the dwarf novae: 'Is it the mass-losing star or is it the accretion disk itself which instigates the cyclic outburst behavior of the dwarf novae?' and 'What is the nature of the viscosity which powers the luminous accretion disks?'. We will observe the very brief rise to maximum light at the start of the outburst of a few dwarf novae. Given the broad spectral coverage of the IUE, the flux distribution during this rise determines the synchronization of the start of the outburst over the surface of the disk, since the inner regions are hotter (hence bluer) than the outer regions. If as we expect, the outburst in the UV lags the optical outburst, the cool outer regions must have brightened first. This would rule out a global instability of the disk, in which the viscosity suddenly increased everywhere. The evolution of the flux distribution during the outburst rise allows to estimate the rate at which the outburst is communicated throughout the entire disk. This permits, through modeling, the determination of the magnitude of the viscosity in the disk, which is presently unknown. Because the outburst rise is very brief (less than 24 hrs) and because the time of the outburst is not predictable, the outburst rise has not been studied to date. However, with the cooperation of the AAVSO network of visual observers throughout the United States, and with an observing 'season' which permits chances at more than one outburst and in more than one object, the probability that target of opportunity scheduling will meet our needs is excellent.|Y

We also propose to continue obtaining post-outburst spectra of GK Per for comparison with the spectra in outburst and to investigate the possible evolution of the accretion disk between outbursts. Since all three proposers reside near Goddard Space Flight Center, we will be able to respond rapidly to obtain observations during the critical early phases of the outburst.|Y
CVGFC|IUE Observations of High-Inclination Close Binary Systems|France Anne|Cordova|Lanl|We propose to observe close binary systems whose accretion disks are viewed nearly edge-on in order to resolve several outstanding problem concerning the continuum flux distribution of these stars and the origin and nature of their spectral lines. Specific problems that will be addressed are: the origin of the UV emission lines; the conditions under which an outflowing wind is observed; the brightness distribution of the accretion disk; the shape of the hard X-ray spectrum; and the reality of a third periodicity in the continuum flux of a double-period, eclipsing, close binary in which magnetic fields are thought to be important.|Y
CVGJR|P Cygni Profile Variations in Dwarf Novae|John C.|Raymond|CFA|P Cygni profiles indicate strong, high velocity maw loss from several dwarf novae during outburst. These P Cygni profiles give direct estimates of the maw loss rates and indirect indications of the emission at unobservable wavelengths in the EUV. We have observed substantial variations in the width and shape of the C IV profile in HL CMa while the optical brightness changed by -0.5 rnagnitude. We wish to extend this study to the full amplitude of HL CMa and to study another dwarf nova which has similar optical variations. We hope to test the theory we have developed for boundary layer emission and to determine the size of the region where the wind originates.|Y
CVGRP|IUE and Voyager Observations of SS Cygni in Outburst|Ronald S.|Polidan|USC|We propose to obtain simultaneous IUE (1200 - 3000 A) and Voyager (912 - 1200 A) observations of SS Cygni through two outbursts. The combined IUE and Voyager data (along with proposed simultaneous ground based and X-ray observations) would provide the most complete spectral coverage to date of a dwarf nova in outburst. Observing two outbursts (one long duration and one short duration) is proposed because of theoretical suggestions that they may differ in the UV and very tentative Voyager results that imply that the short outbursts are deficient in far-UV flux.  The data from the two spacecraft will be combined to form flux distribution sequences and used to explore the evolution of the disk from the initial stages of the outburst, through maximum, to quiescence. Existing models for accretion disks will be used in the analysis. Particular attention will be paid to the inner accretion disk/boundary layer region that provides most of the far-UV flux.|Y
CVGSS|Ultraviolet Observations of Galactic Novae in Outburst|Sumner G.|Starrfield|Arizona|We propose that galactic novae brighter than about visual magnitude 8 continue to be observed as Targets of Opportunity with the IUE. Ultraviolet spectrophotometry appropriately spaced in time throughout the nova's active period and decline will provide measurements of the shift of luminosity into the ultraviolet, absorption and emission line strengths, and may be sensitive to the early phases of dust formation in the ejecta. When combined with ground-based optical and infrared observations (which will be obtained as part of this project) the data can be used to model the outburst and thereby determine important physical characteristics of the nova such as the energy budget, chemical abundances of the critical CNO elements, mass ejection rates, line formation mechanisms, and dust condensation processes.|Y
CVGWB|Accretion Disk Parameters in Cataclysmic Variables|William P.|Blair|CFA|We wish to extend a program begun in Round 6 to study the accretion disk parameters in cataclysmic variables (CVs) with low maw transfer rates. Them are the most common type of CV, but they have been largely ignored by previous IUE observers because they are faint and possess rather cool disks. However, the continuum shapes in these systems are more sensitive to parameters such as the white dwarf maw and Inner and outer disk radii than are the high M systems studied previously. The observed continuum fluxes In the 1200-9000A region will be analyzed by fitting theoretical accretion disks and by applying observational constraints from other wavelength regions|Y
CVHDG|Analysis of High Resolution Spectra of Slow Nova RR TEL|Daya P.|Gilra|S M Systems|Weak continuum, low reddening, and an exceptionally rich emission line spectrum (covering several stages of ionization), which evolves very slowly, have made the slow nova RR Tel (1950: alpha = 20h00m, delta = 55 52') a unique spectroscopic phenomenon. Thackeray (1977) discussed the ground based and Penston et al. (1983) have discussed the very early IUE spectra. Spectra show considerable resemblance to the spectra of QSO's and nuclei of Seyfert galaxies. It is proposed to use the recent archival high resolution data (1982-84). If no spectral variations are found then the spectra will be co-added for detecting weak lines. We shall analyse the spectroscopic processes - new emission lines, fluorescence, charge transfer, recombination, and dielectronic recombination. A model of this object will be made. Knowledge from the analysis will be used towards a better understanding of other interacting binaries and QSO's and nuclei of Seyfert galaxies. As a check some high resolution spectra of a similar symbiotic star V 1016 Cygni (1950:alpha = 19h55, delta +39 41) will also be analysed.|Y
CVHES|IUE Spectroscopy of Pre-Cataclysmic Binaries|Edward M.|Sion|Villanova|We propose to observe at least two short period, detached, postcommon envelope binaries, each consisting of an m dwarf and white dwarf. Temperatures and gravities of the white dwarfs will be directly determined from a model atmosphere analysis of the ultraviolet energy distribution and of the Ly-alpha < red wing. it is possible that both white dwarfs are considerably cooler than the previously studied star, Case 1, and thus would further constrain the characteristic time scale for angular momentum removal mechanisms during the post-common envelope phase, needed to trigger mass transfer from the secondary.|Y
CVHFC|High Dispersion SWP Studies of Winds in Cataclysmic Variable Stars|France Anne|Cordova|LANL|We propose to take high dispersion spectra of several cataclysmic variable stars (CVs) to obtain detailed line profiles of the winds in these systems. Our aim is to understand the formation and geometry of the winds, which are observed only in the most luminous CVs: the novalike stars and dwarf novae in outburst. The long-range goal is to determine the mass loss rate in these systems and the effect this has on the evolution of the binary. We have selected as possible targets four novalike stars and four dwarf novae because of their feasibility for high dispersion studies.|Y
CVHGS|Time-Resolved Spectroscopy of Superhumps in the Light Curves of Eclipsing Su Uma Systems|George|Sonneborn|CSC|Recent analysis of the only known eclipsing SU UMa systems, Z Cha and OY Car, indicate that the superhump light is not eclipsed. The most obvious interpretation is that the superhumps are spots (at a temperature of about 15000K, compared to about 4000K for the surrounding photosphere) on the nonsynchronously rotating red component. If this hypothesis is correct, a study of the spectrum of the spot should be possible by using IUE. We propose to observe OY Car during superoutburst when the red component eclipses the accretion disk and the spot is at a maximum. Since superoutburst occurs at long intervals about 300 days) and is non-periodic, the proposed study requires Target of Opportunity scheduling. This program is feasible because OY Car is observable by IUE for 12 months of the year. Similar programs are currently in force for X-ray and optical coverage of OY Car with the EXOSAT satellite and the AAT, respectively.|Y
CVHJE|International Search Program of Dwarf Novae During the First Day of Outburst|Juan|Echevarria|Mexico|An international search program to detect dwarf novae during the first day of outburst is being launched for early 1986, and will include Xrays, ultraviolet, optical and infrared observations. IUE coordinated NASA and ESA-SERC shifts are sought for a total of 48 contiguous hours. We argue in the proposal that a well established ground-based photometric program will ensure detection of at least one dwarf novae during the early stage of outburst.  The IUE observations will provide essential clues to the understanding of the physical processes that produce the outburst. SWP and LWP exposure will be combined with low and high resolution spectroscopy and visual and infrared observations. EXOSAT facilities will also be sought as most of the observed flux is emitted in the X-rays.  Targets will be selected by a coordinating panel at a telecommunications centre at the Royal Greenwich Observatory during the observing runs. Priority will be given to those systems with short outburst recurrence.|Y
CVHJR|Mass Loss from Cataclysmic Variables|John C.|Raymond|CFA|P Cygni profiles observed in the spectra of many dwarf novae during outburst, as well as in spectra of nova-like variables and old novae, show substantial mass loss rates and velocities as high as 5000 km/s. A Seventh Year study of the mass loss from HL CMa is in progress, and we have constructed theoretical models of the ionization state of the wind and of the resulting absorption profiles. Work on the P Cygni emission profiles is in progress. We wish to extend this work to other cataclysmic variables, particularly those having mass transfer rates different from that of BL CMa.|Y
CVHPS|A Study of the Accretion Characteristics of Six Unique Cataclysmic Variables|Paula|Szkody|Washington|Long and short wavelength, low dispersion spectra for 6 unique cataclysmic variables are proposed. The data will be used with optical coverage for study of the heating effects associated with column and disk accretion in these dwarf novae and novalike systems. Single long exposures will-be obtained for 4 systems as well as -, 30 min exposures throughout several orbits of 2 short period systems(P<2 hr). These exposures will be analysed for 3. aspects of accretion phenomena; a) the presence of a RayleighJeans tail in the short wavelength UV of BV Pup and SVS8130 (which have unusually strong He 114686) indicative of EUV/soft X-ray heating of the white dwarf from an accretion column shock; b) the temperature and luminosity of reprocessed radiation from the secondary or stream which is indicated from the phasing and color of optical data on IR Gem and SW UMa; and c) the mass accretion rate and disk luminosity for the 2 high inclination systems CW Mon and PG 1030. Several existing spectra on other systems showing steep UV flux distributions and strong HeII4686 will also be analysed as part of the study of white dwarf heating.|Y
CVHRP|Simultaneous IUE and Voyager Observations of the Dwarf Nova Z Camelopardalis|Ronald S.|Polidan|Arizona|We propose to obtain simultaneous IUE low resolution SWP and LWP (1150 - 3200 A) and Voyager (500 - 1200 A) observations of the dwarf nova Z Cam through one complete outburst. The combined IUE and Voyager data (along with proposed simultaneous ground based and X-ray observations) would provide the most comprehensive coverage of this class: of dwarf nova to date.  The data from the two spacecraft will be used to form composite 500 - 3200 A flux distribution sequences to explore the evolution of the disk from the initial stages of the outburst, through maximum, to quiescence. Particular attention will be paid to the shape of the UV flux distribution and to the changes in the principal wind lines of N V, Si IV, and C IV. Existing models for accretion disks will be used in the analysis. A comparison will also be made with similar, (existing) data on the U Gem system, SS Cyg, and the SU UMa star VW Hyi.|Y
CVHRW|The White Dwarfs and Inner Accretion Disc of 3 Unusual Dwarf Novae|Richard A.|Wade|Arizona|We have selected 3 dwarf novae for which UV observations are especially important. We can use IUE observations combined with optical and infrared results already available to study (1) the white dwarf primary stars and (2) the inner parts of the surrounding accretion discs (temperature ranges, optical depths, formation of emission lines). These items address issues of current interest with regard to the long-term evolution of close binaries and the short timescale (i.e. outburst) behavior of the accretion discs themselves. The IUE observations are also essential to resolve particular ambiguities in our present understanding of these key systems.|Y
CVHSS|Ultraviolet Observations of Nova Vulpeculae 1984 and Other Novae in Outburst|Sumner G.|Starrfield|Arizona|We propose that the galactic slow nova which is currently (October 1984) about visual magnitude 9 continue to be observed with the IUE. Ultraviolet spectrophotometry appropriately spaced in time (about 1 observation per month) throughout the nova's active period and decline will provide measurements of the shift of luminosity into the ultraviolet, absorption and emission line strengths, and may be sensitive to the phenomena which cause the turn-off of the outburst. When combined with ground-based optical and infrared observations (which are being obtained as part of this project) the data can be used to model the outburst and thereby determine important physical characteristics of the nova such as the energy budget, chemical abundances of the critical CNO elements, mass ejection rates, line formation mechanisms, and dust condensation processes. We also propose Target of Opportunity Data be obtained on any other Bright Nova during the year.|Y
CVHTK|Measurements of Wind Features From Cataclysmic Variables|Timothy R.|Kallman|NASA/GSFC|We propose to study P-Cygni line features in the spectra from Cataclysmic Variable (CV) stars. These features are indicators of mass outflow from CV's in the form of a stellar wind. Estimates of wind mass loss rate for one system, TW Vir, indicate that such winds can be dynamically important, and that they can affect the spectrum in the soft X-ray energy band. This project would use archival IUE images of CV's to determine absorption optical depths and widths for the resonance lines of C IV (1549 A), Si IV (1398 A), and N V (1240 A). These data would then be compared with the data for TW Vir and with photoionization models in order to explore the range of CV wind properties and to test for correlations between wind mass loss rate and other observable parameters, including soft x-ray flux, visual magnitude, and inclination angle.|Y
CVIFC|The Nature of Accretion Disk Winds|France Anne|Cordova|Lanl|Our aim is to examine the origin of the variability of the line profiles in luminous cataclysmic variables with high-velocity winds. We have observed that all aspects of the line profiles are variable. the relative strengths of the broad emission and absorption parts of the P Cygni-like profiles change on timescales short compared to an orbital cycle, and narrow, emission-like features within the absorption part of the broad profile change wavelength position (i.e. velocity) on a similarly short timescale. Our proposal is to monitor the line spectrum as a function of binary orbital phase and the system's ultraviolet luminosity.  The first part of our proposal is to take consecutive. high dispersion, SWP spectra of the bright novalike star CPD-4801577 covering 3 US1 shifts. We will thus obtain detailed line profiles. including resolution of the narrow features, of this cataclysmic variable (CV) over a few of its 4.5 hr binary orbital cvcles.  In addition, we would studv the effect of both the binary orbit and changes in luminosity on the broad P Cygni profiles by monitoring a dwarf nova over a few orbital cycles during the decline of such a star from an outburst. For this we request 3 US-2 shifts spread over a week's time. Our long-range goals are to understand the formation and geometry of CV disk winds, and determine the mass loss rate in these systems and the effect this has on the evolution of the binary.|Y
CVIGS|Superoutburst Development in Eclipsing Su Uma Systems|George|Sonneborn|CSC|Analysis of recent IUE observations of OY Car, obtained by our eighthepisode Target of Opportunity program during the May 1985 superoutburst, reveal that the superhump UV continuum is totally eclipsed, the presence of a strong, high-temperature emission line spectrum, and that the emission lines are partially eclipsed. Our simultaneous EXOSAT coverage detected no X-ray eclipse, implying that the UV emitting region is less extended than the X-ray region.  OY Car and Z Cha are the only known eclipsing SU UMa systems. In these systems the superhump period is 3 to 7% longer than the orbital period (about 91 minutes for OY Car). Since the May 1985 observations were made when the superhump in the light curve coincided with the eclipse, it is not clear whether the line and continuum modulation is occuring on the orbital or superhump phase.  We propose to extend out eighth-episode Target of Opportunity program to obtain new observations of the eclipsing SU UMa systems during superoutburst. We wish to determine how the line and continuum emission vary with orbital phase at times when the superhump maximum is well outside of the eclipse (phase 0.2 to 0.8). These observations would enable us to use the orbital and superhump modulations to probe the structure of the line and continuum emitting regions. This program is made feasible in part because OY Car is observable by IUE for 12 months of the year.|Y
CVIJP|Pseudo White Dwarfs in Cataclysmic Variables|Joseph|Patterson|Columbia|Using both old and. new images, we propose to study the hot white dwarf components seen in the ultraviolet spectra of many, and perhaps all, cataclysmic variables with a very low accretion rate. By determining the luminosity and effective temperature of these components, it should be possible to determine what fraction of the white dwarf's surface area is responsible for the emission. This should discriminate between the predictions, which differ by a factor of ~10, of the twomost likely theories. Effective temperature is best measured by the Lyman-alpha and/or He II 1640 absorption features, or by the continuum flux distribution.|Y
CVIJR|Line Emission in Quiescent Dwarf Novae|John C.|Raymond|CFA|The emission lines of C IV, Si IV, N V and He II are prominent in the UV spectra of many quiescent dwarf novae, but so far there has been no real analysis of these lines. We propose to compare the fluxes of these emission lines with observed X-ray fluxes and to construct models of the surfaces of accretion disks illuminated by hard and soft X-rays from the boundary layer and by the white dwarf itself, which is now known to be hot in many cases. The goal of this work is to infer the luminosity and if possible spectral distribution of radiation in the unobservable EUV range, since in some cases this dominates the total luminosity. Secondary results include description of the physical conditions in the X-ray heated surface of the disk and derivation of elemental abundances.|Y
CVIKH|Accretion Disks and White Dwarfs in Eclipsing Dwarf Novae|Keith|Horne|STScI|Eclipsing dwarf novae give fundamental information about white dwarfs, accretion disks, low-mass stars and close-binary evolution. With IUE spectra of HT Cas and IP Peg to complement our multi-color optical eclipse photometry, we will measure distance and reddening, radius and surface temperature of the white dwarfs, and the radial structure of the accretion disk, with implications for accretion disk viscosity, outburst mechanisms and close binary evolution. We conducted similar analyses of Z Cha and OY Car using IUE data obtained in the eighth year; this proposal for IUE spectra of HT Cas and IP Peg will complete the project.|Y
CVIPS|A Study of the Cataclysmic Variables V426 Oph and Ip Peg|Paula|Szkody|Washington|Time resolved low dispersion IUE spectra will be obtained throughout the orbits of the two cataclysmic variables V426 Oph and IP Peg. During the past year, x-ray observations of the 6 hr orbital period binary V426 Oph have revealed a one-hour modulation which is probably due to the rotation of the white dwarf. The long rotation and orbital periods and the brightness of this object (V=11-13 mag) make this the best system among the DQ Her type cataclysmic variables for time resolution of the rotation beam in the UV. The data will be used to study the energetics of the reprocessing and the structure of the inner disk ring. IP Peg has recently been found to be an eclipsing dwarf nova. IUE time resolved observations of the eclipse and spot will be used to study the dimensions of the line emitting region, the hot spot and white dwarf temperatures and the mass accretion rate at the inner disk.|Y

CVJGS|Ultraviolet Spectroscopy of Dwarf Novae in Outburst|George|Sonneborn|CSC|Limited IUE Observations of the eclipsing dwarf nova Z Cha well into one of its prolonged superoutbursts show that the flux distribution differs substantially from that during decline from an ordinary outburst. This should be contrasted with the non-eclipsing system VW Hyi, where it has been shown that the superoutburst flux distribution is indistinguishable from that during a normal outburst. If these differences are due to geometrical effects that come into play at high inclinations, then there are severe consequences for the structure of the disc during superoutburst.  We expect to get complete coverage of a superoutburst of Z Cha in Jan-Mar 1987 with the time allocated for our ninth-episode program. The intent of the present proposal is to obtain complete coverage of an ordinary outburst of the two eclipsing SU UMa systems, Z Cha and OY Car, in order to draw a full comparison between normal and superoutburst in both high- and low-inclination systems. Owing to the unpredictability of the outbursts, Target of Opportunity status is required for scheduling. We request two-year status for this program due to rarity of the outbursts (every 80-100 days), short duration (3 days) and the likelihood of weather preventing the discovery of a given outburst at its earliest stages.|Y
CVJJP|Pseudo White Dwarfs in Cataclysmic Variables|Joseph|Patterson|Columbia|We propose to study the hot white dwarf components seen in the ultraviolet spectra of many, and perhaps all, cataclysmic variables with a very low accretion rate. By determining the luminosity and effective temperature of these components, it should be possible to determine what fraction of the white dwarf's surface area is responsible for the emission. This should discriminate between the predictions, which differ by a factor of ~10, of the two most likely theories. We have selected seven particularly appropriate stars for new spectra, and will combine these with archival spectra presently being studied.|Y
CVJPS|UV Cooling in Long Outburst Period Dwarf Novae|Paula|Szkody|Washington|Two sets of UN' observations of 3 dwarf novae with outburst recurrence times of 2-23 yrs will be used to establish a long term limit to the cooling timescale of white dwarfs/inner disks after accretion episodes. Past work on U Gem has shown that the UN' continues to cool for 100 days after the outburst, even though the optical magnitude remains constant. Observations during the tenth year, combined with existing spectra, will extend the cooling observations to 2 yrs from last outburst (for EY Cyg and T Leo) and to 9.5 yrs (for WZ Sge). These timescales will place critical constraints on the envelope mass that undergoes accretion heating in quasi-static white dwarf models that are used in cyclic nova theory, as well as relate how the cooling is affected by inclination, orbital period and type of outburst.|Y
CVJSS|Target of Opportunity Observations of Novae in Outburst|Sumner G.|Starrfield|Arizona|We propose that galactic novae brighter than about visual magnitude 7 continue to be observed as Targets of Opportunity with the IUE satellite. Ultraviolet spectrophotometry appropriately spaced in time through the nova's active period and decline will provide measurements of the shift of luminosity into the ultraviolet, absorption and emission line strengths, and may be sensitive to the early phases of dust formation in the ejecta. When combined with ground based optical and infrared observations (to be obtained as part of this project) the data can be used to model the outburst and, thereby, determine important physical characteristics of the nova such as the energy budget, chemical abundances of the critical CNONeMg elements, mass ejection rates, line formation mechanisms, and dust condensation processes. If we are fortunate to have a very bright nova outburst during the 10th year, then it will be possible to follow it to minimum and determine what causes a nova to end its active phase.|Y
CVKCM|The P Cygni Profiles of Z Cam at Standstill|Christopher W.|Mauche|Lanl|Existing IUE spectra of the dwarf nova Z Cam sampling three separate standstills suggest that late in standstill the wind of this cataclysmic variable either switches off or undergoes a fundamental change in its ionization state. To decide between these alternatives and to study the long-term evolution of this cataclysmic variable's P Cygni profiles and ultraviolet flux distribution, we propose to obtain additional short- and long-wavelength IUE spectra of Z Cam throughout a single standstill. Given the great length of the standstills of this cataclysmic variable, this program will optimally require the acquisition of spectra over a -, 240 day interval in 8 half US2 shifts separated by ~ 30 day intervals. Given that 3 SWP spectra and 1-2 LWP spectra can be obtained of this object during a given half shift, this observing program will generate 32-40 spectra of this cataclysmic variable. By means of a photoionization code and a code which computes the shapes of P Cygni profiles for a given mass-loss rate and ionization structure, the evolution of both the absolute ultraviolet flux distribution and the shapes and strengths of the C IV, Si IV, and N V P Cygni profiles will be used to determine the mass-loss rate and ionization structure of the wind of this cataclysmic variable throughout standstill. In addition, this study will have important bearing on the question of the mechanism for mass loss (e.g. radiative acceleration vs. mechanical acceleration) in cataclysmic variables in general.|Y

CVKPS|Long Term Heating/Cooling of White Dwarfs/Disk in Cvs|Paula|Szkody|Washington|UV observations of 3 dwarf novae with outburst recurrence times of 2-23 years and one nova turned AM Her star (VI500 Cyg) will be used to establish a long term limit to the cooling timescales of white dwarf and inner disks. Past work on the dwarf nova U Gem has shown that the UV continues to cool for 100 days after the outburst. even though the optical magnitude remains constant. WZ Sge continues to show a UV decrease 8.5 years after outburst. Observations during the Ilth year of IUE. combined with existing spectra. will extend the Cooling observations to 3 years from Iasi outburst (for EY Cyg). to 10 Years (for WZ Safe) and to 13 years (for V1500 Cyg). These timescales will place critical constraints on the envelope mass that undergoes accretion heating in quasi-static white dwarf models that are used in cyclic nova theory, as well as relate how the cooling is affected by orbital period. type of outburst and magnetic field of the white dwarf. In addition, observations of the long term disk cooling in EX Hya after outburst will be used to study the disk interoutburst flux increase or decrease as relates to the conflicting. predictions of the disk instability vs secondary mass transfer theories of outburst.|Y

If we are fortunate to have a very bright nova outburst during the II th year, then it will be possible to follow it to minimum and determine what causes a nova to end its active phase. This is a companion proposal to one in which we request time to continue observations of Nova Vul 1984 #2 and Nova Vul 1987. |Y
CVLAH|Searching for the White Dwarf in Dwarf Novae|Albert V.|Holm|CSC|Low resolution spectra will be obtained of dwarf novae in quiescent phase to search for the spectral charactistics of the white dwarf primaries believed to be present in these systems. Analysis of the characteristics of the white dwarf will be used to determine the distance and luminosity of the dwarf nova, to better understand the quiescent spectra, and to provide evidence for the mechanism causing variations in the stellar surface temperature following outburst. The IUE spectra will be taken through the small aperture to avoid contamination by geocoronal Lyman-alpha so that the photospheric Lyman-alpha line can be detected and used to determine the effective temperature of the white dwarf.|Y
CVLCM|The P Cygni Profiles of Z Cam at Standstill|Christopher W.|Mauche|Los Alamos|Existing IUE spectra of the dwarf nova Z Cam sampling three separate standstills suggest that late in standstill the wind of this cataclysmic variable either switches off or undergoes a fundamental change in its ionization state. To decide between these alternatives and to study the long-term evolution of this cataclysmic variable's P Cygni profiles and ultraviolet flux distribution, we propose to obtain additional short- and long-wavelength IUE spectra of Z Cam throughout a jingle standstill. Given the great length of the standstills of this cataclysmic variable, this program will optimally require the acquisition of spectra over a approximately 240 day interval in 8 half US2 shifts separated by approximately 30 day intervals. Given that 3 SWP spectra and 12 LWP spectra can be obtained of this object during a given half shift, this observing program will generate 32-40 spectra of this cataclysmic variable. By means of a photoionization code and a code which computes the shapes of P Cygni profiles for a given mass-loss rate and ionization structure, the evolution of both the absolute ultraviolet flux distribution and the shapes and strengths of the C IV, Si IV, and N V P Cygni profiles will be used to determine the massloss rate and ionization structure of the wind of this cataclysmic variable throughout standstill. In addition, this study will have important bearing on the question of the mechanism for mass loss (e.g. radiative acceleration vs. mechanical acceleration) in cataclysmic variables in general.  This proposal is nearly identical to one submitted to and accepted by the IUE Guest Observer Program for the 11th year of observations with IUE ("The P Cygni Profiles of Z Cam at Standstill," Mauche, Szkody, and Cordova, program ID CVKCM). As of December 1988, Z Cam has not gone into standstill, the program CVKCM has not gone into effect, and no funds have been released to the investigators by the Guest Observer Program. We ask that the present proposal for target of opportunity observations of Z Cam in standstill be accepted to cover the likely possibility that the proposed 240 day observing program, if begun in late 1988 or early 1989, will significantly extend into the 12th year of observations with IUE.|Y
CVLJR|The Temperature Structure of V1082 Sagittarii|John C.|Raymond|CFA|An intermediate polar (DQ Her star) is a cataclysmic variable in which the magnetic field of the rotating white dwarf disrupts the inner part of the accretion disk. These objects are important for understanding close binary evolution and white dwarf magnetic fields. They also present an opportunity for testing theoretical ideas about the interaction of magnetic fields with plasmas. Recent IUE observations of GK Per have shown a drastic modification of the disk temperature structure by the magnetic field, consistent with that predicted by one theoretical model. Archival spectra of several other systems do not show this effect. We request time for SWP and LWP exposures of the recently discovered system V1082 Sagitarii to determine the radial temperature structure of its disk.|Y
CVLPS|The Hot Component in 3 New Cvs|Paula|Szkody|Washington|We will use IUE time-resolved spectra to pursue the white dwarf/hot component in 3 cataclysmic variables whose unique characteristics were only discovered in the last few months. UU Aqr and PG0134+070 are eclipsing systems with relatively long periods (4-5 hrs). The time-resolved IUE data will identify the white dwarf/inner disk temperature and help to resolve whether high inclination CVs have characteristically lower observed temperatures than others above the period gap. S193 is a peculiar bright new DQ Her-type system in which large amplitude optical pulsations do not appear to maintain extended coherence. Simultaneous IUE and groundbased data will be used to obtain the flux distribution and the amplitude of the UV pulse in order to determine the extent of the disk and the temperature of the pulsed component.|Y
CVLSS|Ultraviolet Observations of Nova Qu Vul 1984 ,2, Nova Gq Mus 1983 and Novae LMC 1988 , 1 & 2|Sumner G.|Starrfield|Arizona State University|We propose to continue our observations of the four novae that are currently in outburst and still bright enough to study with the IUE Satellite. The US Nova team has obtained UV, optical, and IR data on Nova QU Vul 1984 #2 since December 1984 and UV and optical data on LMC Nova 1988 #1 since March 1988. The European Nova team has been observing GQ Mus since March 1983. QU Vul 1984 is a slow nova that is currently (November 1988) about V = 14.5. GQ Mus is a fast nova (t3 ~ 40 days) that has been observed to form coronal lines with great strength (Fe X > H-alpha). No other novae have been studied in the UV for as long as these novae (GQ Mus and QU Vul) and they are providing unique data on the turn-off time scale for a nova. LMC Nova 1988 #1 (currently V = 14: FES) was observed by means of our Target of Opportunity proposal in the 10th Episode and is the first extragalactic nova studied in the UV. LMC 1988 #2 is a fast nova and has been observed since October 1988. These two novae are the first extragalactic novae to be studied in the ultraviolet and we are obtaining a unique set of data on the UV evolution of a nova. Since the outburst properties of LMC #2 differ from LMC #1, and they are both extragalactic, we are requesting observations of both novae.  QU Vul 1984 is a nova whose ejecta are overabundant in oxygen, neon, and magnesium thus placing it in the class of objects whose outburst occurs on an ONeMg white dwarf as opposed to those outbursts that occur on a CO white dwarf. However, it provides a strong test of the thermonuclear runaway theory since it is a slow nova and the predictions of the theory are that all such outbursts should evolve very rapidly.  If we can continue to observe these novae through the remaining stages of their outburst, we will be able to determine how they return to quiescence, the mass and luminosity of the hot remnant, and possibly the time-scale for reestablishment of the accretion disk. When combined with contemporaneous ground based optical and infrared observations (which are currently being obtained as part of this project), the data will be used to continue modeling the outburst and thereby determine important physical characteristics of the nova such as the energy budget, chemical abundances of the critical CNONeMg elements, and mass ejection. Finally, continuing UV spectroscopy of these novae provide data that allows us to constrain and improve the previously determined abundances of the intermediate mass elements.|Y
CVLTM|Evolution of the Wind in the Dwarf Nova IP Peg During Outburst|Thomas R.|Marsh|STScI|We will take phase resolved IUE spectra of the eclipsing dwarf nova IP Peg covering 7 days of an outburst. We will use this data to study the nature and evolution of the wind and the inner accretion disc.  Observations with IUE have shown that dwarf novae in outburst and novalike systems show evidence for mass loss via a wind. Models of the emission lines indicate that the mass loss rate is close to the theoretical maximum More recently, some observations show a fundamental conflict with the aidsymmetric wind models. In order to progress we need to know more about the wind, in particular which part of the system it comes from and how it behaves with changing accretion rate onto the white dwarf.  We will follow the dwarf nova IP Peg during the course of the outburst. This system is uniquely suited to this study since it is bright during outburst, undergoes deep eclipses and has twice as long an orbital period as any comparable system. These properties will give us 2.5 times the phase resolution of the only similar study and more precise diagnostics since the red star matches the size of the emission region better. IP Peg has the further advantage of having a faint white dwarf, which will allow us to measure the flux from the inner accretion disc more accurately than has been possible to date.  Our aims are to study the location and evolution of the line emission from the wind, and to study the ultraviolet flax from the disc in order to constrain models of the outburst.|Y
CVMJT|IUE Spectra of a Complete Sample of Cataclysmic Variables|J. R.|Thorstensen|Dartmouth College|We wish to study a large statistically complete sample of cataclysmic variables (CVs), by combining a limited number of new low-dispersion IUE spectra with existing data. This high-latitude sample, from the Palomar-Green survey, would uniquely systematize our knowledge of many CV phenomena, such as accretion disk energy distributions, wind velocities and geometries, white dwarf temperatures, and white dwarf mass limits. Near-simultaneous SWP and LWP spectra can find E(B-V).  A comprehensive optical/ near-IR study is already underway, largely at our own Michigan-Dartmouth-MIT (formerly McGraw-Hill) Observatory. From these data, we find orbital periods, energy distributions, distance estimates, and outburst, red star, and outer accretion disk properties. Together with the IUE observations, which see the white dwarfs and inner accretion disks, this study should help clarify CV structure and evolution, as well as accretion disk hydrodynamics and radiative processes.|Y
CVMPS|The Peculiar Cvs FSV 1132-11 and S193|Paula|Szkody|Washington|We will obtain time-resolved IUE spectra throughout two shifts on each of the peculiar cataclysmic variables FSVI132-11 and S193 in order to understand the cause of unusual behavior that is evident in the optical. FSV1132-11 shows a sinusoidal variation indicating a heating effect or an unusual eclipse. S193 shows large amplitude variability in both the optical and UV on timescales of 19 minutes, as well as spectral peculiarities on orbital and yearly timescales. Further information on the variations evident in the IUE regime will enable an estimate of the temperature of the regions which are responsible for these phenomena, as well as the correct interpretation of the dominant source of light.|Y
CVNCB|Coordinated IUE and EUVE Observations of Cataclysmic Variables|C. Stuart|Bowyer|UC Berkeley|We propose to obtain simultaneous observations of two AM Her type systems and one dwarf nova in outburst using IUE and EUVE and ground-based telescopes, during the sixmonth EUVE all-sky survey. We expect to detect many AM Her type systems, including our targets QQ Vul and AM Her and a number of dwarf novae such as SS Cyg and VW Hyi, if they happen to go into outburst during the survey. In AM Hers, the EUV component arises from the heated surface of the magnetic primary, while UV emission probably includes a substantial contribution from the cyclotron radiation. We therefore propose to perform phase resolved IUE observations to infer the geometry of the cyclotron emisson. region and compare it with that inferred from the EUV light curve.  In dwarf novae, the EUV component is from the inner regions of the accretion disk and/or the boundary layer between the disk and the white dwarf. The UV emission comes solely from farther out in the accretion disk. The coordinated IUE and EUVE observations of an outburst in its early stages could reveal where in the system the outburst starts and how it propagate.|Y
CVNES|Evolutionary State of Helium Transfer Cataclysmics|Edward M.|Sion|Villanova University|We propose to obtain the first ever IUE high dispersion spectra of helium-transfer cataclysmics, the AM CVn type systems PG1346+082 and V803 Cen, in their high brightness states at V = 13.0 to 14. These systems are widely believed to twin DB degenerate interacting binaries with orbital periods less than an hour. They may represent an important formation channel for single DB white dwarfs and appear to lie within the hot DB instability strip with oscillation periods similar to the non-radial g-mode pulsations of hot DB pulsators. V803 Cen exhibits a complex pattern of simultaneously present longward-shifted and shortwardshifted absorption in its low resolution IUE spectra. Our scientific objectives are: (1) look for circumstellar/circumbinary gas as outflow due to an ancient nova shell, nebular ejection associated with the formation process of the binary, mass outflow from the inner disk/boundary layer region or the DB white dwarf itself, (or infall as in WZ Sge; see Gilliland el al. 1986); (2) derive accurate edge velocities and more accurate line identifications using the precision IUE echelle wavelength (velocity) scale; (3) look for any metallic line features in the pure helium spectrum of PG 1346+082, especially the CNO resonance lines which appear in low resolution IUE spectra of AM CVn and V803 Cen but not in PG1346+082.|Y
CVNGS|Outburst Studies of High Galactic Latitude Large-Amplitude Cataclysmic|George|Sonneborn|NASA/GSFC|We propose to use IUE in a Target of Opportunity mode to study the ultrashort period large-amplitude (>= 6.0 mags) high Galactic latitude dwarf novae during outburst. Our major goal is to determine accretion disk and mass loss characteristics through study of the hot continuum from the disk and emission /absorption lines from high- temperature gas in the system as they evolve during the outburst. Comparison of high-latitude dwarf novae in outburst with their counterparts in the Galactic disk should enable us to address major questions about the nature of these unusual CVs and shed light on the outburst mechanism itself by examining systems with potentially different evolutionary and chemical histories.|Y
CVNJP|X-Ray Selected Cataclysmic Variables|Joseph O.|Patterson|Columbia University|It has been known for - 5 years now that cataclysmic variables in a state of low mass accretion (< 10^16 g/sec) become strong hard X-ray sources, and often show small, hot components in their light curves and UV flux distributions. Eclipses and UV line profile studies also establish that these components arise from the white dwarf, or from regions very close to the white dwarf. However, we do not yet understand why the white dwarfs in these systems should be so hot - nor, for that matter, why they are hard X-ray sources. Are these independent signatures of the low-M state, or are they causally related? Of the two published theories on this subject, Patterson and Raymond (1985) attributed the white dwarf heating to the effect of X-ray reprocessing, while Sion (1985) invoked the compressional heating of a white dwarf gaining mass from accretion. These theories can be put to a test by observations of systems with a very high Lx/Lopt, where the X-ray luminosity is high despite a low M The new X-ray flux-limited catalogue of Remillard et al. (1989) includes several newly discovered stars which are ideal candidates for this test.|Y
CVNJR|UV Spectra of Nearly Synchronous Magnetic Cataclysmic Variables|John C.|Raymond|Harvard CFA - SAO|The interaction between a strong white dwarf magnetic field and accreting plasma is poorly understood, yet it governs the structure of the accretion flow and the angular momentum evolution of the system. Most magnetic cataclysmic variables fall neatly into the AM Her (synchronous orbital and white dwarf spin periods, no accretion disk) or DQ Her (spin period of a few minutes, accretion disk disrupted only near the white dwarf) classes. Of the three systems which show spin periods within a few percent of the orbital periods, two are accessible to IUE BY Cam (HO538+608) looks like an AM Her star, while H0709-360 has a disk. We propose to examine and model the line and continuum spectrum of H0709-360 and BY Cam, and to follow them though the 1-2 week beat periods between their orbital and spin periods. We expect to observe the shift between one- and two pole accretion in BY Cam, and we expect to see differences in brightness and velocity before and after phase 0.5 in H0709-360 due to illumination of different sides of the disk.|Y
CVNPS|An IUE Study of Two Interesting New Novalikes|Paula|Szkody|U Washington|This proposal will accomplish IUE spectra of two new eclipsing novalike cataclysmic variables which show exceptionally strong He114686 emission and X-ray flux without the magnetic characteristics that usually accompany these diagnostics. These 2 systems (1 H0709-360 and LB1800) show many similarities to the three novalikes SW Sex, DW UMa and V1315 Aql, except for orbital periods and white dwarf masses. The brightness and long orbital period of LB1800 will allow much better timeresolved IUE spectra than possible for the above 3 in order to explore the origin of the high excitation lines and the absorbing effects created by disk/stream structures viewed edge-on. Single long exposures on 1 H0709-360,which has an orbital period right in the middle of the period gap, will allow a comparison of disk flux distributions in the gap (which should be low mass accretion systems) to those on both sides, which provides tests of evolutionary scenarios.|Y
CVNSS|Coordinated Multiwavelength Observations of Late Stages in the Outburst of Classical Novae|Sumner G.|Starrfield|Arizona State University|We propose to continue observations of four post-explosion phase novae that are still in outburst and bright enough to study with the IUE Satellite. Two of these are also accepted targets for the ROSAT Satellite and we request contemporaneous observations. We also request observing time to obtain SWP spectra of additional novae in quiescence in order to obtain UV data on 5 important problems: 1) the turnoff timescale and return to quiescence; 2) the long term evolution between outbursts; 3) the ultraviolet spectra of magnetic novae; 4) the masses of the white dwarfs; and 5) the evolution of one recurrent nova. We have obtained UV and optical data on LMC Nova 1988 #2 since October 1988 and UV, optical, and IR data on GQ Mus since March 1983. No other nova has been studied in the UV for as long as GQ Mus and it is providing unique data on the turnoff time scale. Nova LMC 1988 #2 was observed in the 11th, 12th, and 13th Episodes and was the second extragalactic nova to be studied in the UV. The outburst properties of LMC 1988 #2 differed from the four other LMC novae. IUE data will be combined with contemporaneous ground based optical, IR, and radio observations and with both KAO and ROSAT approved projects.|Y
CVODL|Flourescent Clues to the Atmospheric Shock Structure of Cool Variables|Donald G.|Luttermoser|Iowa State University|We propose to continue the investigation of the relationship between Mg II h and k emission and fluorescent lines in variable, late-type giant stars. We will obtain LWP low and high dispersion observations for the semi-regular variable R Lyr and the Mira variable R Leo. IUE fluxes for Fe I (UV44) at 2823A and 2844A will be combined with near simultaneous ground-based spectra of the Fe I (42) lines at 4202A and 4308A from McMath telescope on Kitt Peak. The Fe I (UV44) lines are seen as emission lines in almost all late-type variables, while the Fe I (42) lines are only seen as fluoresced emission features in the Mira variables. Mg II h and k are suspected to be pumping the Fe I fluorescent emission lines. These observations will enable us to answer the following questions: Are the Mg II emission features caused by outward propagating shocks in both Miras and SRs? Why are the Fe I (UV44) lines fluoresced in both SRs and Miras, while the Fe I (42) lines only seem to be fluoresced in Miras? Does atmospheric structure differ in type or only in degree between the Mira-type and semiregular variables?|Y

CVPSH|IUE Observations of ROSAT Selected Magnetic Cataclysmic Variables|Steven B.|Howell|Planetary Science Institute|The ROSAT wide field camera (WFC) conducted the first all-sky survey in the wavelength band 70200A. Seven previously unknown magnetic cataclysmic variables were discovered. These seven new magnetics represent a substantial increase to the previously known twenty, and are unique in that they are the first sample selected solely by their EUV emission. Since EUV photons are easily absorbed, these stars are located along lines of sight with little interstellar absorption. The seven stars proposed for observation here are thus ideal candidates in which to measure the UV continuum and constrain the flux in the soft Xray/EUV spectral component. We are proposing to make the first UV measurements of the ROSAT sample in order to establish their class and properties.|Y
CVQPS|Monitoring the Long Term Changes in NLs|Paula|Szkody|University of Washington|The Indiana Automated CCD Photometric Telescope has been monitoring CVs for the last 3 yrs. During this time, it has become evident that several novalike systems undergo peculiar large variations of several magnitudes, some on a periodic timescale, which appear different from "normal" novalike activity. Even though novalikes do not undergo dwarf nova outbursts, these large ranges in optical flux must represent drastic changes in the accretion disk, which is the dominant source of light in these systems. We propose a coordinated study in 1994 of the ultraviolet and optical behavior of 7 systems in order to gain a better understanding of the unique accretion behavior in novalikes as compared to dwarf novae.|Y
CVRPS|IUE Observations of New, Magnetic HEAO/ROSAT Sources|Paula|Szkody|U Washington|The use of X-ray satellites to discover cataclysmic variables has led to a group of objects that favor large X-ray/opt ratios, large variability and high magnetic fields. The availability of IUE observations in conjunction with the X-ray fluxes enables the study of the energetics of the accretion, abundance anomalies and the possibility of accretion disk vs accretion column geometries. We propose to obtain IUE short and long wavelength spectra of 5 HEAO/ROSAT objects which have available ground-based optical photometry and spectroscopy which indicate magnetic interactions to pursue the continuum and line behavior in comparison to the known properties of normal accretion disk CV systems.|Y

CYOJE|Mapping the Chromosphere of 31 Cygni|Joel A.|Eaton|Tennessee State University|Thirty-one Cygni (K4 I + B4 V) is perhaps the most important of the zeta Aur binaries in that it has the greatest separation, cleanest eclipse, and best determined orbit. Previous studies of groundbased and IUE data show the chromosphere and size of the K star change little from eclipse to eclipse. Its next total eclipse will be centered at 20 February 1993. We are proposing observations of this eclipse (1) to measure the strengths of intrinsic, collisionally excited chromospheric lines so that 31 Cyg may be related to single K supergiant stars and (2) to use chromospheric absorption lines to map the physical properties of the chromosphere in great detail. These measures will be combined with complementary data from HST (we hope) and NSO to form the first truly selfconsistent, definitive model of a cool supergiant's chromosphere.|Y
CYPJE|Long-Term Observations of 31 Cygni|Joel|Eaton|Tennessee State University|Thirty-one Cygni is perhaps the most important of the zeta Aur binaries in that it has the greatest separation, cleanest eclipse, and best determined orbit. After the atmospheric eclipse of 1992-93, it will have the best existing combination of groundbased plus IUE data. In preparation for this eclipse, I have monitored the spectrum for three years over phases 0.66-0.94. I am proposing to continue monitoring the system (1) to study the isotropy and time dependence of the star's wind, (2) to find if accretion onto the B star depends appreciably on orbital phase, and (3) to refine the orbit of the B star.|Y

DAHJH|Measurement of a Gravitational Redshift With IUE|Jay B.|Holberg|Arizona|We propose to measure the gravitational redshift of the DA white dwarf CD38 10980 by making a unique determination of the differential radial velocity between CD-38 10980 and its G5Y companion HR 6094. At present there is a significant, apparent conflict between a recent result based on an IUE high dispersion spectrum of CD38 10980 and published ground based results. In principle it will be possible to resolve this conflict through a comparison of our proposed differential measurement with a current ground based effort to redetermine the gravitational redshift. Such a resolution should lead to the unambiguous location of the region of formation for the weak, narrow-lined features seen in CD-38 10980.|Y
DAIJH|Hottest Most Luminous DA White Dwarfs|Jay B.|Holberg|Arizona|We propose to obtain low dispersion SWP spectra of a sample of objects which represent either pro-white dwarfs or perhaps the earliest phases of DA white dwarf evolution. In either case these objects constitute a unique sample of stars, at a stage of stellar evolution, not previously observed with IUE. Studies have shown (Fleming, Liebert and Green, 1986) that these stars, all of which are relatively faint, represent the most extreme DA-like objects present in the Palomar-Green survey, having luminosities of Mv - 7.7 and temperatures between 70,000 to 100,000 K. It can additionally be shown, by direct comparisons of Balmer profiles, that these stars possess either significantly higher temperatures and/or lower gravities than the hottest recognized DA white dwarfs (e.g. G191 B2B, HZ 43, Feige 24 and GD 246). Additional ground based observations can do little to improve temperature estimates for these stars. We demonstrate how SWP spectra can be used to achieve better temperature data and hence to more precisely locate these objects, within the H-R diagram. relative to the hottest DA white dwarfs and planetary nebulae. In conjunction with existing ground based data and hoped for EXOSAT soft X-ray observations the proposed IUE observations should lead to improved estimates of effective temperature, luminosly, gravity, and atmospheric composition. In addition, one of the hot DA candidates shows a residual planetary nebula emission spectrum. Ultraviolet spectrophotometry will permit us to (1) compare photospheric and nebular estimates of the central star temperature, and (2) determine helium and carbon abundances from the strong C IV and He II resonance lines not accessible with our ground-based observations.|Y
DAJJH|Youngest DA White Dwarfs|Jay B.|Holberg|Arizona|We propose to obtain low dispersion SWP spectra of a sample of objects which represent either pro-white dwarfs or perhaps the earliest phases of DA white dwarf evolution.

DALDK|Ultraviolet Observations of a New, Extremely Hot DA White Dwarf|Detlev|Koester|Louisiana State|Observing time is requested to obtain low-resolution spectra of a newly discovered DA white dwarf (NGC6405-1). A preliminary temperature determination of Teff = 70000 K based on Balmer line equivalent widths shows this object to be the hottest DA with a reasonably well determined effective temperature, and possibly the hottest DA known. DA white dwarfs with temperatures above 60000 K are extremely rare, whereas several groups of white dwarfs with helium-dominated atmospheres (DO, DAO, PG1159) are well known in this range. The reasons for this distribution, which is in sharp contrast with observations at lower temperature, are not understood at present. The primary aim is to obtain a Lyman-alpha profile with a small aperture exposure in the SWP camera in order to improve the temperature determination and to search for HeII  l640, which is expected to be the strongest He line, if traces of helium are present (most extremely hot white dwarfs show this line, confirming that they are not ordinary DA but rather DO or DAO). Depending on the results of this observation a second spectrum using the large aperture will be obtained with either the SWP or the LWP camera to obtain the true energy distribution in the ultraviolet region.|Y
DAMFW|Stratified Atmospheres in the DAB White Dwarfs|Francois|Wesemael|Canada|The rare hybrid DAB white dwarfs, with their hydrogen-rich atmospheres and weak helium lines, represent the only documented case where a stratified atmospheric structure provides an improved fit to the observations compared to a homogeneouslymixed hydrogen-helium atmosphere. Our ongoing Montreal-Cambridge-Tololo Survey of blue, subluminous objects in the southern hemisphere has uncovered two new objects in this class which, up to now, contained only a single star (GD 323). Because complete energy distributions must be combined with optical spectroscopy to ascertain the stratified nature of these objects, we propose to acquire low-dispersion IUE observations of our latest discovery. These observations, when combined with existing optical photometry and spectroscopy and with stratified model atmosphere calculations, will permit us to confirm the particular nature of this new, and important spectroscopic class of white dwarfs, as well as measure the thickness of the overlying hydrogen layer - a quantity which can be directly confronted to the predictions of stellar evolution theory.|Y
DAMGB|Temperatures of Hot DA White Dwarfs|Gibor S.|Basri|UC Berkekey|We propose to continue our FUV observations of the known hot (Teff > 25,000 K) DA (predominantly hydrogen atmosphere) white dwarfs for the purpose of obtaining their effective temperatures. Accurate temperatures for these objects serve several purposes: determination of the upper temperature limit, better definition of the luminosity function/cooling sequence, and the theoretical interpretation of trace element abundances. The temperatures will also be needed for analysis of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) data which will be obtained for numerous hot DA white dwarfs in upcoming sky survey missions. Our previous FUV data analysis efforts resulted in a substantial improvement in the absolute calibration of the IUE instruments, and showed that the IUE continuum fluxes could be used to determine the effective temperatures of the hot DA's to an accuracy of typically 5% or better. The proposed new observations will include (when feasible) small aperture observations with the SWP camera which will be used for temperature and gravity determinations based on fitting the Lyman a line profile. Independent ground-based observations will also be made of the Balmer lines of these stars, giving another temperature and gravity measurement. The complete data sets will provide unambiguous determinations of the properties of the targets. For example, the FUV continuum fluxes may in some cases be attenuated due to dust absorption. The use of the FUV continuum alone would then result in an erroneously low temperature. However, a comparison of the measured FUV flux with the predicted flux based on the line profile temperatures would give a measurement of the attenuation. If the star is very hot and the reddening is significant, the absorption in the damping wings of interstellar Lyman cc can be used for a direct measurement of the neutral hydrogen column, thereby giving the dust-to-gas ratio in that line of sight. The primary usage of the interstellar medium properties will be for subsequent EUV data analysis. We also intend to use the combined Balmer and Lyman-alpha fine profile measurements to attempt  to detect the presence of stratification of the atmospheres of the white dwarfs. Determination of HeII 1640 A line strengths (or upper limits) will also be used as a stratification indicator.  Our examination of the published data for spectroscopically identified white dwarfs and of the IUE Log has resulted in the identification of -25 white dwarfs hotter than 30,000 K which it is feasible and worth while to either observe for the first time or else reobserve with TUE. In the case of targets which have previously been observed, we only intend to take spectra in a different configuration than that used previously (such as small aperture SWP), except for those cases in which the previous exposures were not of suitable quality for the analyses which we are carrying out. All observations will be made in low dispersion mode; none of the proposed targets are bright enough for high dispersion observations. The lengths of the exposures required are such that the preponderance of the observations should be done during US1 shifts, in order to obtain spectra of sufficient quality. We are asking for only half the time necessary for performing the full set of observations; we anticipate proposing again for the following year in order to complete the work. The complete target list is being submitted at this time in order to achieve the maximum flexibility in scheduling the observations.|Y

DAOJH|A Study of a Sample of EUV Selected Hot DA Dwarfs|Jay B.|Holberg|U Arizona|We propose to obtain low dispersion IUE SWP spectra of thirteen hot white DA dwarfs recently discovered to be EUV sources by the ROSAT Wide Field Camera. Recent studies of twenty DA white dwarfs detected by ROSAT reveal that it is not possible to account for the observed EUV and soft X-ray fluxes with simple He opacity alone. Until now virtually all analyses of DA soft X-ray observations have been interpreted in terms of trace He abundances, in either a homogeneous or stratified photosphere. It is now clear that other opacity sources will be required to interpret these observations. This recent ROSAT work relies on accurate temperatures and gravities determined by IUE and ground based observations. We propose to obtain IUE observations of a sample of DA white dwarfs selected solely form the ROSAT survey.|Y
DAOJL|DA White Dwarfs with Peculiar Line Profiles|James W.|Liebert|U Arizona - Steward Obser|We seek ultraviolet spectrophotometry and Lyman-alpha line profile measurements for two peculiar, apparently DA white dwarfs which have been discovered to have peculiar Balmer line profiles. The optical profiles cannot be fit with any values of T and log g, and cannot be explained by rotation, a magnetic field, a composite spectrum, or a stratified atmosphere. The IUE data are needed to establish whether the two objects are stellar in nature, or opticallythick accretion disks. If they harbor hot stellar components, the ultraviolet data are needed to establish the temperatures, which may be valuable for further attempts to understand the unusual line broadening.|Y
DAPCB|Heavy Element Abundance in Hot DA White Dwarfs|C. Stuart|Bowyer|UC Berkeley - CEA|Recent extreme ultraviolet all-sky surveys (UK Wide Field Camera; NASA Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer) have uncovered a wealth of bright white dwarfs mapping the hot end of the H-rich cooling sequence. We have analyzed more than a hundred of these objects (DA white dwarfs) and we summarize our findings. We have essentially confirmed the correlation between the soft X-ray flux deficiency and the effective temperature, first suggested by Petre, Shipman, & Canizares: more than a dozen objects show the presence of an important EUV/soft X-ray opacity source. Recent investigations using EXOSAT and IUE spectroscopy have indicated that photospheric heavy elements (mainly Fe) might be responsible for most of the soft X-ray extinction. We have selected six (6) of these stars for their exceptional properties and we propose to obtain UV high-dispersion spectroscopy to complement EUV spectroscopy with the EUVE, scheduled in the near future. The study of this enlarged sample is a major step toward a clear description of the physical mechanisms (diffusion, selective radiation pressure, and possible mass loss) at play in white dwarf photospheres. Corollary results on the ISM are also expected for some bright objects following recent EUVE spectra showing the presence of substantial ionization in the ISM.|Y
DAPJH|IUE Observations of EUV Selected Hot DA White Dwarfs|Jay B.|Holberg|U Arizona|We propose to obtain high dispersion IUE SWP spectra of five hot white DA dwarfs discovered as EUV sources by the ROSAT Wide Field Camera. Recent studies of DA white dwarfs detected by ROSAT reveal that it is not possible to account for the observed EUV and soft X-ray fluxes with simple He opacity alone. Until now virtually all analyses of DA soft X-ray observations have been interpreted in terms of trace He abundances, in either a homogeneous or stratified photosphere. It is now clear that other opacity sources will be required to interpret these observations, in particular opacity due to metal ions. Our proposed observations will seek direct evidence that such ions are indeed responsible for the soft X-ray opacity in these stars. We also will obtain large and small aperture spectra of each star in order to accurately establish the temperatures and gravities.|Y
DBBPF|Stellar Corrections to Diffuse Background Observations|Paul D.|Feldman|Johns Hopkins|It is proposed to obtain far-ultraviolet low-resolution absolute spectra of two high-galactic-latitude stars, in order to correct the Aries rocket data of Anderson et al. for stellar contamination. The result will be an improvement in our knowledge of the high-galactic-latitude far-ultraviolet background radiation, which may be the light of galactic-plane B stars scattering off interstellar dust grains, may be of cosmological origin, or may have some other origin.|Y
DBDAW|Correlation of Far-UV Extinction with the Strength of the Lamda 4430 Diffuse Interstellar Band|Adolf N.|Witt|Toledo|It is proposed to obtain low-resolution spectra with both cameras of the IUE of two samples of reddened early-type stars, which stand out by the fact that the ratio A(4430A)/E(B-V) deviates from the average by more than two standard deviations. By comparison of these spectra with those of essentially unreddened standard stars of identical spectral types we plan to derive individual extinction curves for the program stars. A correlation study between the strength of the diffuse interstellar band at 4430 and several characteristics of the far-UV extinction will be carried out. The special sample of stars which includes only objects with very strong 4430 or very weak 4430 for their observed reddening in the visual, should permit a conclusive resolution of the question whether the unidentified diffuse band at 4430 and possibly the other related bands as well are caused by small grains which are also believed to be responsible for the rise of the far-UV extinction shortward of 1500.|Y
DBMMP|EO Aurigae: A Non-Conformist Binary|Mirek J.|Plavec|UCLA|I propose to observe the detached binary system EO Aurigae which seems to violate the established relations mass - luminosity and/or mass - spectral type - radius - luminosity. This system was reported by Pearce to have masses of each component larger than 20 m(sun), but the visibility of the secondary spectrum was challenged by Popper. According to Popper, the star whose spectrum is clearly visible is of spectral type B3, while the more massive and more luminous component has weaker spectral lines. This is a quite unusual situation, and the UV spectra promise to verify the spectral types.  Popper's explanation is that just by chance, the less massive component is of spectral type B3, at which type the He I lines are strongest, while the more massive component is between O9-B2. This seems to be a plausible hypothesis, but without ultraviolet spectra it remains a hypothesis. Moreover, I suspect another puzzle: If the less clearly visible star is significantly more massive and according Popper the masses should be 6-8 m(sun) and 10-12 m(sun) respectively - then the more massive star may be such more evolved; in this case it is rather puzzling that it should have a higher surface brightness (which it has, since it is eclipsed in primary eclipse).  High-dispersion UV spectra are obtainable in the US2 shifts. There is good hope that the two components can be distinguished clearly in the UV, and reliable parameters for this fairly massive star can be derived.|Y
DCBDD|Spectra of Cepheid Variables and Late-Type Stars|D. A.|Doschek|NRL|We propose to apply spectroscopic diagnostic techniques developed by us for the analysis of NRL solar spectra recorded from Skylab to spectra of Cepheid variables and bright K-type stars observed by IUE in the ~1100 to ~2000 A range. The analysis gives the electron density and emitting volumes of upper chromospheric and transition zone plasma as a function of temperature between about 4 x 10^4 K and 2 x 10^5 K. The analysis may also yield information on the turbulence and radial motions of plasma in this temperature range. The NRL spectrograph had instrumental parameters quite similar to the IUE instrument, i.e., the short wavelength range was 1100 to ~2000 A and the spectral resolution was 0.06 A.|Y
DCBES|Ultraviolet Observations of Quasistellar Objects and the Intergalactic and Intracluster Medium|Edward|Schmidt|Nebraska|The IUE satellite will be used to study Cepheids in the ultraviolet. Low dispersion spectra will be obtained at various phases in the cycles of several stars to learn what features are strong in the ultraviolet, to determine how these features vary in time, to learn the properties of the coronachromosphere transition region and to attempt to find the origin of the ultraviolet bumps observed by OAO-2 in the light curve of beta Doradus. Several Cepheids will be observed in the high dispersion mode in order to obtain data on the emission cores of the Mg II h and k lines as well as any other lines which prove to be strong enough to observe. The high dispersion data will allow a study of the chromospheres, possible circumstellar material and possible mass loss to be made.|Y
DCCDM|Ultraviolet Studies of the Components of Cepheid Variables|D. H.|McNamara|Brigham Young University|We propose to acquire UV spectra of the companions of 10 Cepheids. The photometric classification of seven of these companion stars (ground based data) will be checked with the UV spectra. These new spectra should provide an excellent foundation to discuss the masses, and ages of the Cepheids. In addition, three Cepheids with spectroscopic orbits will be investigated to identify the spectroscopic properties of the companions.|Y
DCCES|Ultraviolet Spectroscopy of Bright Cepheids|Edward|Schmidt|Nebraska|The IUE satellite will be used for further observations of Cepheids in the ultraviolet. Present data indicate the presence of a substantial chromosphere in a 10-day Cepheid, beta Dor, and the absence of one in the prototype delta Cep. More stars will be studied to see what pattern exists. The Mg II resonance doublet will be monitored at high dispersion for emission cores, and the short wavelength region will be monitored at low resolution for O I and other emission lines. The fluxes from the short wavelength spectra will help confirm or deny reported irregularities in the ultraviolet light curves, while the high dispersion data will allow the study of possible mass loss and circumstellar material. Ground based observations of the Ca II H and K emission will also be made to correlate with the IUE data.|Y
DCDAH|An Investigation of the Beat Cepheid TU CAS|A. A.|Henden|SASC|Beat or double-mode cepheids (cepheids pulsating with two or more periods) are apparently undermassive relative to evolutionary models by a factor of three to four. This large discrepancy cannot be resolved by adjustments to evolutionary or pulsational calculations. The only satisfactory solution so far proposed is to change the basic composition of double-mode cepheids, making their atmospheres helium rich. This enrichment process could be caused by a stellar wind. We propose to test for such a wind by observing the MgII resonance doublet at 2800 A and other features and comparing those features with ones in similar "normal" cepheid spectra for evidence of line asymmetries. one double-mode cepheid will be observed, along with a comparison single-period cepheid with similar period, color, amplitude and light-curve shape. UV spectra will be compared with ground-based spectra of the double-mode cepheid and of the comparison star in an effort to understand the occurrence and causes of stellar winds in short-period cepheids.|Y
DCDNE|Ultraviolet Spectroscopy of the Binary Cepheid SU Cygni|Nancy Remage|Evans|Toronto|The spectroscopic orbit derived by one of us (NRE) for the binary classical Cepheid SU Cygni gives a mass function of 1.26  0.12(3sigma)M(sun). If the Cepheid has evolved without mass loss, the 3 sigma lower limit on its mass (4. 56M[sun]) is 77% of the evolutionary mass. The photometric properties of the companion in the optical region place a rough upper limit on the companion mass of 5.5 M., hence an upper limit of 6.13 Me[sun] on the Cepheid mass. There is at least 1 chance in 5 that the companion is eclipsed, but this eclipse will be very difficult to detect in the optical region.  We wish to obtain high resolution LWR spectra of the companion near the ascending and descending nodes of the orbit in order to determine the mass ratio of the binary system. We wish to obtain low resolution LWR and SWP spectra to search for the eclipse of the companion, derive the relative luminosities of the two stars, obtain the ultraviolet light curve of the Cepheid, and classify the spectrum of the companion. We expect these observations to place such tight limits on the Cepheid mass that the theoretical models will be severely tested.|Y
DCEEB|Observation of Ultraviolet Light VAriations of POP II Cepheids|Erika|Bohm-Vitense|Washington|We want to study the changes of the ultraviolet energy distributions in Pop II cepheids, and see whether emission lines during maximum light can be detected.  The gradient of the energy distributions for longer wavelengths (lambda >1900A) together with studies of the discontinuities at 2600A and at 1700A (for the brighter stars) will permit to determine the metal abundances and the effective temperatures as a function of phase. For k Pav we will in connection with radial velocity measurements be able to determine radii. Comparision with stellar evolution calculations will yield masses for these stars.  A comparison of spectra for W Vir and ST Pup both with periods of 17^d but vastly different spectral types will be very interesting. The metal abundances are expected to be very different.|Y
DCEES|Ultraviolet Spectroscopy of Bright Cepheids|Edward G.|Schmidt|Nebraska|The ultraviolet spectra of five Cepheids have been studied with IUE in previous years. The data have given a picture of the time variation of the chromospheric emission but have left several questions to be studied further. The spectra previously obtained are not deep enough to show the presence of transition region material in these stars and not deep enough to show the presence of a chromosphere at any time during the pulsational cycle in delta Cep. Additionally, only a few exposures were obtained of l Car and the phase coverage was inadequate. The present proposal is to obtain deeper exposures of three short period Cepheids, delta Cep, beta Dor and zeta Gem, and to obtain better phase coverage of l Car.|Y
DCFCS|Ultraviolet Observations of Three Dwarf Cepheids|Conrad R.|Sturch|CSC|Ultraviolet observations of three dwarf Cepheids (VZ Cnc, SX Phe, and AI Vel) have been obtained with the ANS. Analysis of these observations (Sturch and WU 1982) reveals that the flux distributions observed for each of these objects exhibit UV deficiencies which increase monotonically with decreasing wavelengths. The largest UV deficiencies are noted for SX Phe which has been identified with group of dwarf Cepheids with low metallicity and low luminosity, two attributes that are expected to have opposite effects on the UV flux distribution. It is proposed to obtain low dispersion IUE spectra of the three stars throughout each of their light cycles. Such observations will identify spectral features responsible for the flux deficiencies and will provide data necessary for a detailed comparison with model atmospheres. Knowledge of atmospheric parameters will lead to a better understanding of the evolutionary status of dwarf Cepheids.|Y
DCFSP|Chromospheres of Type I and Type II Cepheids of Long Period|Sidney B.|Parsons|NASA/GSFC|A Program to study the chromospheres of Type I ( classical ) and Type II Cepheids of long period is proposed. Among the few classical Cepheids studied previously with IUE the Mg II emission strength appears to be much greater at longer pulsation periods. We wish to extend those studies by observing additional Cepheids with Periods of 16 to 68 days and exploring correlations of emission width and strength with period, hence with luminosity. The ultraviolet spectra of old Type II Cepheids have hardly been explored, and differences from Type I in Mg II strength and UV flux distribution will Provide new information on differences in atmospheric structure. Cepheids in the LMC are too faint to reach with feasible exposure times, but two of the very luminous supergiants found recently to have Ca II emission and circumstellar envelopes will be examined for Mg II emission strength|Y
DCGEB|Variations of POP. II Cepheid UV Energy Distributions|Erika|Bohm-Vitense|Washington|We want to observe the changes of the ultraviolet energy distribution of the population II Cepheid kappa Pav and the suspected population II Cepheid SZ Tau. The observations of the continuum energy distributions will give us log Z/Z(sun)  and the change in Teff as a function of pulsational phase.  We would also like to follow the properties of the outward moving shock by observing the changes in the emission lines. For the previously observed population II Cepheids ST Pup and W Vir, we saw emission lines develop shortly after maximum light. No more observing time was available to follow the changes. For the bright Cepheids kappa Pav and SZ Tau we will be able to follow the evolution of these emission lines. The ratio of the SiIII] to CIII] lines at 1892 and 1909A (both observed in ST Pup and W Vir) will give us the change in densities for the outward moving shock. Perhaps we will be able to determine rough values for the velocities and in that way probe the outer atmospheres of the Cepheids.|Y
DCGNE|The Mass of the High Luminosity Ceoheid T Monocerotis|Nancy Remage|Evans|CSC|The recently derived orbital velocity variations of the high luminosity cepheid T Monocerotis (Coulson, 1983) allow possible combinations of masses for the cepheid and its companion to be derived from the mass function. Although the orbit is not complete, it is clear that either (1) the orbit must be very eccentric (e > .6) or (2) the companion must itself be double or else (3) mass of the cepheid must be less than the evolutionary mass (10.8M(sun)).  The first possibility is being investigated by ground based observations, and a high eccentricity will be recognized within a few years. This proposal is a request for IUE observations to determine whether the companion is itself a binary. For this purpose two suitably spaced high dispersion spectra of T Mon are required to search for velocity variations of the companion. Conversely, if the companion is single, its orbital velocity should lead to a broadened correlation function, allowing a strong argument to be made that the system contains only 2 stars. Information about the mass of a high luminosity cepheid is particularly important in understanding stars used in extragalactic distance calibration.|Y
DCHDM|A Study of Mass Loss in a Long-Period Cepheid Variable|Dermott J.|Mullan|Delaware|We propose to study mass loss in a Cepheid. The target star is unique among Cepheids in that it lies at the center of 4-5 concentric rings of dust. The ring structure suggests that the Cepheid (RS Puppis) has experienced several mass loss events or shock ejection events in the recent past. The mechanism by which Cepheids lose mass is currently unknown, but since RS Pup shows signs of having experienced mass loss in the past, it is a prime candidate for searching for mass loss at the present time. With this in mind, we propose to obtain high resolution magnesium line profiles to search for circumstellar absorption at or beyond the escape speed. Although there is as yet no proof that it is the stellar pulsation which provides the mechanical energy to power mass loss (if any) from a Cepheid, it is natural to inquire if the mass loss varies during the pulsation cycle. Therefore, we propose to obtain MgII line profiles at specially chosen phases in the cycle (e.g. at maximum acceleration and deceleration, and at the "bump" on the light curve) as well as at light maximum. Because of the long exposures necessary, this is a collaborative effort with European proposers.|Y
DCHNE|Reddening and Temperature Scales for Cepheids|Nancy Remage|Evans|CSC|Extragalactic studies rely heavily on the classical Cepheid periodluminosity relation. Within the last a renewed effort has been made to find long period Cepheids in clusters and associations in our galaxy which are comparable to those most easily observed in external galaxies. The uncertainty produced by differential reddening in clusters and particularly in associations is a major contributor to the uncertainly in the period-luminosity relation. This is especially a problem for the long period Cepheids which are found only in associations. The aim of this proposal is to provide a test of the reddening values determined from visual photometry by examining the stars' energy distributions from the ultraviolet to the infrared, a 20,000 A baseline. LWP low dispersion spectra of 10 cluster and association Cepheids will be combined with recent B, V, R, I, and J, H, K photometry. The dereddened fluxes for the Cepheids obtained at known phases will be compared to those of carefully chosen nonvariable supergiant stars. Improved knowledge of the reddenings leads directly to improved calibration of the distance scale. (A proposal is also being submitted to investigate the reddening and temperature scales of field Cepheids, particularly long period ones by observing long and short period Cepheids at high and low reddenings.)|Y
DCIES|Chromospheres of Delta Scuti Stars|Edward G.|Schmidt|Nebraska|Observing time is requested with IUE to study the chromospheres Of several Dwarf Cepheids throughout their cycles of variation. This is an extension of work on the chromospheres of classical Cepheids and will serve to extend Our understanding of chromospheres in pulsating stars to a regime of higher temperature, higher gravity and smaller pulsational amplitude. This will allow us to gain insight into both the energization of chromospheres by pulsation and into details of the pulsation itself.|Y
DCINE|Long Period and Overtone Cepheids|Nancy Remage|Evans|CSC|Long period Cepheids are particularly important in extragalactic distance calibration. The masses from pulsation models of double mode Cepheids ("beat masses") present the largest discrepancy with evolutionary masses of any method of mass estimation. IUE spectra of an 18 day Cepheid, YZ Car, and a double mode Cepheid, Y Car, can be used to search for the companions of these binary Cepheids. Main sequence absolute magnitudes for these companions can be determined from their temperatures, and hence the distances of the Cepheids can be calibrated. In addition, the parameters of the companions can be combined with existing orbits to put an upper limit on the mass of YZ Car, which is likely to be smaller than some mass calibrations, and a lower limit on the mass of Y Car which is likely to be larger than its "beat mass".|Y
DCKEB|Emission Lines of the Long Period Copheid L Carinae|Erika|Bohm-Vitense|Washington|We propose to observe the time dependence of the ultraviolet emission line fluxes in the Cepheid l Carinae. Previous observations by Schmidt and Parsons have shown that l Carinae appears to be the only Cepheid observed so far to show the high ionization lines up to C IV. This Cepheid therefore appears to be the best star to study the rise and decay of emission lines of different stages of ionization. During the phases of increasing emission we should be able to see the phase delay for the emission of high ionization line, as compared to low ionization lines, corresponding to the increasing amount of heating and the propagation of the ionization front through the surface layers when the transition region is built up. The amount of heating measures the amount of energy being deposited.  If the emission is related to the onset of convection during the cool phases of the pulsation, as seems to be the case. then the rise and decay of the ultraviolet emission lines will be able to teach us a lot about the timescales for the generation of the mechanical flux heating the chromosphere and transition laver. This in turn will tell us something about the nature of this flux and about the time dependence of the developing convection.|Y
DCKNE|The Cepheid + Supergiant Eclipsing System BM Cas|Nancy Remage|Evans|Canada|BM Cas is an eclipsing binary for which Fernie has recently found magnitude variations from the secondary best explained by Cepheid pulsation. Because a Cepheid in an eclipsing binary provides the possibility of determining both its mass and radius, extensive photometric and spectroscopic observations are being carried out. In addition, the system is the shortest period eclipsing system containing a supergiant (the primary is A71a), and the only eclipsing supergiant system with an evolved secondary. We infer that some mass transfer has occurred but more must follow, and consequently predict circumstellar matter within the system. We also infer that the Cepheid is on the first crossing of the instability strip, which is unique.  IUE observations at selected points in the orbit will aid the interpretation of the system. Specifically, we want to make one SWP low disperison observation and LWP low dispersion observations at primary and secondary minimum and at the orbital phase when accretion shock cone absorption has been seen in other supergiant systems, as well as at the maximum and minimum phases of Cepheid pulsation. With these spectra, we will investigate the flux distribution to confirm the Cepheid hypothesis and determine temperatures of the two components. We will also investigate definitive circumstellar matter diagnostics, particularly MgII emission lines and other emission lines to explore the distribution of circumstellar material within the system. In conjunction with the H-alpha velocities, MgII emission will tell in which direction mass transfer is occurring.|Y
DCKTT|Cepheid Temperatures: Delta Cephei|Terry J.|Teays|CSC IUE|Cepheid temperature calibration plays a major part in calculating evolutionary and pulsation masses, and investigating the structure of the instability strip. We propose to obtain a homogenous set of SWP and LWP observations of Delta Cep which will span its temperature range. Because effective gravity and microturbulence variations also affect the ultraviolet flux, the observations will be made at phases for which these parameters remain constant (during the descending branch of the light curve). These observations will be combined with visual spectrophotometric scans, BVRIJK photometry, and IRAS observations to map the flux distribution of Delta Cep over its temperature range. Comparison between these flux distributions, and those of nonvariable supergiants, will show how closely Cepheids mimic nonvariables. Comparison with model atmospheres will let us determine a temperature - (B-V) calibration from a wider wavelength range than has previously been used.  With any additional time, we will observe 2 Cepheids and an F51b nonvariable supergiant, which have recently been found to have orbital velocity variations. Comparison with appropriate Delta Cep spectra will determine whether there is any light from a main sequence companion. Detection of a companion provides a luminosity calibration of the Cepheid. In addition, the question of whether the nonvariable supergiant is within the instability strip hinges on the differential reddening within NGC 129. This can be tested by comparison of its ultraviolet flux with that of the Cepheid DL Cas, also a cluster member.|Y
DCLDS|Quantitative Chromospheric Diagnostics in Cepheids: Zeta Gem|Dimitar D.|Sasselov|Canada|Periodic pulsations have been recently considered as a process critical to heating and extending a low-gravity stellar atmosphere. The continuum behavior of classical Cepheids is well correlated with the chromospheric emission (Schmidt and Parsons, 1984a,b). The chromospheres of Cepheids have been studied for many years and very extensively with the I.U.E. However, up until now the available data have been analysed only qualitatively, as far as Cepheids' extended atmospheres and chromospheres are concerned.  We propose to obtain some additional observations, supplementing in a unique way existing I.U.E. data, in order to construct a time-dependent model chromosphere for the Cepheid zeta Gem. The data obtained will enable us to use effects of radiative interlocking and density sensitive ratios within multiplets among chromospheric lines. With these independent and reliable constraints, and together with high-quality infrared (He 10830A) and optical observations, we shall try to precisely model the Cepheid chromosphere.|Y
DCLNE|The Mass of the Cepheid SU Cygni|Nancy Remage|Evans|Canada|Classical Cepheids are important both in extragalactic distance calibration and also in stellar evolution studies. For the last twenty years, there has been a disagreement about the most fundamental parameter of these stars, their mass (" the Cepheid mass problem"). Masses inferred from evolutionary tracks for stars with known luminosities and temperatures are as much as a factor of two larger than masses derived from the period-mean density relation from pulsation calculations. Mass loss and the treatment of convective overshoot near the main sequence are two important uncertainties in evolutionary calculations.  On IUE high dispersion spectra, the orbital velocity amplitude of hot main sequence companions can be measured. Results for the system with the highest orbital velocity amplitude, SU Cyg (Evans and Bolton, 1988), provide a lower limit to the mass of the Cepheid of 5.9  0.6 MG, which is very close to the evolutionary mass (5.8 to 5.5 M(sun) for evolutionary tracks without convective overshoot or mass loss. Note that this mass limit is purely dynamical; no assumptions are made about the masses of the companions. Because of the high orbital velocity amplitude of SU Cyg, the percentage accuracy of the amplitude should be at least a factor of 2 smaller than for any other known Cepheid system. Since the companion is itself a short period binary, it is the long period orbital amplitude of the center of mass of the short period system which must be determined from the IUE spectra to determine the lower limit to the mass of the Cepheid . The purpose of this proposal is to obtain 4 additional spectra at both maximum and minimum velocities of the long period orbit. These will be obtained within about a week when the Cepheid is at minimum light so that both the short period orbit (period 4167) and the amplitude of the long period orbit (period 1.5 years) will be better determined. With the requested 4 US2 shifts, we can reduce the uncertainty of the Cepheid mass limit to 0.2 M[sun] This provides an important constraint to both evolutionary and pulsation calculations.|Y
DCLTT|The Unique Type II Cepheid Ru Cam|Terry J.|Teays|CSC|RU Cam is a unique star, it is classified as a Type II Cepheid with a period of 22 days, but has a number of peculiarities, including its late spectral type and the presence of carbon star characteristics, especially at minimum light. it had been observed since 1907 and displayed a V light curve amplitude of about 1 mag. Suddenly in 1966 it underwent a dramatic decrease in its pulsation amplitude, virtually to the point of cessation, and has never recovered its former large amplitude behavior. It has continued to pulsate with rather irregular amplitude, never exceeding 0.2 magnitudes, but with the mean light and color essentially unchanged from that prior to the decline. Attempts to measure the temperature of the star, along with the assumption that it obeys the Type II Cepheid PL relation, place the star near, or slightly beyond, the red edge of the empirical Population II instability strip.  This proposal is to obtain the first studies of the UV spectral variations of this star as a function of pulsation phase. There is only one really useful image in the IUE archives, and judging from the variations that are exhibited by the prototype Pop. II Cepheid, W Vir, it is necessary to obtain exposures at a variety of phases. In addition to comparison with Type II Cepheids, comparisons will be made to IUE images of carbon stars to see how this object may relate to them. The Mg II data are particularly important for the study of atmospheric shocks and/or chromospheric activity.|Y

DCMTT|Cepheid Temperatures|Terry J.|Teays|CSC - IUE|Cepheid temperature calibration plays a major part in calculating evolutionary and pulsation masses, and investigating the structure of the instability strip. We have previously obtained a homogeneous set of SWP and LWP low dispersion observations of delta Cep, spanning its temperature range. Comparison with Kurucz model atmospheres has confirmed that the ultraviolet fluxes are very sensitive to temperature. Temperatures determined from these spectra are on average 170 K cooler than the Cox-Kraft colortemperature calibration. When delta Cep and nonvariable supergiants are compared using a color created from the SWP and LWP spectra, m(1800 A) - m(2800 A), each forms a tight sequence as a function of (B-V), However, the supergiants consistently have more flux at 1800 A than the Cepheids at the same (B-V). All the other pairs of well exposed SWP/LWP Cepheid spectra taken on the same day in the archives (about a dozen) show the same effect, except during phases when the pulsation "piston" affects the atmosphere (0 = 0.8-1.0). At these phases, the Cepheid colors are similar to the nonvariable supergiant spectra, suggesting that effective surface gravity may be responsible for the difference between the Cepheids at other phases and the nonvaxiable supergiants.  In this project we will take an additional spectrum of delta Cep at the "piston" phase to investigate the effect for a short period star. We would also like to obtain spectra of I Car (period 35 days) at hot and cool phases to extend the temperature range for which ultraviolet temperatures are available. In addition, a pair of archival SWP/LWP spectra for l Car at the "piston" phase will make it possible to look for surface gravity effects in a long period star. Pairs of SWP/LWP spectra are also necessary for comparison with other Cepheid spectra to search for excess light from main sequence companions.|Y
DCNNE|Classical Cepheid Luminosities|Nancy Remage|Evans|York University - Canada|The classical Cepheid period-luminosity-color (PLC) relation is one, of the cornerstones of extragalactic research. IUE spectra make it possible to "temperature resolve" Cepheids in binary systems with a hot companion. By studying the companion from 1200 to 2000 A (uncontaminated by light from the Cepheid), it is possible to determine a very accurate spectral class and hence absolute magnitude for the companion. From that, the distance to the system can be inferred. Tile binary Cepheids from this proposal and previous proposals approximately double the list of PLC calibrators. In addition to improving the slope and zeropoint of the PLC, the new calibrators call be used to investigate overtone mode pulsation, the width of the instability strip, the relation between full amplitude pulsators, low amplitude pulsators, and nonvarinble stars, and the distribution of the masses of the secondaries. The stars in this proposal include four stars with periods longer than 10 days, which will triple the number available. In this project, we request improved low resolution spectra of stars for which only very weak spectra exist. This is particularly important since some companions are chemically peculiar stars, which are dubious objects on which to base a calibration. These can be better recognized oil well-exposed spectra.  A secondary aim of the proposal is to obtain low dispersion spectra. of two double mode pulsators. Although the spectra and photometry of these stars in the visible region are very similar to those of singly excited stars, the ultraviolet flux in the double mode pulsators is unexpectedly high. One possibility is that they have a different surface gravity. We request good spectra of TU Cas and CO Aur to explore this possibility. Finally, we would like to take spectra of Polaris since it is unique in having declined in amplitude by a factor of three since early epoch IUE spectra.|Y
DCOHB|White-Dwarf Companions of Dwarf Carbon Stars|Howard E.|Bond|STScI|In mid-1991 three new members of the class of dwarf carbon stars were discovered, bringing the total number now known to four. These objects have the temperatures and luminosities of K-M dwarfs, but are true carbon stars with strong C2 bands in their optical spectra. The only straightforward way to understand them is if they are members of binary systems in which the former primary became a carbon star on the asymptotic giant branch, transferred nuclearly processed material to the dM secondary, and then became a white dwarf itself.  We will attempt to detect the expected white-dwarf companions of the three new dwarf carbon stars, using IUE in the long-wavelength ultraviolet region. We show that IUE can easily detect such companions down to effective temperatures near 9000 K, and with difficulty down to ~7000 K, corresponding to white dwarfs with cooling ages of 1 to a few Gyr. Detections and/or upper limits on the temperatures of such companions will place interesting constraints on the evolution of these extraordinary objects.|Y
DCPCI|Star Formation in the Taurus-Auriga Dark Clouds|Catherine L.|Imhoff|CSC - Astronomy Programs|The era of space astronomy has given researchers new insight into pre-main sequence evolution. IUE, Einstein, and IRAS have already revolutionized this topic by identification of new classes of PMS stars and by yielding detailed information on chromospheres, coronae, winds, and disks. One approach to understanding PMS evolution involves the detailed study of individual objects; this is the basis of nearly all IUE programs to date. Another approach is to perform a statistical study of a number of stars. This avenue is essential to establish the generality of individual studies, and to find trends and correlations among the stars involving differences in age, angular momentum, mass, and so forth.  The ultraviolet provides essential diagnostics of the chromosphere and transition region and of the accretion disk boundary layer. However, of the various data sets, the IUE data on pre-main sequence stars is the most incomplete (a natural limitation of a pointed instrument). The limitations of the data set, especially the bias toward the brighter, more massive, less typical PMS stars, make the statistical analysis of the IUE data difficult.  We propose to survey a prototypical low-mass star-formation region, the Taurus-Auriga dark clouds, with IUE. We find that it is feasible to obtain IUE data down to specific limiting magnitudes for the various classes of objects (T Tauri stars, "weak" T Tauri stars, SU Aurigae stars, Herbig Ae/Be stars). Doing so would result in a substantial improvement in the data set for this region. The data would include Mg II fluxes, long-wavelength UV "continuum" spectra, and far-ultraviolet emission-line fluxes in order to study chromospheric emission, winds, and disks, either active or passive. New and archival IUE data will be combined with satellite and ground-based data at all wavelength regimes for statistical analysis. We will examine the indicators of various phenomena (chromospheres winds, disks), study their occurence in the various classes of pre-main sequence stars in Taurus-Auriga, correlate them when possible to luminosity, spectral type, mass, or rotation, and determine how these phenomena influence or are influenced by this phase of stellar evolution.|Y

DEOGC|Catching It In the Act: Predictable Declines in V854 Centauri|Geoffrey C.|Clayton|Colorado - CASA|The R CrB star, V854 Cen has been found to decline only at pulsational phase 0.0. This fact combined with the exceptional number of declines seen in this star, makes it likely that observations can be planned of the pre- decline and early decline spectrum of an R CrB star. These observations do not exist because of the unpredictability and rarity of R CrB declines. These observations will enable us to study for the first time: 1) Spectral changes at the time of dust formation which will provide clues to the dust formation process. 2) The inner chromospheric region. The earliest a star has been observed in decline with IUE is 16 days. By this time the accelerating expanding dust cloud has grown to eclipse the inner chromosphere.  These data can provide direct tests of models of chromospheres around supergiants. Empirical arguments based on a large set of observations indicate that dust forms near the star (Clayton et al. 1992a). With this constraint and the known velocities of expansion, we can estimate the absolute extent of different regions in the chromosphere. We will take model chromospheres and calculate the emission in eclipse situations similar to the R CrB stars. These will be compared to the spectra obtained of V854 Cen.|Y

DERDC|Reflection Nebulae as Probes of Dust Extinction in Starburst Galaxies|Daniella|Calzetti|STScI|We propose to observe extended galactic reflection nebulae to study the integrated properties of absorption and scattering of starlight by dust. We will sample representative regions at different surface brightness in each nebula, to understand how the average extinction law changes in the presence of scattered light in different regions of star formation within our Galaxy.  Our aim is to explain the observed absence of the 2175 A absorption feature in the extinction curve of external starburst galaxies. To this purpose, we want to measure the weakening of the 2175 A dust feature in the Milky-Way extinction curve due to the scattering of light into the line of sight across galactic star formation regions. We need spatial coverage of representative (large) fractions of such regions, because the extinction curve in external starburst galaxies has been determined from IUE spectra which include large portions of the galaxies themselves; therefore the simple comparison with the Milky Way extinction curve, derived so far from pure stellar spectra, is not informative. Scattering of starlight by dust is known to fill in the 2175 A absorption. A quantitative measurement of this effect in different objects within the Milky Way may be the only key to understand differences between extinction curves of our own and external galaxies, and in particular if such differences can be attributed to variations in the dust composition.  IUE is the only instrument adequate for this investigation, thanks to its large entrance aperture. We have drawn as much as possible from the IUE archive to prepare this project.|Y

DGJTT|Bimodal Star Formation in Blue Compact Dwarf Galaxies|Trinh X.|Thuan|Virginia|Blue compact dwarf (BCD) galaxies represent, par excellence, the ideal laboratory to study modes of star formation other than density-wave triggered starformation because their small masses cannot sustain density-waves. IUE in its past years of operation has already accumulated a wealth of data on the ultraviolet properties of BCDs, but for the majority of the BCDs which have been studied, only short wavelength (1200-2000 R) spectra exist. We propose here to obtain the complementary long wavelength (2000-3000 A) spectra. This is needed to perform the ultraviolet spectral synthesis of the sample of BCDs which already possess good signal-to-noise short wavelength spectra. While SWP spectra provide information on the OB young stellar populations, i.e. on the 120 to 4 M[sun] mass range, LWP spectra put constraints on the AFG stellar populations, i.e. on the 4 to 1 M[sun] mass range, and provide the missing link between the ultraviolet SWP spectra and the optical spectra which exist for most of the BCDs. The optical and ultraviolet data can put constraints on the star formation history of BCDs as characterized by the Initial Mass Function (IMF), the star formation rate, the age or duration of the burst of star formation and the number of bursts before the present one. One question of particular interest is whether the IMF is truncated at the low mass end (~ 4M[sun]; the LWP spectra are particularly useful for this purpose) implying perhaps bimodal star formation in some BCDs.|Y

DLOGM|Mass Flow in the Interacting Semi-Detached Binary Delta Librae|George E.|McCluskey|Lehigh University|We will use the IUE to probe the physical conditions in the interacting Algol-type system Delta Librae. This system is amazingly similar to U Cep, which is thought to be at the end of the very rapid supercritical mass flow stage. So far, only four (4) stars are thought to be in, or near, this stage of evolution. IUE observations of Delta Librae would expand the present observational evolutionary sequence for stars in this stage. A few IUE observations of Delta Librae have shown Si IV and C IV resonance lines in absorption with phase dependent variations, indicative of accretion processes and the existence of regions considerably hotter than implied by the AO V primary. This system is now in a state of mass flow and accretion. Delta Librae is bright and provides a rare opportunity to obtain high resolution IUE data of an active Algol system with high phase resolution. Observing this system during seven consecutive US2 shifts will yield complete phase coverage spread over three consecutive orbits and will provide an excellent opportunity to analyze the phase dependence of the accretion and mass flow processes in this active system. This will allow us to determine: (a.) if accretion is actually occurring, (b.) if so, the physical parameters of the accreting region, be it a disk or more amorphous extended region, and (c.) provide data on what conditions accretion disks may be formed.|Y
DMEJL|High Dispersion SWP Spectra of Two DME Stars|Jeffrey L.|Linsky|Colorado|Low dispersion SWP spectra of AU Mic (dM2.5e) and AT Mic (dM4.5e+dM4.5e) indicate that these two M dwarfs likely have the brightest emission lines in the ultraviolet, and that it is feasible to obtain line profiles for lines of C II, Si IV, C IV, He II, and Si II in 8 hour SWP high dispersion spectra. We propose to extend our previous studies of dMe stars and high resolution studies of some 15 late-type dwarfs and luminous stars to include AU Mic and AT Mic. Our objectives are (1) to obtain widths of chromospheric and transition region lines for comparison with our previous observations of 5 GO-K2 dwarfs, and to determine the increase in turbulence with height in the atmosphere so as to constrain models of atmospheric heating, (2) to determine which lines are optically thick for comparison with computed model atmospheres, (3) to determine the flux and formation mechanism of the blended He II 1640 multiplet so as to derive the coronal soft X-ray radiation field, and (4) to compute models for the chromospheres and transition regions of these stars. In computing these models we will use fluxes and profiles (when available) for lines of Mg II, C II-IV, Si II-IV, and N V using computer codes that have already been written.|Y
DMHJL|Magnetic Activity in Very Late M Dwarfs: Enhanced or Reduced?|Jeffrey L.|Linsky|Colorado - JILA|The degree of magnetic activity on very late M dwarfs (roughly dM5 and later) is currently very uncertain. This is because there is very little data, and because the few observations that do exist are contradictory. Optical observations suggest both enhanced and reduced levels of chromospheric activity. An apparent drop-off in coronal heating for stars cooler than B-V - 1.7 (spectral type M4-M5) largely disappears if the quantity Lx/Lbol is considered, rather than Lx. Since stars this late are believed to be fully convective, and since many theoretical solar and stellar dynamo models postulate magnetic flux generation or amplification at the base of the convective zone, a reduction in all magnetically induced phenomena might be expected.  Low dispersion, short wavelength IUE observations of the transition region lines of eight nearby, very late, single M dwarfs represents perhaps the most efficient way to resolve this uncertainty. This study extends previous survey work on M dwarfs to the coolest spectral types. Except for the particularly active late M stars Prox Cen and UV Cet, there are no short wavelength IUE observations in this part of the HR diagram.|Y
DMHJR|Active Sectors of YY Gem|John C.|Raymond|CFA|The dM1e binary YY Gem has a well defined, stable structure of large scale active sectors.

DMIJL|Coordinated Observations of Stellar Flares|Jeffrey L.|Linsky|Colorado - JILA|We propose to make coordinated time-resolved IUE, EXOSAT, and ground-based observations of dMe flare stars to investigate the spectral distribution of stellar flare energy, simultaneously over a wide range of wavelengths, from Xrays to microwaves. Recent successful results strongly motivate our present proposal. In fact, the unique character of each of the observed flares and the fortunate circumstance of fully operative IUE and EXOSAT satellites in 1986 give a particularly strong reason for additional time-resolved multiband data on stellar flares at this time. Although time resolved observations in several bandpasses exist for a very small number of flares, no flare has been observed simultaneously from X-rays to microwaves. We propose to monitor one to two of the most active stars among those in the target list, so that the detection of major flares is highly probable.  Spectra from quiescent phases will be co-added to obtain low-noise spectra of faint transition region and coronal lines to model outer atmospheric layers. Pure flare spectra will be extracted by subtracting the average quiescent spectrum from those at active phases.  Several important issues will be addressed, such as the applicability of loop model structure, the energy deposition in the different atmospheric layers, the nature of flare continua, and the extent of the similarity of solar and stellar flares.|Y

The combination of the IUE data-set we propose herein to obtain and the previously acquired X-ray data-set (Bookbinder 1985) will yield further insights on the nature of chromospheric and coronal heating in the ordinary, inactive (quiescent) dM stars. In particular, if the X-ray heating hypothesis for the source of chromospheric heating in the dMe stars, as advanced by Cram (1982), is also applicable to the dM stars then we would expect to find a linear correlation between the luminosity in the Mg II lines and the X-ray luminosity. In general, if a common source of in situ heating in the chromospheres and coronae of the dM stars is present then we would expect to find a linear relationship between the observed Mg II emission and the X-ray emission. Conversely, if the sources of chromospheric and coronal heating are different between these atmospheric regions in the dM stars then we expect to find a departure from a simple linear relationship. The results to be obtained in this program will yield critical observational constraints on the possible mechanisms for atmospheric heating in the dM stars.|Y
DMMSS|Studies of Intermediate Activity M Dwarfs|Steven H.|Saar|Harvard SAO - CFA|Recent optical spectroscopic surveys of dwarf M stars have resulted in the discovery of a number of objects with intermediate activity levels (H-alpha in weak emission). Available optical data suggest these stars have a level of chromospheric activity (and perhaps an evolutionary status) midway between active BY Dra stars and quiet dM's. These "marginal" BY Dra stars are single objects whose rotation velocities parallel their chromospheric activity, i.e., higher than those of quiet dM stars but below that of active BY Dra objects. The marginal BY Dra stars provide us with a class of objects rotating very near a "trigger velocity" (believed to be 5 km s^-1) which appears to divide active BY Dra stars from quiet dM's. As only four "marginal" BY Dra stars have been observed in the UV to date, we propose to considerably enlarge the UV database for these objects. UV data on Mg II emission fluxes and strength of transition region features such as C IV will serve to fix activity levels in the marginal objects and determine chromosphere and transition-region heating rates. Simultaneous optical magnetic field measures will be used to explore the connection between field-strength/filling-factor and atmospheric heating. Comparison of these data with published information on active and quiet dM stars will yield information on the character of the stellar dynamo as it makes a transition from "low" to "high" activity.|Y
DMNDB|Detection of Tau Neutrino Decay Photons|David|Burstein|Arizona State University|Sciama has proposed that the tau neutrino has a mass of 29  1 eV, and decays with a lifetime of -- 2 X 10^23 sec into a photon of 14.5  0.5 eV and a muon neutrino. Sufficient numbers of tau neutrinos are created in the big bang that, if Sciama is correct, the tau neutrino provides enough mass for the universe to attain critical density (Omega = 1.0). The decay photon of the tau neutrino would be the dominant source of hydrogen ionizing flux in the universe and, in that role, can explain a number of otherwise unrelated astronomical phenomena. These photons can be detected by IUE, and we propose to search for their existence in the centers of dense clusters. Our observations will either detect, or place strong upper limits, on the existence of this decay photon. Due to various observing constraints, we intend to observe the high density centers of high redshift (z >= 0.52) clusters to maximize our chances of detection. Either detected, or undetected, these observations will make IUE one of the most sensitive dark matter particle detectors in existence!|Y
DNLCM|Observations of U Gem in Outburst|Christopher W.|Mauche|Los Alamos|We propose to observe the dwarf nova U Gem throughout a single outburst to study the evolution of its flux distribution and the evolution of the P Cygni profiles of its ultraviolet resonance lines. These observations will allow a study of the parameters characterizing the disk instability and mass-transfer instability models of its dwarf nova outbursts and the mass-loss rate and ionization state of its wind. In addition to the proposed IUE low-resolution short- and longwavelength spectra, we have made plans to obtain simultaneous far-ultraviolet Voyager UVS spectra, optical photometry and spectroscopy, and plan to seek approval for target of opportunity observations of U Gem in the X-ray regime with the Ginga satellite. Also, we propose to obtain I high-resolution SWP spectrum of U Gem at the peak of its outburst to study (1) possible narrow wind features, (2) possible narrow circumstellar or interstellar highexcitation absorption features, (3) the three-dimensional density structure of the local interstellar medium, (4) the filling factor of clouds in the local interstellar medium, (5) the depletion of silicon and iron from the gas phase of the local interstellar medium, and (6) the column density of neutral hydrogen to this cataclysmic variable.|Y
DNLRP|Slow Rise Symmetrical Outbursts in SS Cyg|Ronald S.|Polidan|Arizona|We propose to obtain observations of a symmetrical outburst in the dwarf nova SS Cygni. The objective of this study is to obtain complete coverage of a symmetrical outburst in SS Cyg giving precise spectrophotometric information that would be of great use to disk modelers. In the extensive archive of IUE observations of SS Cyg only two images (one SWP and one LWR) were obtained during a symmetrical outburst. These data when compared to the asymmetrical outburst data strongly suggest that the evolution of the symmetrical outbursts is radically different than that of the asymmetrical outbursts. Symmetrical outbursts occur in other dwarf novae but there is a significant advantage, from the standpoint of theoretical modeling, to have both asymmetrical and symmetrical outbursts in the same system. The asymmetrical outburst data exists for SS Cyg, we propose to obtain the symmetrical outburst data. With these data we may be able to distinguish between the two competing models for the origin of dwarf novae outbursts.|Y

DNOCM|Orbital Coverage of Dwarf Novae in the Ultraviolet|Cathy S.|Mansperger|CSC - IUE Observatory|Five dwarf novae with short orbital periods and short outburst cycles have been chosen. These targets are all available to IUE at the same time. For this program each object will be observed once a day with the SWP camera for five days in a row. This will provide nearly complete orbital coverage for all of these systems. Obtaining this coverage will lead to a better understanding of the physical characteristics of each of these systems. If any of these dwarf novae are due for an outburst they will also be monitored to determine if there is any evidence of the preoutburst stage in the ultraviolet. Two alternate targets have been chosen as well in case the program can not be scheduled at the time when all of the primary targets are available.|Y
DNOLW|Dust Nucleation and Mass Loss in Miras - L2 Puppis and V CVn|Lee Anne|Willson|Iowa State University|Mira variables typically show highly phase-dependent and wavelength dependent linear polarization of the order of 1-3%, usually explained as the result of scattering by dust or molecules deep in the atmosphere. But the Miralike SR variables L2 Pup and V CVn show linear polarization up to 8%, much higher than can be accounted for by such scattering alone. Furthermore, L2 Pup's light curve and polarization change on timescales of tens of cycles, as dust grains grow and are ejected. Electron scattering could play an important role in producing the phasedependent polarization in these stars; the scattering electrons would be either in the ionized post-shock material that produces H Balmer and MgII emission, or in a shock-heated region in the extended stellar atmosphere. With simultaneous monitoring of the polarization; the II Balmer and MgII emission; and using detailed model calculations to interpret the observations, we expect to be able to determine the origin and nature of the observed polarization.  We have already detected an apparent dust formation episode in L2 PUP (Brugel et al. 1991) through the long term monitoring of this object. We propose to continue investigating the time evolution of this phenomenon as L2 Pup changes from cycle to cycle. We also propose to initiate a monitoring program for V CVn, which is a similar object to L2 Pup but has not been extensively studied in the ultraviolet and for "simultaneous" polarization. MgII is a powerful probe of the ionization structure and shock development in these stars; thus the proposed IUE observations are most critical to the success of this project.|Y
DNPPS|Target of Opportunity: Humps in V503 Cyg|Paula|Szkody|U Washington|We will use IUE in a Target of Opportunity mode to obtain time-resolved spectra of V503 Cyg during an outburst. Optical photometry and spectroscopy of this unusual dwarf nova has shown the presence of one magnitude continuum humps that repeat on a period a few percent longer than that derived from the emission line fluxes and velocities. We will use the known presence of humps at outburst to investigate the hump temperature and location and the overall disk structure in relation to that known for other ultrashort period dwarf novae at outburst and superoutburst to determine if the humps are related to superhump phenomena in eccentric disks, to accretion phenomena in magnetic systems, or to irradiation effects on the secondary star.|Y

DPKDM|Dust Above the Galactic Plane|Derck L.|Massa|ARC|we are requesting 5 US2 shifts for the purpose of studying the Uv extinction properties of interstellar dust located above the galactic plane. We present both theoretical and observational evidence which leads us to suspect that the properties of this dust are significantly different from dust in the galactic plane. By studying how the differences in the observed extinction depend on galactic altitude, IzI, we can determine how the particle size distribution of dust grains changes with |z|. This, in turn, will provide clues concerning the physical processes responsible for maintaining this dust layer.|Y

DSERP|UV Variability of Delta Scuti Stars|Robert J.|Panek|CSC|While the delta Scuti stars are generally understood as pulsating variables driven by Cepheid-type instabilities, little is certain of the details of the pulsations for any individual stars or for the objects as a whole. Basic questions, such as the modes of pulsation for individual stars, or what provokes the diversity of objects in the class, remain to be settled. Our goal is to determine the physical changes induced by the pulsations. Ultraviolet studies offer important advantages in the characterization of thermal, atmospheric, and shockwave effects. We propose to use one shift to study a radial pulsator, where the physical effects of the pulsation can be straightforwardly determined. We propose to use an additional shift to study a nonradial pulsator with a more complex light curve. Both stars will be monitored over one cycle with a technique which permits low dispersion spectra to be obtained on both cameras every 30 minutes. Another cycle will be covered with LWR high dispersion. The low resolution spectra measure the UV continuum and line blends, and will be analyzed for changes in the atmospheric parameters in conjunction with model stellar atmospheres and standard stellar spectra. The high resolution spectra will measure the profiles of the strong resonance lines, particularly MgII, for a search for chromospheric or shockwave effects.|Y
DSGTA|A Far-Ultraviolet Study of the Bright Delta Scuti Variable Beta Cassiopeia|Thomas R.|Ayres|Colorado-Lasp|Beta Cassiopeiae is a fast rotating early-F subgiant that exhibits smallamplitude pulsations in optical light and radial velocity of the delta Scuti class, and is a bright far-ultraviolet emission-line source having surface fluxes in excess of thirty times those of the quiet Sun. It is plausible that the fast rotation of a Cas, and the recent development of a shallow convection zone as the star has evolved into the blue edge of the Hertzsprung gap, have conspired to produce substantial amounts of surface magnetic activity by means of the dynamo mechanism. The strong chromospheric and higher temperature emissions might then arise from processes analogous to those operating in magnetic "active regions" on the Sun. However, it certainly also is possible that the strong ultraviolet emissions are a byproduct of the delta Sct phenomenon, itself, as in fact has been suggested recently in the case of the Cepheids, which are similar in temperature but more luminous than the delta Scuti stars.  Accordingly, I feel that beta Cas is a worthwhile subject for a detailed study with IUE in order to investigate the properties of its chromospheric and higher -temperature emission lines: High-dispersion, far-ultraviolet measurements of beta Cas would extend previous studies of F-M dwarfs, giants, and supergiants into the earliest spectral types where solar-like chromospheric phenomena have been identified; and IUE is sufficiently sensitive to test the hypothesis of pulsationinduced chromospheric heating, through monitoring of the lowdispersion SWP spectrum of beta Cas over several of the 2^h.4 cycles for evidence of periodic behavior in the far-ultraviolet emissions.|Y
DSJFW|Delta Scuti Stars|Frederick M.|Walter|Colorado - CASA|The late A/early F dwarfs (.27 < B-V < .42) exhibit strong transition region line emission which is not solar-like in character. We have concluded that the atmospheres of these stars are heated mechanically, by acoustic waves generated in a shallow convection zone. Slightly hotter stars exhibit far less emission. Since these stars lie in the delta Scuti instability strip, although none are known pulsators, we propose to examine the effect of prominent pulsations on the heating of the atmospheres of these stars. We hope to ascertain whether the delta Scuti pulsations enhance or detract from the mean atmospheric heating levels. The results will help us understand how stellar atmospheres respond to acoustic fluxes and shocks.|Y
DSJTA|Further Studies of Beta Cassiopeiae|Thomas R.|Ayres|Colorado - CASA|In an exploratory IUE program two years ago, one of us (TRA) obtained an intriguing series of far-ultraviolet spectra of beta Cassiopeiae: the nearest and brightest of the delta Scuti variables. On the one hand, a sequence of low-dispersion spectra recorded an abrupt, factorof-two increase in the chromospheric Ly-alpha (1216 A) emission on a timescale comparable to the 2.4-hour pulsation period. This behavior favors a "pulsational" origin for the chromospheric heating as Schmidt and Parsons have suggested for the more luminous Cepheids. On the other hand, the C IV 1548 emission profile, though noisy, exhibits one of the largest velocity widths known among "normal" stars of late spectral type. The enhanced broadening, if due to the rapid rotation of the star, implies that the atmospheric structures which are bright in the C IV emission must reach to considerable heights above the limb of the star. This behavior is more compatible with a conventional magnetic origin for the high excitation emission. In the magnetic picture, the abrupt brightening of the Ly-alpha emission might be due to a stellar "flare", or to the rotation onto the visible hemisphere of a bright "activity center".  The purpose of the present proposal is to collect additional low-dispersion SWP spectra, in conjunction with ground-based Stromgren photometry and high-precision radial-velocity spectroscopy, to monitor beta Cas on both rotational (few days) and pulsational (few hours) timescales. Our objective is to to distinguish among the possible chromospheric energization mechanisms at the important juncture in the H-R diagram represented by early-F stars like beta Cas. We also propose to take a deep high-dispersion SWP exposure to improve the profiles of the C IV features and reach down to weaker emissions like the Si IV doublet near 1400 A, in an effort to study gas-dynamic phenomena in the outer atmosphere of this intensely active delta Sct variable.|Y
DWPSS|Monitoring the Most Massive Stars|Steven N.|Shore|CSC - GHRS|We propose to continueour study of a sample of luminous blue variables (LBVs) and LBV candidates in the Magellanic Clouds and the Galaxy.  The purposes are to study the stability and "microvariability" of these stars in the UV, with luck to catch one or more of these in outburst, and to provide important information on the spectrophotometric behavior on timescales of several years for the most massive stars in their parent galaxies.  The LBVs display violet shell ejection episodes that eject upwards of 10^-2 M(sun)yr^-1 for many years.  They are major sources of nucleosyntheic material (CNO), may play an important role in controlling massive star formation, and they offer sites for fundamental tests of radiative steller wind theory.|Y
DWRSS|Monitoring the Most Massive Stars in the LMC and the Galaxy|Steven N.|Shore|Indiana University - South Bend|We propose to continue our study of a sample of luminous blue variables (LBV) and LBV candidates (LBVc) in the Magellanic Clouds and the Galaxy. The purposes are to study the stability and "microvariability" of these stars in the UV (with luck to catch one or more of these in outburst) and to provide important information on the spectrophotometric and spectroscopic behavior on timescales of several years for the most massive stars in their parent galaxies. We will concentrate on those stars for which a long time history of IUE observations is available, especially the Galactic LBVs AG Car, HR Car, and He3-365, the LMC variables S 22/LMC, S 96/LMC = S Dor, and R143, and the SMC variable S 65/SMC = R50. The LBVs display unpredictable violent mass loss episodes that eject upwards of 0.01 M(sun)/yr for many years. They are major sources of galactic nucleosyntheic material (CNO), may play an important role in controlling massive star formation, and they are fundamental for tests of radiative stellar wind theory. This project will leave a permanent archive for future research and will provide clues for current investigations of the cause and course of the outbursts.|Y

EBHEG|Ultraviolet Observations of Eclipsing Binary Systems with Highly Eccentric Orbits|Edward F.|Guinan|Villanova|In eclipsing binary star systems, the motion of the major axis of the relative orbit of the stars is called apsidal motion. There are two contributions to this motion: 1) The stars are not point masses. There are deformations of the stars due to their intrinsic rotation , and there are deformations caused by their mutual tidal forces. These two effects provide for the classical components of apsidal motion. 2) General Relativity predicts that the line of apse should also advance due to the nature of gravity - that distortion in space and time caused by the presence of the mass of the stars. In almost every case, the classical effects overwhelmingly dominate, and it is not possible to adequately test the accuracy or validity of the relativistic component. There are however, the highly eccentric binary system DI Herculis and V541 Cygni. Because of the large masses of the stars and their highly elccentric orbits , their relativistic contributions are respectively, 1.2 and 2.2, times greater than their classical contributions.  In both cases, the observed apsidal motion is significantly smaller than the combined theoretically expected motion. DI Her is unique in that its orbital and stellar parameters are extremely well defined, thus there can be no error in the determination of the theoretically expected motion. Thus we are confronted with either an undiscovered ( or misunderstood ) classical effectc(s) operating in these binary systems , or a serious inconsistency with General Relativity. Before challenging G R, however, we wish to exhaust all possible classical effects (a third component in the systems, circumbinary clouds or stellar winds, or stellar pulsations) which have presently eluded us in our analysis of the Visual spectral signatures, by a careful examination of any evidence of these effects in the ultraviolet .|Y
EBHJL|The Unique Eclipsing Binary System TZ Fornacis|Jeffrey L.|Linsky|Colorado - JILA|TZ For (G5III+F7III) is the only known eclipsing binary system consisting of two late-type giants. Accordingly, the stellar parameters can be determined very accurately, especially the stellar masses and the evolutionary state. As in the similar but non-eclipsing Capella system, the secondary is a rapidly rotating star.  We propose to observe TZ For (with LWP-HI and SWP-LO exposures) at opposite quadratures (phases 0.25, 0.75) and during primary eclipse (phase 0.) when almost half of the F giant is occulted. These observations will permit us to (i) disentangle the UV emission contributions from each star, (ii) study for the first time the surface distribution of emission on a giant star, (iii) investigate time variability, and (iv) model the atmosphere of the active star. Comparing these results with those for Capella will be very instructive, since the F9III star in Capella might be atypical in the steadiness of its (high) level of chromospheric and transition region flux.|Y
EBKRP|High Ionization Emission Lines in V356 SGR|Ronald S.|Polidan|Arizona|It is proposed that a series of time resolved, high dispersion SWP exposures be obtained of the binary star V356 Sgr during the system eclipse. These observations will be used to study the high ionization absorption and emission lines seen in the spectrum. A poorly exposed high dispersion image obtained in March, 1987 showed these lines to be exceedingly broad: FWHM ~ 1000 km s^-1. Observations will be obtained during the ingress and egress phases and during totality. Line profile and strength analyses of Si III 1206, N V 1240, and Si IV 1400 will be used to determine if these lines are formed in a single (reasonably) uniform region or in multiple or stratified regions and the relationship between the absorption and emission lines. In addition to studies of the resonance lines, the Si III subordinate lines near 1300 A will be analyzed using a 12 level, collisional- radiative equilibrium atomic model developed for silicon ion species. This analysis should give reliable electron temperatures and densities for the Si III line formation region. Results from these analyses will be compared with predictions from theoretical model calculations.|Y
EBKTA|Atmospheric Eclipsing Binaries: Tau Per|Thomas B.|Ake|CSC|Follow up observations are proposed of the binary system tau Per, which we have reported to be another possible zeta Aur-like eclipsing system (Ake et al 1086). This is the third such system discovered with IUE. The primary is a G51II star with a 4.15 year spectroscopic orbit, while the secondary appears to be a normal A2 main sequence star. An astrometric orbit from speckleinterferometric observations has been determined by McAlister (1981). Eclipse observations so far cover only 2 partial phases and show a curious wavelength dependence unlike the other zeta Aur systems and much like the peculiar binary eps Aur, where the eclipse depth increases with decreasing wavelength to ~ 1600 and then becomes shallower down to ~ 1200. As in systems of this type, strong absorption lines in the far and mid-UV are seen superimposed on the secondary's spectrum during these phases. Further UV observations are needed at various times near eclipse to map out the extent and homogeneity of this material and investigate the wavelength dependent nature of the eclipse.|Y
EBLES|Observations of V471 Tauri at Critical Phases|Edward M.|Sion|Villanova|Our high resolution IUE investigation of the Hyades pre-cataclysmic, eclipsingspectroscopic (K2V + DA2) binary V471 Tauri has revealed (1) a stellar wind emanating from the K2V star with a mass loss rate of  2 x 10-11 M[sun]/yr, the first to be detected from any late type dwarf other than the sun (Mullan et al 1989); (2) evidence of a cool, expanding circumbinary shell at -1200 km/s which may be the remnant of an ancient nova (Si-on et al 1989) and (3) redshifted velocity components at +350 km/s -850 km/s and +1200 to +1500 km/s, all of Which persist from image to image and may represent accretion flows onto the white dwarf. We still lack and critically need high resolution coverage at certain key orbital phases (between 0.0 - 0.25 and between 0.8 - 1.00 ; see fig.-! in section I-) in order to (1) complete our study of the complex longward-shifted features which appear to be due to wind streaming toward the white dwarf or infall (accretion flows?) and (2) to confirm the deep P Cygnilike absorptions at primary eclipse when the white dwarf is behind the K2 dwarf for most of the exposure and we are seeing wind outflow from the side of the K2 dwarf that is not being irradiated by the white dwarf.|Y
EBMJS|Discrete Absorption Components and Dynamics of Eclipsing Binaries|Jorge|Sahade|Argentina|The goals of this proposal are (1) to investigate closely for two well-selected early-type star binaries (mu^1 Sco and AO Cas) the behavior of the discrete absorption components as a function of binary phase, and (2) to study the phase-dependent wind-wind collision effects. The proposed investigation is another step in the analysis of the variable wind properties and stellar wind structure in early-type stars.|Y
EBMTA|The Eclipse of Gamma Persei|Thomas B.|Ake|CSC - GHRS|IUE observations are proposed for the 14.6 year binary system tau Per, which may be another zeta Aur-like eclipsing system. Optically this object is classified as a G8III + A3 system, although we find the IUE data indicates that the secondary is of earlier type, Al. An astrometric orbit from speckle-interferometric observations has been determined by McAlister (1982), and coupled with the spectroscopic orbit, Popper and McAlister (1987) find the inclination to be near 90' and predict an atmospheric eclipse to occur in November 1990. The components of the system also appear to be overluminous and cannot be fit simultaneously to evolutionary tracks appropriate for their masses. Based on its similarity to the eclipsing systern tau Per, we expect the eclipse to show a curious wavelength dependence unlike the other zeta Aur systems and much like the peculiar binary epsilon Aur, where the eclipse depth increases with decreasing wavelength to ~ 1600 and then becomes shallower down to ~ 1200. As in systems of this type, strong absorption lines in the far and mid-UV should be seen superimposed on the secondary's spectrum during these phases. UV observations are needed at various times near eclipse to map out the extent and homogeneity of mass flow from the primary star and investigate the wavelength dependent nature of the eclipse. Of the other zeta Aur-like systems, tau Per will join 22 Vul, HR 2554, and tau Per as the only ones with primaries of G-type.|Y
EBMTM|The Ultraviolet Flux from the Eclipsing Binary, PG1550+131|Thomas R.|Marsh|STScI|The star PG1550+131 has recently been found to show eclipses on a period of 3.12 hours, close to the upper edge of the gap in the orbital period distribution of cataclysmic variable stars (CVs). Remarkably for its short orbital period, PG1550+131 shows no evidence of any mass transfer, with the very deep and rapid eclipse indicating that all the light near eclipse comes from a white dwarf star. PG1550+131 may thus be either a precursor to a CV or a CV that has become detached, as is believed to occur when a CV enters the period gap.  Optical photometry shows a 0.6 mag. "reflection" effect as we see the reprocessed light from the heated face of the companion to the white dwarf. Such a strong modulation requires a large amount of ultraviolet flux from the white dwarf since only a few percent of the total can be intercepted by its companion. Thus study of the ultraviolet flux in this system is crucial to an understanding of its photometric behaviour.  Our objective is to take low resolution IUE spectra of PG1550+131 in order to measure the ultraviolet flux and temperature of the white dwarf. These data will allow us to measure how close the system is to a semi-detached configuration.|Y
EBPEG|Eclipsing Binaries in the Magellanic Clouds: Fundamental Properties and Distances|Edward F.|Guinan|Villanova University|We propose to obtain IUE spectra of five OB eclipsing binaries in the Magellanic clouds which have the best determined light and radial velocity curves. Since these stars radiate most of their energy in the UV, the character of the UV continuum and the presence of highly ionized elements are sensitive measures of stellar temperatures. These spectra will be fit to the most recent version (ATLAS12) of Kurucz models to obtain accurate temperatures and interstellar absorption. These data, when combined with values for the masses and radii obtained from ground-based light and radial velocity curves, will provide us with accurate stellar luminosities. This leads to the first Mass-Luminosity relationship, using directly measured masses and luminosities, for stars outside the Milky Way, and extends the parameter space in stellar interior models to chemical compositions different from the Milky Way. These eclipsing binaries can also serve as first-class standard candles. Because the uncertainty in the ground-based determination of their temperatures presently contributes the greatest uncertainty in their computed distances, the more precise temperatures obtained from IUE spectra, combined with the well-determined stellar radii, will allow us to compute the distance moduli to these stars to within  0.15 mag.|Y
EBPTS|Timing the Eclipse of HD 185510|Theodore|Simon|U Hawaii|HD 185510 is an RS CVn binary containing a K0 III/IV primary and a hot subdwarf secondary which is totally eclipsed every 21 days. The nature of the secondary was discovered with IUE, and subsequent IUE observations determined the mass ratio to be very large (Mp / Ms = 7.45 +/- 0. 15). The inclination and stellar masses may be measured to an accuracy that is limited only by the eclipse geometry, which is currently poorly known. By using IUE to obtain a UV light curve with a time resolution of ~5 minutes, we will be able to measure the subdwarf mass to an accuracy of 0.01 M(sun), and test whether it is a helium main sequence object or not.|Y
EBQEG|Eclipsing Binaries in the Magellanic Clouds: Fundamental Properties and Distances|Edward|Guinan|Villanova University|We propose to continue our 16th IUE episode program of studying extragalactic binaries. We plan to obtain IUE spectra of eight additional OB eclipsing binaries in the Magellanic clouds which have well determined light and radial velocity curves. Since these stars radiate most of their energy in the UV, the character of the UV continuum and the presence of highly ionized elements are sensitive measures of stellar temperatures. These spectra will be fit to the most recent version (ATLAS13) of Kurucz models to obtain accurate temperatures and interstellar absorption. These data, when combined with values for the masses and radii obtained from ground-based light and radial velocity curves, will provide us with accurate stellar luminosities. This leads to the first Mass-Luminosity relationship, using directly measured masses and luminosities, for stars outside the Milky Way, and extends the parameter space in stellar interior models to chemical compositions different from the Milky Way. These eclipsing binaries can also serve as first-class standard candles. Because the uncertainty in the ground-based determination of their temperatures presently contributes the greatest uncertainty in their computed distances, the more precise temperatures obtained from IUE spectra, combined with the well-determined stellar radii, will allow us to compute the distance moduli to these stars to within +/- 0.15 mag.|Y

ECHJL|A Long Look at Zeta Aurigae During Total Eclipse|Jeffrey L.|Linsky|Colorado - JILA|We propose to observe the eclipsing binary system Zeta Aurigae (K41b-II + B8V) during the total eclipse of its hotter component in April 1985 and thereby study the density, temperature, and geometric extent of the K-star chromosphere. The primary data for this analysis will be a long-duration (~12 hour) LWP high resolution spectrum that will properly record the intercombination lines of C II multiplet UV 0.01 near 2325 A. Fe II fluorescent lines near 2508 A will also be analyzed to provide an estimate of the star's Ly-alpha flux. Other Fe II lines throughout the LWP wavelength range will be modelled to provide additional information on the characteristics of the chromosphere of the cool, luminous component of the Zeta Aurigae system.|Y
ECJMK|IUE Observations of the Cooling Flow in the Cluster A1795|Minas C.|Kafatos|George Mason University|Recent H-alpha emission line imagery of X-ray emitting clusters of galaxies has revealed large, bright gaseous condensations in the cooling flows of the central regions of several clusters. We observed diffuse ultraviolet emission from the cooling flow in the cluster A1795, amounting to an observed Ly-alpha flux of ~ 4 x 10^14 erg cm^-2 s^-1.  We propose to carry out LWP observations of the same cooling flow in A1795 as well as LWP observations of the central cD galaxy. Such observations will be useful to pinpoint the physical characteristics of the diffuse Ly-alpha emitting region and the mechanism of ionization and heating. Our sophisticated three-dimensional surface map techniques will allow us to detect MgII more easily than our already detected Ly-alpha emission.|Y
ECRPB|Probing an Expanding Shock Wave in Eta Carinae with IUE: The Final Chapter|Patricia|Boyd|USRA|The IUE can probe the physics of the central region of eta Carinae. The UV 191 multiplet of Fe II arises from a high level in the Fe II ion and can only be formed in a high temperature region. In the spectra of eta Car's central region, we see strong UV 191 Fe II emission. Using IUE archival data we have determined that there is an expanding hot region, possibly a shock front, in the central region of the eta Car nebula. There are also indications of structure within some spectral lines, suggesting a complex velocity field. It is our goal to extend the IUE archive to determine the current status of the expanding region and with co-added spectra achieve higher signal-to-noise data, resolving the issue of underlying velocity structure. Finally, the IUE archival information on this bizarre object, fascinating to researchers in numerous subfields, will be greatly improved with the addition of high S/N, well spaced, optimally exposed spectra of the central region.|Y

We wish to investigate whether these objects are related in the sense that they are simply collections of hot stars and ionized gas or whether some systems are fundamentally different. Possible abundance anomalies and the gas-to-dust ratio will also be investigated. Ultraviolet data will be analyzed with existing population-synthesis computer programs utilizing a linear-programming technique to calculate the stellar content. An evolutionary code which computes the relative population of the H-R diagram by assuming an initial mass function and an exponential star formation rate will be used to explore the evolutionary histories of these objects.|Y

Answers to the following questions are sought: 1) What is the shape of the continuum and what are the implications for the stellar initial mass function? 2) Are any absorption lines in the atmospheres of the hot stars visible? 3) Which emission lines are important and what is the structure of the Lyman alpha line, in particular? 4) What ultraviolet features of young stellar populations are clearly different from known ultraviolet features of quasars? Answers to the last question should aid future searches for young galaxies at high redshifts.|Y
EGBGW|Ultraviolet Observations of Nearby Early-Type Galaxies|G.

Simple stellar population models will be used to interpret the data. The necessary integration times are difficult to estimate, but are expected to be very long.|Y

EGBMP|Physical Conditions in Nuclei of Normal Galaxies and in     Extragalactic H II Regions|M.|Peimbert|Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico|From the observations of C II, C III and C IV emission lines in the UV we would like to determine the relative importance of collisional to radiative ionization in the nuclei of normal galaxies like M51 and M81 and from this result the abundances of C, N, O, Ne and S relative to those of H. We would also like to determine the carbon abundance gradient in M101 and the carbon abundances in very bright H II regions of the local group (LMC, SMC and M33). These observations will be a powerful tool to study the chemical evolution of galaxies. The C/H ratio is proportional to the CO/H2 ratio and consequently it is very important for obtaining the total amount of molecular hydrogen from CO observations, We already have excellent observations in the 3400-7400 A region for most of these objects.|Y

EGCJC|The Stellar Population of Normal Galaxies|Judith G.|Cohen|CIT|We propose to observe at low resolution the nuclei of normal galaxies to derive information on the stellar population. By combining IUE observations with optical and infrared spectrophotmetry, we hope to model the stellar content of galactic nuclei based on the components normally seen in the old stellar population of galactic globular clusters. We shall use our observationally calibrated theoretical models to predict ultraviolet fluxes expected from stars present in old stellar populations, and thus to set limits on the possible presence of young O and B stars. Our models can successfully reproduce fluxes in globular clusters and in elliptical galaxies from 3500A to 2.4 microns.  Since the nuclei of normal galaxies are rather faint in the ultraviolet, the low resolution mode is required with exposures approaching an entire 8 hour shift necessary in many cases. We therefore request 16 low background shifts and 4 NASA shift 2 sessions.|Y
EGCJH|OB/HII Complexes in External Gagaxies|J. K.|Hill|Systems and Applied Sciences|Variations in the history of nucleosynthesis with position in external galaxies have been studied optically by determining the gas phase abundances of the heavy elements 0, N, S and Ne in HII regions at various distances from the nucleus. We propose to extend these observations by using the IUE to determine the C/O ratio and the ultraviolet extinction curve in about 40 OB/HII complexes in M33, M51, and M101 which have either been previously observed optically or are prominent on ultraviolet rocket images.|Y
EGCKD|Observations of Dwarf Emission-Line Galaxies|Kris|Davidson|Minnesota|We propose to obtain low-dispersion IUE spectra of at least two dwarf emission-line galaxies, which are the sites of star formation with low heavy-element abundances; we propose also to obtain at least a short-wavelength spectrum Of the peculiar galaxy Markarian 359, which resembles a Seyfert "type 1" galaxy but whose peculiarities merit special attention.  For the dwarf emission-line galaxies, we hope thereby to obtain information on the following: (1) Underlying stellar continua. The emission-line regions are thought to be excited by massive--perhaps very massive--hot stars, but there are some difficulties associated with this idea. Hot supergiants may be involved. (2) Emission lines, particularly of carbon. The emission-line regions are known to be hotter than most HII regions in our Galaxy; this favors UV emission lines, compared with visual-wavelength forbidden lines. Among other things, the carbon abundances may be derivable from UV data. (3) Extinction of the continua by dust. Our present estimates of extinction for these objects are based on emission lines; it is possible that the continua are more highly reddened (this would explain some things); the 2200 A feature may be useful in this regard.  For Mkn 359, we are primarily interested in discovering whether its UV emission lines are like those of a Seyfert galaxy or a quasar; if there are differences, these may be suggestive. So far as we know today, Mkn 359 is unique; but other similar objects may be noticed in the future.|Y
EGCMP|Physical Conditions in Nuclei of Galaxies and in Extragalactic H2 Regions|M.|Peimbert|Madrid|Project a) We would like to determine the physical conditions in the nuclei of M51 and M81. We have already obtained LWR IUE and optical data of M81 and find that it shows Seyfert activity at a very low level in its nucleus. The full width at I half maximum of the broad emission lines amounts to ~ 5000 km s^-1 (just like in typical Seyfert galaxies). This nucleus can be classified as Seyfert 1.5. This is the closest Seyfert nucleus (by at least factor of six) in which the high density regions and the central high mass object can be studied. We need a very deep SWP exposure of M81. We would also like to find out if M51 shows a similar behaviour.  Project b) We would like to determine the carbon abundances in very bright metal poor H II regions like NGC 5471 in M101 and NGC 2363 in NGC 2366. We have excellent optical observations of these objects carried out at KPNO that will be used in combination with the IUE data. From our previous run we have found that the carbon emission lines are detectable in metal poor H II regions but that they are too faint and the dust scattered continuum too bright in H II regions with normal metal abundances, therefore we plan to concentrate in metal poor objects.|Y
EGCTT|Star Formation in Blue Compact Dwarf Galaxies|Trinh X.|Thuan|Virginia|Seven sessions of eight hours each during the low background shift are requested to obtain low resolution spectra with both the short and long wavelength cameras of nine blue compact dwarf galaxies (BCDG) where intense bursts of star formation are believed to occur presently. The ultraviolet observations will complement the optical and HI observations already obtained for these objects in seeking an answer to the following questions: 1) What is the strength of the carbon lines? Carbon and Oxygen are the main cooling agents in these objects.  2) Does the initial mass function (IMF) in the BCDG differ significantly from that in the solar neighborhood? What is the total mass consumption rate, assuming all the gas goes into forming stars? What is the duration T of the bursts of star formation? Is there any correlation between T and the metallicity, the luminosity or the total mass (from the HI width) of the BCDG? 3) what is the range of allowed chemical evolution models for the BCDG? What is the yield in these objects? 4) Can the UV and optical line spectrum be explained by recombination processes? 5) Is the 2200 A feature which measures the amount of internal extinction present? Even partial answers to the above questions will give insights into the burst mode of star formation.|Y
EGDCW|UV Observations of Three S0 Galaxies Suspected to Have Had Recent Star Formation|Chi-Chao|Wu|CSC|We propose to observe three SO galaxies, NGC 5102, VII Zw 421 and II Zw 67, which have been suggested to have undergone recent star formation activity. We wish to establish conclusively the nature of the hot stars in these galaxies by measuring the strength of the N V 1240, Si 1400 and C IV 1550 absorptions which have large equivalent widths in young OB stars. Ultraviolet data will be analyzed with existing population synthesis computer programs utilizing a linearprogramming technique to calculate the stellar content. An evolutionary code which computes the relative population of the H-R diagram by assuming an initial mass function and an exponential star formation rate will be used to explore the evolutionary histories of these objects. K-corrections will be calculated for a composite system which contains a giant elliptical galaxy (e.g. NGC 4472) and different proportions of the stellar population of the SO galaxies. The resulting galaxy colors will be used in an attempt to understand the known high-redshift blue clusters of galaxies and to explore the effects on the redshiftmagnitude diagram if some first-ranked cluster elliptuals have experienced evolutionary histories similar to those of the SO galaxies.|Y

EGDJH|Hot Galaxies with IUE|John P.|Huchra|CFA|We propose IUE observations of blue emission line galaxies that have optical spectra indicating a great deal of recent star formation. Extensive data in the optical, infrared and x-ray is available for most of these galaxies. However, UV spectra are critical for determination of the galaxian stellar content, of the physical conditions in the emission line region, and of the relative contribution to the x-ray emission by OB stars, supernovae remnants and binary x-ray sources. These IUE observations will also place better constraints on evolutionary models of galaxy populations and thus allow a better understanding of the spectra of galaxies observed at high redshifts.|Y
EGEGB|Ultraviolet Spectrum of Spiral Galaxies|Gustavo A.|Bruzual|C.I.D.A.|Spiral galaxies contribute most of the thermal UV light filling the universe However, the detailed shape of the spectrum of these stellar systems in the range from 1300 to 3200 A is not well known. This information is needed for an understanding of distant galaxy spectra, models for faint galaxy counts, models for the spectrum of the extragalactic background light, etc. We propose to obtain low dispersion SWP and LWR spectra of an average region in the disks of M51 and M101, avoiding giant HII regions and massive dust complexes. A population synthesis program already available will be used to interpret the spectra in terms of stellar populations.|Y
EGEJC|IUE Observations & Support of Research on the Clusters of the Magellanic Clouds|Judith G.|Cohen|Cal Tech|We propose to observe at low resolution the integrated light of star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds. Optical observations of these clusters have indicated that some of the populous blue clusters are significantly younger than the galactic globular clusters they morphologically resemble. Recently, J. G. Cohen's investigation of the age-metallicity correlation among the Magellanic Cloud clusters has shown that it is quite different from that in the Galaxy. Infrared observations have led to the discovery of the presence of luminous carbon stars in Magellanic Cloud clusters of a certain age range. Ultraviolet observations will provide data in a new wavelength region, hence be sensitive to the contribution to the integrated light by a different range of spectral types than can be effectively studied at longer wavelengths. Observations of the young LMC clusters will be a useful comparison with planned ST searches for young galaxies.|Y

UV spectra are critical for determination of the galaxian stellar content, of metallicity of the physical conditions in the emission line regions, and of the relative contribution to the x-ray emission. The spectra obtained for these galaxies are similar to those of giant H II regions and have interesting implications for models for the origin of the UV flux in regions like 30 Dor.

EGETT|Ultraviolet Studies of Strong Nuclear Radio Sources in NormaSpiral Galaxies: Mini-Seyfert Nuclei or Starburst?|Trinh|Thuan|University of Virginia|Seven sessions of eight hours each during the low background shift are requested to obtain low resolution spectra with both the short and long wavelength cameras of the nuclear regions coincident with strong compact nuclear radio sources in 7 bright normal spiral galaxies. These observations will complement the radio, optical and X-ray observations in helping to elucidate the mini-Seyfert and starburst phenomena in nuclei of galaxies. The -physical parameters derived from these observations in mini-Seyfert nuclei such as temperature, density and ratio of line intensities will permit to study the Seyfert phenomenon at a level of activity which is two orders of magnitude smaller than in Seyfert galaxies : What is the ionization mechanism ? Shocks or photoionization by a power law spectrum ? What is a lower limit to the mass of the engine powering the radio source ? Is there a difference between radio sources in spiral and elliptical galaxies ? In starburstnuclei the UV observations give a measure of the present rate of star formation. Star ,formation in galactic nuclei can be compared to other types of star formation in galaxies, such as in blue compact dwarf galaxies. The distribution of the physical parameters can shed some light on a possible evolutionary link between the two types of nuclei.|Y

EGGEH|UV Spectroscopy of Emission Line Gas in the Central         Galaxies of X-Ray Luminous Clusters|Esther|Hu|Space Telescope Science Institute|Optical spectroscopy of the central galaxies in a number of clusters reported to have X-ray cooling flows has revealed low ionization emission line systems similar to those seen in narrow line radio galaxies (NLRG's). Line ratios in [NII] and [SII] indicate temperatures of 10^4 K and densities of 10^2 _ 10^3 cm^3. The Balmer decrements for these systems are unusually high, with characteristic values of 5-6. Comparison of colors and spectra with those of giant ellipticals and central cluster galaxies lacking emission line systems indicate that these lines-of-sight are not affected by global reddening. If dust is responsible for the high H-alpha/H-beta ratios it must be locally distributed within the emitting regions. A test of this hypothesis can be made by measuring the Ly-alpha/H-alpha flux.|Y

EGGSL|A Comparison of Star Formation Characteristics in Different Types of Irregular Galaxies|Susan A.|Lamb|Illinois|This proposal is directed toward further understanding the star formation processes in 'hot' galaxies through a comparison of IUE spectrophotometry of very high star formation rate irregular galaxies with that of regular Irr galaxies and of dwarf irregulars. These systems provide a good setting in which to explore such current concerns as the constancy of the initial mass function for massive OB stars and the possible role of "supermassive" stars. These observations will also yield much needed empirical data on the actual spectral characteristics of galaxies in star burst states.  We propose to make both LWR and SWP observations of our target galaxies as part of a larger observing program involving both optical and infrared observations. The large wavelength coverage will enable us to investigate the hot stellar component of these galaxies, to compare our results with theoretical evolutionary models of galaxies, and to obtain data on expected characteristics of hot galaxies viewed at large redshifts.|Y

EGHBA|Anomalous Absorption Features in Globular Cluster SWP Spectra|Bruce M.|Altner|A. R. CORP.|A systematic investigation of IUE globular cluster spectra is proposed in order to better understand the anomalous, broad absorption features that are frequently observed at 1600 A and, to a lesser extent, at 1400 A. These absorption dips have not been found in any stellar atmosphere models, nor have population synthesis studies yielded spectra that fit in those regions. It Is suggested that a quantitative approach, made possible by careful extraction from the spatially resolved spectra, may suggest correlations with other cluster properties. Additionally, synthetic spectra, derived from past IUE observations of single stars, are to be fit to the observations in an attempt to match the anomalous features while remaining consistent with UV colors.|Y
EGHCB|UV Spectroscopy of a Jet-Galaxy Interaction|C. Stuart|Bowyer|Berkeley|The galaxy complex comprising NGC 545, 547, 541 and the peculiar "galaxy" known as Minkowski's Object, has been mapped at 20 cm with the VLA and the field studied in the optical using CCD's at Lick and CTIO. Superposition of the optical and radio images strongly suggests that Minkowski's Object is the result of a jet-cloud interaction. Its blue color is indicative of non-thermal emission and the characteristics of emission lines in the optical spectra suggest shock heating or power-law photonization effects. Our aim is to determine the physical processes responsible for the emission and to ascertain how the various components of the multiple system are interacting. To distinguish between competing theoretical models of the jet physics, we require good estimates of the line strengths predicted to occur in the UV. In addition, the possible detection of the UV continuum, in providing a comparison with the extrapolated optical flux, will elucidate the nature of the synchrotron component(s) we expect to be present.|Y
EGHDW|Surface Brightness of NCG 4736|Daniel W.|Weedman|Penn State|In order to judge how a galaxy would appear at high redshift, it is necessary to know both its ultraviolet spectrum and surface brightness profile. This can be determined for bright spiral galaxies by placing the large IUE aperture on the disk. Following a successful program to do that for the disk of the galaxy NGC 1068, it is proposed to determine the ultraviolet spectrum and profile of the more normal galaxy NGC 4736. It is known from existing optical and UV data to be sufficiently bright. With the data in hand, the appearance of such a galaxy to redshift above 2 will be predicted.|Y
EGHFB|UV Spectroscopy of the Jet-Like NLR Condensations in NGC 4151|Frederick C.|Bruhweiler|Catholic University|The newly discovered jet-like 18" extension of knots of NLR gas from the nucleus of the nearby, bright Seyfert galaxy, NGC 4151, offers for the first time a unique opportunity to isolate and study NLR gas at ultraviolet wavelengths with the IUE. The fluxes of several UV emission lines are shown to be easily detected with the IUE. We propose to observe this jet-like extension by superimposing the major axis of the large (10"x22") aperture with the axis of the knots. The detected UV emission, plus any variation in line emission across the large aperture, would be an important test for current models for the NLR. These observations would provide fundamental information on two basic questions. Can photoionization from the central source explain the observed emission or must an explanation require other ionization processes? Also, do the jet-like NLR extensions in NGC 4151 share a similar origin to that of the radio jets present in this object and other extragalactic objects?|Y
EGHGM|Observations of Narrow-Lined Seyfert Galaxies|Gordon M.|MacAlpine|Michigan|The two unusually narrow-lined Seyfert galaxies Mkn 573 and Mkn 1388 provide excellent opportunities for accurate measurement of both strong and weak spectral features. Numerous line intensities at ultraviolet wavelengths are necessary for a thorough assessment of emitting gas physical conditions and chemical abundances. Our objective is a fully consistent study incorporating possible reddening and optical depth effects, including HeII Ly-alpha transfer, and utilizing the CIV 1549,/HeII 1640 ratio to constrain ionizing radiation properties. We have working, detailed photoionization and line transfer codes for comparison with the observations.|Y
EGHJH|Distant Blue Galaxies|John P.|Huchra|CFA|we propose to obtain IUE observations of blue emission line galaxies with spectra dominated by recent star formation. We will concentrate on galaxies with redshifts sufficient to move their intrinsic Ly-alpha out from underneath the geocorona. A few of the galaxies we will observe are objects with extremely blue colors which may be examples of young galaxies undergoing their first star-formation epoch. The questions we hope to answer are (1) how much Ly-alpha emission will be observable in young galaxies at high redshift, (2) what is the escape mechanism for the Ly-alpha of emission that is seen, and (3) what are the predicted colors and makeup of samples of faint, very high redshift galaxies.|Y
EGHRD|IUE Observations of I ZW 18|Reginald J.|Dufour|Rice University|I Zw 18 is a galaxy of unique importance to astrophysics because it has the lowest metallicity of any system currently known. It is quite likely that it consists of an intergalactic "cloud' currently undergoing its first significant burst of star formation and chemical enrichment. We propose to acquire several long (7+ hour) exposure low dispersion SWP spectra of the brightest (NW) H II region in I Zw 18 with the IUE in order to obtain a high signal-to-noise spectrum in the XX1208-195e wavelength region to study the: (1) gaseous phase abundances of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and silicon in the nebula; (2) properties of the local interstellar extinction; and (3) characteristics of the 08 star population embedded in the nebula. The results should have a significant impact on our knowledge about the early epoch of star-formation and chemical enrichment in galaxies.|Y
EGHRP|IUE Observations of the Inner Jet of Centaurus A|Robert L.|Pennington|Minnesota|A new image processing study of Centaurus A (NGC 5128) in UBV passbands has revealed several elongated optical features Coincident with X-ray and radio knots in the "inner jet" NE of the nucleus (at radial distances from the nucleus up to 5.4 arc min). These features are brightest in the U passband and consequently may be quite prominent in the ultraviolet relative to the surrounding elliptical light of the galaxy. We propose to acquire low dispersion SWP spectra of three of the features (and a nearby comparison region) with the IUE in an attempt to detect ultraviolet line and/or continuum emission which should permit determination of the physical nature of the material comprising this jet. We will also attempt to confirm a U excess in the inner halo originally detected by the PI.|Y
EGHSS|A Study of Interacting Seyfert Galaxies|Steven N.|Shore|CSC|The focus of this proposed study is a group of Sy 1 and 2 galaxies which are members of tidally interacting systems. New low dispersion LWP and SWP spectra will be used, along with archival spectra, to compare the indicators of nuclear activity in these galaxies with isolated Seyferts of the same optical spectral morphology in order to see what effect the interaction has on the nuclear luminosity and rate of feeding of the central engine. We emphasize that the dynamical interactions among members of this sample of galaxies provide limits on the timescales involved in the enhanced nuclear emission and on the details of the feeding process not available for the systems in isolation.|Y
EGIDB|Observations of the UV Energy Distributions of Elliptical Galaxies|David|Burstein|Arizona State Uninversity|An analysis of the IUE spectra of 30 E and SO galaxies has confirmed the positive correlation of UV flux with metallicity in these galaxies, first discovered by Faber. Interpretation of this relationship is complicated both by the similarity of the predicted UV energy distributions of the different models of hot stellar populations, and by the lack of high quality spectra of several key galaxies. We propose here to obtain those spectra. We also show that, for large extended sources like these nearby galaxies, IUE is competitive with the Hubble Space Telescope for low resolution UV spectroscopy of integrated stellar populations.|Y
EGIJH|Elliptical Seyfert Galaxies|Jules P.|Halpern|Columbia|Seyfert type I nuclei have recently been discovered in two elliptical galaxies, Arp 102 B and NGC 6212. The existence of Seyfert nuclei in any elliptical galaxy was doubted until now. Of current interest is the existence of central mass concentrations in elliptical galaxies and the hypothesis that binary Seyfert nuclei may be formed by collisions between galaxies. Arp 102 B has unusual double-peaked Balmer line profiles of a type which motivated this binary hypothesis. A crucial test is whether or not the broad-line profiles are the same for species of different ionization potential and critical density (CIII, CIII], CIV). IUE spectra are also needed to measure the flux of the nonstellar ionizing continuum. Since starlight dominates the optical spectrum of these two Seyferts, an accurate determination of the nonstellar flux (powerlaw or thermal) can be made only in the UV.|Y
EGIJS|Archive Studies of Seyfert Absorption Components|J. Michael|Shull|Colorado - CASA|We propose to use IUE archive data on three Seyfert Galaxies, NGC 3516, NGC 4151, and NGC 4051, to study the absorption and variability of C IV, Si IV, Mg II, and N V broad emission lines. In a previous archive program, we discovered interesting relationships between the equivalent width, depth, and velocity width of C IV absorption, as the luminosity of NGC 3516 changed. Our theoretical models of line formation in an expanding broad-line cloud region suggest that the absorption may come from a peculiar geometry of "clouds" or a disk, triggered by thermal instability or additional ionization of C IV. The observations seem to require 100 such clouds, to cover the 1000 km/s velocity interval of absorption. However, since each broadline cloud is opaque to ionizing radiation that produces C IV, the clouds would shield each other, an additional source of ionization is required.  This year, we propose to study the same effects in the other two Seyferts, and to stack the many IUE exposures of NGC 4151 to understand the low ionization (O I, C II, Si II, Fe II, and Al III) absorption features, which may be related to galactic nuclear matter because of their variability. Finally, we plan to search for weak, time-stationary absorption features indicative of a "global H II region" (the interstellar medium of the Seyfert, photoionized by UV and X-rays from the active nucleus).|Y
EGIMM|Polarization and the Ultraviolet Excess of Quasars|Matthew A.|Malkan|CAL LA|We have wavelength dependent polarimetry for several "normal" quasars, and propose obtaining uv spectra of these objects to study how the polarization is related to the ultraviolet excess flux. Observing these five quasars will not only double our total sample size, but will also test the polarization--thermal component relation over a range of: object luminosities, radio intensities, uv excess strengths, and thermal component temperatures. Using the multiwavelength continuum fitting technique successfully applied to earlier IUE observations (Malkan 1983); we will derive the hole mass and accretion rate required for a disk to produce the uv excess. Using a newly developed scattering code for disks, we will calculate the polarization that arises naturally from electron scattering in an inclined disk defined by these fitting parameters. We will determine if the polarizations calculated for the disk model are consistent with the range of observations. If one or more of the disk models can account for the observed polarizations, we will set limits on tile possible disk shapes, vertical structures, orientations, and optical depths.|Y
EGITT|The Effects of Cluster Environment on Star Formation in Dwarf Galaxies|Trinh X.|Thuan|Virginia|Blue compact dwarf (BCD) galaxies represent, par excellence, the ideal laboratory to study modes of star formation other than density-wave triggered star-formation because their small masses cannot sustain density-waves. IUE in its past years of operation has already accumulated a wealth of data on the ultraviolet properties of BCDs in non-clustered sparse environments. A recent catalogue of dwarf galaxies in the Virgo cluster by Binggeli, Sandage and Tammann offers an excellent opportunity to study BCDs in a clustered environment. IUE UV observations of several of the brightest BCDs in Bingelli et al. list will permit to study the effects of cluster environment on star formation in dwarf galaxies. How do the rates of star formation in BCDs in a cluster environment such as the Virgo cluster and those in BCDs in the field compare? If they are similar, this would mean that the mechanisms which trigger star formation in dwarf galaxies are independent of environment and must be internal to the galaxies (e.g. stochastic cloud collisions). If the rates of star formation are different (presumably higher) for the Virgo BCDs than for the field BCDs, then star formation must be environmentally induced (e.g. tidal influences from close encounters with more massive galaxies in the cluster). The variation of the star-formation rate in Virgo BCDs as a function of the local density of galaxies within the Virgo cluster can also be studied.|Y
EGJDW|Are the Galaxies in the Bootes Void Young?|Donna E.|Weistrop|Applied Research Corp.|Recent observations have indicated the presence of voids in the largescale structure of the universe. Upon closer examination, the Bootes void is found to be a region devoid of the most luminous galaxies, but occupied by several emission-line galaxies. Analysis of the groundbased spectra for three of these objects indicates they resemble the so-called H II region-like galaxies, i.e. the excitation mechanism of the emission lines is most likely radiation from young O and B stars. Furthermore, the observations indicate that the oxygen and nitrogen abundances of the void galaxies are low compared to the abundances Of H II regions in our own galaxy. There are several hypotheses as to the cause of this metal deficiency, but the only viable one appears to be that the galaxies are young. Because of the importance of this conclusion to our understanding of the physical conditions and history of galaxy formation in the voids, we propose to test this hypothesis by using IUE spectra to obtain the chemical abundance of carbon in these objects.|Y
EGKAD|UV Diagnostics of the Starburst in the Interacting Galaxy Pair ES296-IG11|Anthony C.|Danks|ARC|Detailed optical spectrophotometry of the peculiar galaxy pair ESO 296-IG 11 (the "Clothehook" has shown that these two edge-on orthogonal galaxies form an interacting pair rather than a chance projection. The many individual emission regions show evidence of a large variety of Ionization conditions. Over the extent of the two galaxies the, spatially resolved, optical spectra show conditions which indicate giant HII regions, shock ionisation and possible power-low type photoionisation Test observations under previous allocations at the position angle of 283 degrees have shown the presence of a very rich population of young stars. Flux at 1500A corresponds to some 10^4 times the flux of 30 Dor, extending over a large portion of the Large aperture. To complete the energy diagnostic of this galaxy and its companion (P.A 195 deg.), we need to obtain better S/N data. This will allow us to determine the detailed nature of the young stellar population, the ionizing conditions, and in outside the regions of violent star formation, and identify the source of ionization in the companion galaxy. The excitation does not appear to be driven by early type stars but rather by photo-ionisation or shocks. Although the galaxies are relatiYely distant (95 Mpc) they are sufficiently structured that the different regions of excitation can be identified in IUE spectra with S/N of at least 20.|Y
EGKDB|Sources of UV Flux in Early-Type Galaxies|David|Burstein|Arizona State University|In a paper in press (Burstein at al. 1988), we show that the level of far-UV flux (relative to optical flux) in 24 'normal' early-type galaxies is strongly correlated with their metallicity. The UV spectra of 4 'active' early-type galaxies show both similarities and differences compared to those of normal galaxies of similar overall UV flux, while the UV spectra of 'starforming' galaxies show clear evidence of ongoing star formation. However, the physical source(s) of UV flux in active and normal galaxies cannot yet be unambiguously identified for two reasons: a) similarity of UV energy distributions of hot stellar populations and b) missing and low SIN LW spectra of key active and mildly star-forming galaxies (e.g. N4486=M87; the hot stellar population contributes 50% of the flux at 2660 A). We propose here to obtain high SIN LWP spectra to better define the differences (and similarities) of the strong UV component among normal, active and star-forming galaxies. Four representative galaxies have been chosen for study: N4486, N1052, N4742 and N4111. Our analysis of these data should serve both to better define the mean temperatures of the main sequence turnoffs in these galaxies, as well as the presence (or absence) of special features in the spectral energy distributions, such as excess emission between 2000 -2500 A in active galaxies (the so-called 'blue bump').|Y
EGKGR|UV and Optical Observations of Liners|Gail A.|Reichert|CSC IUE|Recently developed software now allows us to use the known spatial responses of the IUE cameras to separate the nuclear ultraviolet emission in Liners from the more extended emission arising from integrated starlight. Application of the technique to the long wavelength spectra of two Liners, NGC 404 and NGC 3998, has produced some intriguing but inconclusive results. Short wavelength spectra of higher signal to noise are required before any definitive statements concerning the nature of the nuclear emission can be made. The technique has obvious potential for studies of other Liners as well. We propose new observations of four Liners - NGC 404, 3998, 4579, and M81 - in order to obtain SWP (and LWP) spectra of high enough quality that the nuclear and extended emission can be separated. Our aims are to study the component spectra to 1) establish whether the observed ultraviolet continuua within the nuclei indicate sufficient ionizing fluxes to photoionize the gas and produce the emission lines, 2) search for absorption lines such as Si IV 1400 A which are indicators of hot stars (and verify the presence of these in NGC 404), 3) determine from stellar population synthesis whether the nuclear emission can be explained by hot stars alone, 4) measure the strengths of ultraviolet emission lines (especially in NGC 3998), in order to determine the physical state of the gas and obtain clues concerning the ionization mechanism, and 5) search for systematic differences in the ultraviolet spectra of Liners whose emission line properties differ in some respects. We also wish to confirm the possible presence of extranuclear emission line gas in NGC 3998. For the SWP spectra, we will require exposures of 16 hours; these will give us nearly optimally exposed spectra. Our European collaborators are submitting a related proposal to ESA so that we can obtain contiguous pairs of shifts. Contemporaneous LWP exposures are needed to ensure that the long and short wavelength spectra refer to the same stars; single shifts will be adequate for these. We are requesting a total of 11 shifts (6 NASA, 5 Vilspa). Near-concurrent optical observations will continue to be carried out at ground-based telescopes.|Y
EGKRW|NGC 6166 An Extreme UV-Excess Elliptical Galaxy|Rosemary|Wyse|Johns Hopkins|The short wavelength UV excess observed in several elliptical galaxies is an important but poorly understood clue to the evolution of stellar populations. Significant continuing star formation, but perhaps with a non-standard stellar initial mass function, is inferred from X-ray observations of some elliptical galaxies, which show the existence of 'cooling flows'. The cD NGC6166 has the largest known galactic UV excess, and one of the largest low-redshift cooling flows, suggesting a causal relation between these two phenomena. We require higher quality data for NGC6166 to allow detailed analysis of our multi-wavelength data set on this galaxy, as part of a larger study of the general problem of star formation and galaxy evolution.|Y
EGKTT|Ultraviolet Spectral Synthesis of Starburst Galaxies|Trinh X.|Thuan|Virginia|The starburst phenomenon is ubiquitous in the Universe, occuring in a wide variety of environments and over a large range of redshifts. IUE in its past years of operation has already accumulated a wealth of data on the ultraviolet properties of nearby starburst galaxies, but for the majority of the galaxies which have been studied, only short wavelength (1200-2000 A) spectra exist. We propose here to obtain the complementary long wavelength (2000-3000 A) spectra. This is needed to perform the ultraviolet spectral synthesis of the sample of starburst galaxies which already possess good signal-to-noise short wavelength spectra. While SWP spectra provide information on the OB young stellar populations, i.e. on the 120 to 4 MC) mass range, LWP spectra put constraints on the AFG stellar populations, i.e. on the 4 to 1 M(sun) mass range, and provide the missing link between the ultraviolet SWP spectra and the optical spectra which exist for most of the starburst galaxies. The optical and ultraviolet data can put constraints on the star formation history of starburst galaxies as characterized by the Initial Mass Function (IMF), the star formation. rate, the age or duration of the burst of star formation and the number of bursts before the present one. The latter two items can be derived from the jumps and discontinuities in the present-day luminosity function. One question of particular interest is whether the IMF is truncated at the low mass end (~ 4 M(sun); the LWP spectra are particularly useful for this purpose) implying perhaps bimodal star formation in some starburst galaxies.|Y
EGLAC|NGC 1275, High Velocity Filamentary System|Adeline|Caulet|NASA/GSFC|The extensive filamentary system surrounding NGC 1275 is known to exhibit two velocity components, one at 5200 km/s which is the same as the velocity of NGC 1275 itself, and one at 8300 km/s. The low velocity (LV) system has been studied extensively with a view to elucidating the nature of a putative cooling flow of intracluster (A426) gas into NGC1275. A plausible hypothesis based on optical and radio data describes the high velocity (HV) system as a late-type galaxy caught in the gravitational potential well of NGC 1275 and falling into it with a velocity of about 3000 km/s. In this picture the HV filaments are composed of giant HII regions which have been imaged in H-alpha and observed spectroscopically in other optical lines. Our lack of certainty about the morphology of the HV system, the dynamical relationship between the HV and LV systems, and the optical spectral characteristics of the HV filaments coupled with the fact that spiral galaxies are rare in the inner regions of A426 make this hypothesis tentative. Yet it is important to understand the nature of the HV system in order to properly interpret observations of the LV system in terms of a cooling flow. We propose to obtain vacuum ultraviolet spectra with the IUE of several emission regions of the HV system. The objectives are: a) to use any observed vacuum ultraviolet emission lines together with existing optical emission line data to infer the physical processes by which the emission lines are produced, b) to use any vacuum ultraviolet emission line data to help determine abundances, particularly that of carbon, with a view to finding evidence bearing on the origin of the HV system, and c) and to search for an ultraviolet continuum characteristic of an OB stellar population. The proposed work is part of a larger effort to obtain groundbased Fabry-Perot imagery and sounding rocket vacuum ultraviolet imagery of the HV and LV systems.|Y
EGLFB|The Extended NLR of NGC 1068: A Test of Ionization Models|Frederick C.|Bruhweiler|Catholic University|The Seyfert 2 galaxy, NGC 1068, displays spectacular extranuclear emission. In our IUE observations sampling mainly starburst knots, the total N V and C IV fluxes in the extranuclear emission are 1/3 of that seen in the nucleus itself with the brightest N V and C IV emission found 25" from the nucleus! The brightness, the high ionization, and distance from the nucleus of the emitting gas together represent a stringent test for any proposed ionization model. Observations show that extranuclear emission is a common characteristic of galaxies containing AGNs. The proximity of NGC 1068 and its UV-bright emission present a unique opportunity to probe spatially such gas in a galaxy with an AGN. Building upon our current study, we will: a.) Use our developed spatial mapping techniques to determine the distribution and ionization of the extended emitting gas. We can easily ascertain if emission is correlated with starburst knots, and assess the role of stellar photoionization in explaining the emission.  b.) Use the high ionization features observed in both SWP and LWP cameras and ties to optical data to uniquely define the mechanism producing the observed ionization.  We have carefully selected our IUE pointing so they too provide independent tests as to whether enhanced central source photoionization or shock ionization apply.|Y
EGLGR|Simultaneous EUV and UV Observations of Active Galaxies|Gail A.|Reichert|CSC|We propose IUE observations of four of the brightest nearby AGN, to be performed concurrently with Voyager observations, in order to extend our knowledge of their spectra down to rest wavelengths < 900A . The four AGN would be chosen from the following list: 3C 273, Fairall 9, NGC 4151, ESO 141-G55, H 1143 182, NGC 5548, and Akn 120, according to spacecraft, solar angle, and other constraints. Our goals are to 1) probe the intrinsic extreme ultraviolet continua of AGN, 2) relate the extreme ultraviolet and ultraviolet continua and thereby test various models for the spectral decomposition of the continuum, 3) for the objects with high enough redshifts (3C 273, and possibly Fairall 9), search for (or verify) the presence of rest frame Lyman continuum absorption, and 4) estimate (if possible) the strengths of the 0 VI 1035A emission lines and compare these with estimates of the ionizing fluxes based on the spectral decompositions. Six of the objects are known to be highly variable, and our experience with Voyager observations of AGN (e.g. 3C 273, Mrk 509) indicates that the amplitude of variability increases sharply towards shorter wavelengths. It is thus critical to not only measure the spectrum at one epoch, but also to monitor the spectral variability over as wide a bandpass as possible, if we are to hope to unravel the nature of the continuum source(s) and emission.|Y
EGMAD|A Study of the Stellar Population in Selected SO Galaxies|Anthony C.|Danks|ARC|We propose to obtain IUE short wavelength (1200-2000 A) and long wavelength (2000-3000 A) spectra of a few selected SO or Lenticular galaxies to determine their stellar contents. The particular emphasis is on looking for evidence of recent star formation, as indicated by the presence of earlytype stars. This is an important test of galaxy models in which SO galaxies are differentiated from normal Spirals by a very low gas content. The complete UV spectrum, SWP and LWP, covered by IUE provides optimum information on the OB stellar populations (130 to 4 M(sun) and on late-type populations (4 to 0.5 M(sun), respectively. Recent IRAS observations show evidence for non-cirrus type emission, i.e., warm (lust; the proposed IUE observations will look for evidence of the star formation normally associated with the dust and cold gas. It is our intention to define the morphology of the galaxies to be studied through CCD images in the visible, infrared, via IRAS, and visual photometry. We emphasize that to date, SO galaxies have not been studied as a homogeneous class. Our request for 6 shifts is realistic based on experience as past IUE users and will significantly increase the sample of SO galaxies available for synthesis and related studies.|Y
EGMAS|UV Spectroscopy of Starburst Regions in Selected Ring Galaxies|Alfred B.|Schultz|STScI|we propose to observe and compare the ultraviolet spectra of three ring galaxies, Arp 146, Arp 147, and Arp 150. The first two of these ring systems exhibit a fairly uncomplicated structure, each featuring a nearby, relatively undisturbed companion with a bright nucleus. Both of these ring galaxies clearly exhibit non-nuclear starburst activity. The compact cluster Arp 150, a more complex system, has three well-defined members and a small, bright companion connected to the brightest member by a luminous filament in a ring-like form. We propose to observe this cluster in order to scale the star formation rates in the individual structures with the rates for Arp 146 and Arp 147. A supernova was observed in this cluster in 1973, which perhaps can serve as an approximate scaling reference point for our observations.  The proposed observations are needed to clarify and codify the optical observations and theoretical work on the starburst phenomena. The IUE spectral study will yield parameters needed to determine the mean ionization levels and temperatures in each of the ring galaxies and their companions. This will supplement the BVRI ground-based photometry performed previously on Arp 146 and Arp 147.|Y
EGMDB|UV Energy Distributions of Mildly-Star-Forming Early-Type Galaxies|David|Burstein|Arizona State University|A physical understanding of the source(s) of far-UV emission in early-type galaxies is important for the study of: post-main sequence stellar evolution; star formation in X-ray cooling flows; and the evolution of stellar populations with look-back time. Previous studies have shown that the far-UV (<2000A) spectral energy distributions of early-type galaxies can be produced by the majority old stellar population (post-asymptotic-giant-branch stars), by a possible minority population of ongoing star formation, or by some combination thereof. Moreover, active and normal galaxies of similar metallicity have similar Uv spectral energy distributions. Disentangling the relative contributions of old and young stars to the UV requires both additional data and further theoretical work. we propose here to obtain high S/N SW and LW spectra of galaxies known or strongly suspected to have ongoing star formation that does not dominate their optical flux (i.e., mildly-starforming). Spectra of such galaxies fill a significant gap in our current library of early-type galaxy spectra (~35 galaxies). Newly-developed data analysis techniques for quantifying differences among the UV spectra of galaxies will be applied both to these new spectra, as well as to the existing library spectra.|Y
EGMPH|Galaxies Behind the Magellanic Clouds|Paul W.|Hodge|Washington|There are several relatively bright galaxies visible through the Magellanic Clouds. These provide a unique opportunity to determine the total amount of reddening caused by the dust in the Clouds. It is proposed to observe them with IUE and at optical wavelengths and to compare the results with those for unreddened galaxies of the same Hubble types.|Y
EGNES|The Carbon Abundance in SBS 0335-052 and the Time Evolution of C/O|Evan D.|Skillman|U Minnesota|We propose to observe the newly discovered, very low metallicity emission line galaxy SBS 0335-052 in order to obtain an accurate carbon abundance. This observation will be added to previous IUE observations of H II regions spanning a large range in metallicity, and this will allow us to better determine the variation of C/O as a function of metallicity. Presently, there is some uncertainty in the behavior of the C/O ratio as determined from stars, and a clearer picture may be evolving from the accumulated H II region data. Past experience with IUE observations of similar objects (I Zw 18 and UGC 4483) leads us to propose 3 combined (1/2)US2+VILSPA+US1 shifts.|Y
EHEBS|A Study of Magellanic Cloud Halo Gas|Blair D.|Savage|Wisconsin|Six low radiation shifts are requested to obtain high dispersion SWP spectra of 3 LMC and 3 SMC stars. The data will be combined with all existing high dispersion LMC/SMC interstellar absorption line data to determine if the Magellanic Clouds are surrounded by halo gas. The target stars exist in regions relatively free of nebulosity and are generally cooler than those previously observed. Thus, nebular contamination problems should be minimized for the targets stars.|Y
EHEEJ|Lyman Alpha Halos of Galaxies|E. B.|Jenkins|Princeton|QSO absorption lines [z abs < z (QSO)] arise from several possible sources, one of which is extended regions of intervening galaxies. There is now no empirical link between gaseous extensions of galaxies with no visible star light and the properties of QSO spectra. We propose to make such an empirical connection by detecting the Ly-alpha line in absorption from the outer parts of galaxies. This line frequently occurs in QSO absorption line systems. If we are successful, the geometry of the extensions (flattened disk or spherical halos) can be determined by noting the correlation of detected lines with galaxy inclination. If we are unsuccessful in detecting Ly-alpha, important statistical constraints can be put on the probability that QSO absorption lines arise from intervening galaxies. We will use the SWP camera of IUE in the low dispersion mode to observe bright QSO's, positioned so that Ly-alpha from known intervening galaxies should be detected.|Y

EHJPH|H II Regions in M31|Paul W.|Hodge|Washington|Although many IUE observations have been made for bright, giant HII regions in late type galaxies (Sc's and Irr's), there have been no IUE observations for HII regions in M31 (Sb). Even at other wavelengths. it is just recently that extensive observations of these objects have been obtained. Because these recent viisual-wavelength observations suggest that M31's HII regions are different in several ways from typical giant HII regions in other galaxies, such as M33, we propose to obtain IUE spectra in order to add to our data base for these objects, being collected for the purpose of comparing models that we are calculating. We hope thereby to find out what is the cause of the observed differences in brightness and morphology; is the IMF different. is it the abundances, is it related to the gas density structure or gas motions, the dust characteristics, or some other cause? Although M31 has none of the very bright giant HII regions that are found in Sc galaxies. we have been able to choose some relatively compact, high-surface-brightness HII regions that are favorable objects for the IUE.|Y

ELNAM|Coodinated IUE-Groundbased Observations of the Peculiar Object MWC 560|Andrew G.|Michalitsianos|NASA/GSFC|We propose to investigate the evolution of the ultraviolet spectrum of the peculiar emission-line object 14WC 560 in the postoutburst stage, to see if it develops a classical symbiotic-star (nebular) spectrum, as we have predicted, or if it behaves otherwise. We have recently observed this object with IUE in two prior phases: (a) an "unstable preoutburst phase", in which a complex broad-line or blended absorption spectrum (system velocity, always blue-shifted, attains absolute values as large as 6000 km/s) of Fe II and other cool species are seen to shift by hundreds or thousands of km/s from one velocity to another in a systematic way, while a narrow-line absorption system remains at a constant velocity of about 50 km/s; (b) a novalike "outburst phase" in which the spectrum just described under "(a)" was replaced by an ultraviolet spectrum with no identifiable features, but which closely resembles the ultraviolet spectra of several recent novae as observed within a week or two after their photometric eruptions. We suspect that MWC 560 may be undergoing a mass ejection event resembling those that presumably produced one or more of the prominent circumstellar jets and nebulae in the classical symbiotic star R Aquarii. The current outburst in MWC 560 thus may offer a very rare opportunity to investigate such a phenomenon. Specific astrophysical objectives of the study include: determining the dynamical timescale of the envelope, measuring the ultraviolet flux distribution of the hot component(s) in the system (which is/are presently obscured by the dense ejected shell), and determining the light curves of permitted and intersystem emission lines that emerge as the optical depth of the shell decreases. These observations will be coordinated with ground-based spectral observations of MWC 560 to monitor the visual emission line spectrum during the shell phase.|Y

ENLJR|The Onset of Cooling in Cygnus Loop Shock Waves|John C.|Raymond|CFA|In spite of extensive IUE observations of the Cygnus Loop, only a fraction of a percent of the optical filaments have been looked at, and the observations have been strongly biased toward the flilaments most easily observed; those bright in [O III]. We propose to sample a type of shock wave which is not represented in the IUE database, both to understand the dominant physical processes in those regions and to help combine ME data with Voyager and optical A data to construct spectra of the NE portion of the Cygnus Loop complete from 912 A through the optical range. We have chosen a filament in which radiative cooling is just beginning to significantly reduce the temperature of the shocked gas in order to study the thermally unstable cooling process and to search for effects due to grain cooling and thermal conduction. We consider these observations quite important because HST is poorly suited for observing diffuse UV emission, and no other satellite capable of making these observations is planned for many years.|Y
ENMRR|Silicon and Carbon Abundances in the Orion Nebula|Robert H.|Rubin|NASA - AMES|We request IUE observing time to obtain high dispersion SWP and LWP spectra of several (largely outer) positions in the Orion Nebula of particular importance for developing an improved axisymmetric "blister" model of the gas (and dust) in this "prototypical" Galactic H II region. These new observations will be combined with existing selected reprocessed IUE spectra, extensive ground-based spectrophotometry and CCD imagery of the entire nebula, KAO infrared observations, and a well developed code that models this object. Of specific scientific interest is our plan to determine the gas phase abundances and ionization structure of Si and C by interpreting the observable UV emission lines of Si III] 1882-1892 A, C III] 1907-1909 A, C II] 2325-29 A, and possibly others, over a well sampled region of the ionized nebula. These will be compared with the gas phase abundances for Si and C inferred from the strength of the [SiII] 34.8 microns and [C II] 158 microns lines already observed in Orion and believed to arise in the photodissociation regions (PDR) buffering the H II region. Because Si and C may exist in both the gaseous state and in grains, the comparison between the gas phase abundance in the H II region and the PDR will allow us to address the question of dust survival in the ionized volume.|Y

EPEJC|Research on the Stellar Population of Normal Galaxies|Judith G.|Cohen|Cal Tech|We propose to continue observations at low resolution of the nuclei of normal galaxies and of globular clusters to derive information on the stellar population. By combining IUE observations with optical and infrared spectrophotometry, we hope to model the stellar content of galactic nuclei based on the components normally seen in the old stellar population of galactic globular clusters. We shall use our observationally calibrated theoretical models to predict ultraviolet fluxes expected from stars present in old stellar populations, and thus to set limits on the possible presence of young O and B stars. Our models can successfully reproduce fluxes in globular clusters from 3500 to 2.4 V.  Since the nuclei of normal galaxies are rather faint in the ultraviolet, the low resolution mode is required with exposures approaching an entire 8 hour shift necessary in many cases. We therefore request 6 low background shifts and 8 NASA shift 2 sessions.|Y
EPFJG|High Star Formation Rate Irregular Galaxies and the IMF of Massive Stars|John S.|Gallagher|Illinois|This proposal is directed toward further understanding the star formation processes in galaxies through IUE spectrophotometry of very high star formation rate irregular galaxies. These systems provide a good and an unusual setting in which to explore such current concerns as the constancy of the initial mass function for massive OB stars and the possible role of "supermassive" stars. These observations will also yield much needed empirical data on the actual spectral characteristics of galaxies in stir burst states.  We propose to make both LWR and SWR observations of these galaxies as part of a larger observing program involving both optical and infrared observations. The large wavelength coverage will enable us to investigate the hot stellar component of these galaxies and to compare our results with theoretical evolutionary models of galaxies.|Y

ERNEG|ER Vul: Laboratory for Studying Solar Magnetic Activity in the Extreme Levels|Edward F.|Guinan|Villanova University|ER Vul is an extraordinarily active, short period (0.7 day) detached binary consisting of G1V and G2V components.  It has a history of dramatic, rapid (minutes to hours) fluctuations in its light curves.  Like RS CVn stars, its light curves exhibit evidence of a migrating wave distortion.  The rapid changes could be due to white light flares while the larget asymmetries are thought to be caused by the presence of large starspot regions on both components.  ER Vul has the brightest coronal and chromospheric emission of any main sequence G star, most likely due to tidally-enforced rapid rotation.  Thus, ER Vul is important to study because the physical characteristics of the componentns (temperatures, masses, and radii) are nearly identical to the Sun except that the stars rotate over 40 times faster.  It is also a binary which may be evolving toward the contact state due to large angular momentum loss through magnetic braking and thus could play a significant role in understanding the formation of W UMa contact systems.  We are proposing an intensive, world-wide campaign to secure a definitive multi-frequence study of this important binary in which IUE observations will play the crucial role.  We plan a coordinated effort consisting of radio, IR, photometric, and UV observations to coincide in part with the global campaign.  ER Vul can be a unique laboratory for studying solar-like activity at extreme levels for stars that, while rotating rapidly, are not in the complicating contact configuration.|Y

These changes parallel the evolution of RR Tel. Because symbiotic novae are so rare, no UV spectra have ever been obtained during this stage of development.  We propose to measure the temperature and electron density of the emission region of PU Vul using line ratios in the UV. High resolution spectra are required to accurately estimate these parameters because the tremendous number of emission lines result in blending at low resolution. Near simultaneous optical spectra will be taken and compared with the IUE results.|Y

EVPCA|Simultaneous IUE and EUVE Spectroscopy of the Flare Star EV Lac|Carol W.|Ambruster|Villanova University|Time has been granted on EUVE for a 100 ksec spectroscopic observation of the nearby, classical flare star EV Lac. This observation will take place between 8 and 13 September 1993, to coincide with a major international optical campaign on the star organized by Co-I R. Gershberg. We request IUE coverage during the EUVE observation (which will take ~4 d, nicely coinciding with the star's P(rot) of 4.375 d) in order to obtain a simultaneous and complete set of coronal, TR, and chromospheric emission lines over a temperature range 10^4 - 10^7 K . We will use the data to compute Volume Emission Measure models of the complete upper atmosphere of a dMe flare star for the first time. We chose EV Lac: a) because it is single, and b) because it has a history of prodigious flares. Our main goal is to model the quiescent atmosphere, looking for conditions that might predispose the star to extreme flares. If a flare occurs, it will be modelled as well.|Y
EXNDM|The UV Extinction Properties of Carina Nebular Dust|Derck L.|Massa|Applied Research Corp.|We are requesting 2 US1 and 2 US2 shifts to obtain low dispersion spectra of OB stars in the Carina Nebular cluster Tr 16. combined with previous IUE measurements, the new observations will enable us, for the first time, to isolate the ultraviolet extinction properties of dust in a dense molecular environment. We will also derive H I column densities allowing us to determine whether the gas-to-dust ratio increases inside the cloud -- a result expected if coagulation of grains is occuring.|Y
EXNDW|UV Extinction in High Latitude Clouds. II|Daniel E.|Welty|U Chicago|We propose to determine the LTV extinction in a number of nearby high latitude molecular clouds (HLC's) by obtaining low-dispersion spectra of early B stars located behind the clouds. The HLC's are nearby (typically within -200 pc) and isolated, with little confusion from other clouds along the same lines of sight; they are thus excellent candidates for comparing the emission and absorption characteristics of individual interstellar clouds. Comparison of the LTV extinction with the infrared emission observed by IRAS should provide constraints on the grain size and composition distributions, and may lead to better understanding of the relationships among AV, Iv (100 microns) and cloud mass and of what role shocks may have played in the formation or the HLC's. Knowledge of the UV extinction is also essential for understanding the ambient radiation field in the cloud cores, and thus for studies of the ionization equilibrium, abundances, and molecular chemistry.  The UV extinction curve obtained during the previous year for HD 210121, a B3 V star located behind the dense core of an HLC is among the steepest known in the Galaxy. Additional early B stars have been identified in the vicinities of other HLC's; we would like to extend our study of the extinction characteristics of these objects to determine whether such extreme extinction is a common feature, thus perhaps providing clues to understanding the IR emission and enhanced molecular abundances.|Y

FARBP|International AGN Watch: Variability of the High-Luminosity AGN Fairall 9|Bradley M.|Peterson|Ohio State University|We propose to extend a monitoring campaign on the luminous AGN Fairall 9 in order to address issues concerning short time-scale variations which appear to have been undersampled in previous efforts. We will examine the high-frequency continuum variations and determine the time scale for response of the highest ionization lines, such as He II lambda 1640 and N V lambda 1240. We also suspect that the C IV and Ly-alpha response times previously reported are biased toward long lags by the poor sampling of the light curves on short time scales, and we will attempt to remeasure the emission-line lags for these lines as well. We propose to observe Fairall 9 once every four days, using one half of a US1 or VILSPA shift, thereby extending this on-going project to seven months. This will provide an order of magnitude improvement in the sampling rate relative to previous IUE observations of this source. Extension of this program through the full observability window is highly desirable since the emission-line lags are likely to be substantially longer than measured in previous high-intensity monitoring campaigns. Twenty-four VILSPA and 14 US1 half-shifts have already been allocated to this project. We request 10 additional US1 half shifts as a further US contribution to this effort.|Y

FBBJG|IUE Observing Time and Support of Research on Faint Blue Stars|Jesse L.|Greenstein|Cal Tech|Preliminary results from the first observing run by Greenstein and Oke with IUE  were illuminating and encouraging, revealing unexpected new phenomena. One of the collaborators, Greenstein, proposes to continue to observe ultraviolet spectra of further, hot-subluminous sdO and sdB stars on which Greenstein and Oke have ground-based data, and of those degenerate stars, sufficiently bright in the ultraviolet, concerning which ground-based data raise the most interesting questions. The two main areas of scientific question are: 1.  For the hottest subluminous stars, we wish to know (A) How hot can they be? (B) Composition anomalies caused by core or shell nucleosynthesis. (C) For how many is mass loss now an important factor in evolution? (D) Is there continuity or a gap between sdO and degenerate stars?  (E)  Can interstellar Ly-alpha determine the luminosities of hydrogen deficient sdO's? 2.  For degenerate stars, we wish to know (A) How hot can they be? (B) Is there a complete dichotomy in composition between those with hydrogen and with helium atmospheres? (C) Are any degenerates relatively metal-rich, or is there evidence for complete diffusive or radiation-pressure separation of the elements?|Y
FBBRG|A Study of Hot White Dwarfs from the Palomar Green Survey|Richard|Green|CIT|We propose to obtain IUE spectrophotometry of very hot degenerate stars and hot low luminosity subdwarfs selected from the > 1000 ultraviolet excess stars discovered in the Palomar-Green survey. These objects require far ultraviolet measurements in order to determine whether stars become degenerate at temperatures much higher than 50,000 K, and whether their progenitors include sdO stars or just planetary nebulae central stars. The IUE spectrophotometry may also reveal resonance line transitions from important elements not previously detected in white dwarfs, but which may be found in the very hot stars. These observations will be augmented with good quality, optical spectrophotometry and model atmospheres analysis already in progress. To study the envelope processes that determine the temperatures and abundances, we propose to observe three classes of objects: 1) the very hottest degenerate stars from the survey; 2) degenerates showing obvious mixed hydrogen and helium atmospheres; and, 3) degenerates with high surface magnetic fields, which produce peculiar, unidentified absorption spectra.|Y
FBBVK|Study of Feige-4|V. G.|Kurt|USSR|On October 1977 the joint Soviet - French scientific team discovered a bright UV-source in the range of wavelengths 600A with the equipment installed on-board the "Prognoz-6" satellite.  A flux observed was about 6 10^-11 erg/ cm^2 sec A. An object proposed for identification of the source is a hot white dwarf FEIGE-4 with the following coordinates: 1950 = 0 17 4; =+ 13 36.  Its temperature is about 100,000K.  The Leiten's list of white dwarfs includes this object (LB433). Its phonographic magnitude equals, to 14^m. 1. Sky maps for its observation were published in Astroph.J.129, 600, 1959. J.Feige.  I believe that this object is similar to the sources HZ 43 and FEIGE-24 which were previously observed by Stewart Boyer during ASTP. As would be very interesting to observe this source by means of your new satellite IUE (Ultraviolet Explorer).  I also sent information on our observations to the IAU Central Telegram Bereau. I am sincerely obliged to you in advance.|Y
FBCAD|Accretion on to White Dwarfs|Andrea K.|Dupree|CFA|We propose to continue observations of accreting white dwarfs, including AM Her and related objects. Our goals are to identify various contributions to the UV continuum and line emission, and to study their time variations with orbital phase of the binary system and with changes in the optical and soft and hard Xray fluxes. We plan to confront these observations with theoretical calculations in an attempt to resolve the discrepancy between the predicted and observed UV flux in AM Her, to understand the relationship between UV and X-ray emission in these objects, and to determine the physical properties of these objects, including their masses, luminosities and distances, and magnetic field strengths.|Y
FBCGW|Ultraviolet Study of Peculiar White Dwarfs|Gary A.|Wegner|Penn State|The stars to be investigated belong to a sample of relatively cool white dwarfs (Teff between 7000 to 9000 K) with peculiar spectra. Most of these objects are either known or are suspected to show bands of the C2 molecule in the visual portion of their spectra. Ultraviolet spectrograms of these stars would help provide information on the presence and abundances of other atomic and molecular species in their atmospheres. More generally, these observations could yield new data on the relative importance of convective mixing, gravitational settling and accretion in the outer layers of the C2 white dwarfs, a topic currently of considerable theoretical interest.|Y
FBCJL|Hot Magnetic White Dwarfs|J. D.|Landstreet|Western Ontario|This proposal describes a continuation of a program of ultraviolet spectroscopy of the symbiotic variables, and the old and recurrent novae. Low, resolution IUE spectra have been obtained which provide both the emission line spectra of tile nebula as well as the continuum of the hot, underlying star. A completion of hie low resolution survey is proposed.  A program of IUE observations of the prototypal symbiotic variable AG Pegasus was initiated in June 1979, and continued in September 1979; additional observations are planned for December 1979, as well as March 1980. Both low and high resolution spectra are being obtained. The line profile and radial velocity variations provide important clues to the distribution of hot gas within the binary. High resolution spectra from the McDonald Observatory arc obtained to complement the IUE spectra; these near infrared data provide the radial velocity of the cool M giants. As the orbital period of the system is approximately 830 days, IUE and McDonald observations are needed in 1980-1981 in order to investigate fully the periodic spectrum variations.  The IUE spectra for other symbiotic are being combined with groundbased observations to determine the physical structure of these peculiar variables.  Low resolution IUE spectra of the novae are being used to derive the chemical composition of the gaseous nebulae.|Y
FBCMS|Spectra of Degenerate Stars of Known Mass|M.|Savedoff|Rochester|Observations of white dwarfs of known mass can be analyzed with maximum information about the system. This condition implies a close companion (usually brighter than the target star), and the concomitant problems of pointing, scattered light, and difficult ground based photometry. We propose to use precision astrometric methods to offset from ~8th magnitude stars within ~8' to minimize the uncertainty in the offset instructions permitting the acquisition of the target within the 3" small aperture. To do absolute spectrophotometry, the target must be observed in the large aperture because the transmission of the small aperture is typically -5 +/- .1 (Bohlin, R.C. et al. 1979). The apparent surface brightness due to scattered light should be the same in both apertures, as long as the primary is kept at the same distance outside the slit edge. By avoiding the primary, we hope to avoid saturation of the tracking system and attendant problems.  Copernicus and prior IUE observations of one such star (Sirius B) already available have demonstrated the usefullness of IUE data for the analysis of the atmosphere of this star. Data of higher quality which we propose to acquire should lead to a clearer picture of the system. With the low and high dispersion spectra, using the small aperture, we should have smaller corrections for the scattered light of the primary. In measuring Sirius B, we will probably have the maximum experience with problems of precision offset observations. Accordingly, we propose to explore similar objects (Procyon B).  Since the reddening is negligible, analysis of absolute spectrophotometric data yields Teff while the 50A wide Ly-alpha line yields g. Since the parallax of Sirius is among the best known, we can obtain R, the radius, from the flux, which combined with g yields the mass. Thus we can examine compatibility of the mass as determined from the theoretical mass-radius relation, from the observed Einstein shift, from spectrophotometry, and from the dynamical orbit. Our group includes persons professionally engaged in discussion of these techniques both theoretical and observational. An examination of the consistency of our material would permit discussion of the determination of the interior composition of these stars. Currently this is a subject of pure speculation, modified only by the requirement that the evolutionary history of these objects and their companions be consistent.|Y
FBCRG|A Study of the Low Luminosity Hot Stars from the Palomar-Green Supply|Richard|Green|Arizona|We propose to continue IUE observations as part of a comprehensive study of very hot degenerate stars and hot, low luminosity subdwarfs. The Palomar-Green survey provides a statistically complete sample of over 2000 ultraviolet excess stars, from which we have drawn a list of rare DO, DAO, DBA, and magnetic degenerates, as well as extreme DAwk and low luminosity subdwarfs. From higher resolution optical data, we derive line profiles giving surface gravities; the combined IUE and optical spectrophotometry yield temperatures accurate to 15,000 K, and abundances for C,N,O and information on the He are obtained from the IUE spectra. A luminosity calibration for each spectral type may then be derived and applied to the complete sample. The general questions to be answered include whether pure helium atmosphere stars have a unique final evolutionary history, which elements are supported by radiation pressure and a what temperature do they sink out, and what is the evolutionary status of the cooler mixed helium and hydrogen atmosphere stars?|Y
FBCSH|Hot, Subluminous Stars and Associated Nebulae|Sara R.|Heap|NASA/GSFC|I propose to continue the previous program, HSSRH, in a study of hot, subluminous stars. This program will concentrate in three areas of study: (1) Search for planetaries (star and nebula) having anomalous ultraviolet flux distributions; (2) Determination of nebular ionic abundances from resonance absorption lines; (3) Determination of rate@ of mass-loss in hot, subluminous stars.  The first area of study requires low-dispersion (usually SWP) spectra, while the latter two areas of study require high-dispersion (usually SWP) spectra.|Y
FBDAH|Phase-Resolved Spectrophotometry of the ZZ Ceti Variable G 29-38|Albert V.|Holm|CSC|IUE low dispersion spectrophotometry will be obtained of the variable white dwarf G29-38 to determine the difference of effective temperature at maximum light from that at minimum. The far ultraviolet flux from stars of the temperature of G20-38 is very sensitive to temperature. By comparing the observed light amplitudes with predicted amplitudes for the observed temperature changes we will have a determination of radius changes during the pulsation. The proposed observations also will give limited information on the relative phases of temperature maximum and light maximum. our results will provide additional criteria for choosing between non-radial pulsation, radial pulsation, and flux redistribution models of this phenomenon. The desired phase information will be obtained despite the shortness of pulsation periods relative to the necessary exposure lengths by repeatedly moving the telescope so that the on-pulse spectrum and the offpulse spectrum are integrated on different locations of the detector. Simultaneous ground-based optical monitoring will be used for exposure metering.|Y
FBDCB|High Dispersion Observation of HZ 43|C. Stuart|Bowyer|Berkeley|We propose to look at the hot white dwarf HZ 43 in the short wavelength high dispersion mode. Our primary purpose is a much more sensitive search for the He II 1640 line (which has not been seen at low dispersion). The He II continuum jump has been observed in the EUV, and knowledge of the 1640 line (even an upper limit) will provide a very important constraint on theoretical determinations of the He distribution in this hydrogen rich object. This distribution provides important information about the gravitational diffusion mechanism presumed to be responsible for the observed appearance of white dwarfs.|Y
FBDCW|UV Observations of the Probable Stellar Remnant of Supernova AD1006|Chi-Chao|Wu|CSC|We propose to observe the blue stellar object near the center of SNR AD1006 with the IUE. It has been suggested to be the stellar remnant of SN AD1006. A good understanding of the nature of this object will help to substantiate or refute the Leventhal-McCall model which predicts that a Type I supernova leaves behind a degenerate dwarf stellar remnant. We also propose to observe approximately 10 early type stars in the neighborhood of SNR AD1006 to establish the reddening law for the region.  The reddening law and the strength of the 2200 A dust absorption feature will be used to correct for the reddening and to estimate the E(B-V) and distance of this blue star. The IUE data will be complemented by the Hale Observatories' Multi-Channel Spectrophotometric Scanner data. model atmospheres will be computed to fit the flux distribution from 1150 to 10,000 A and the HI Ly-alpha profile to derive the effective temperature and surface gravity. If the distance can be determined with a reasonable accuracy, the mass and radius of the object can be established. Curve of growth and/or spectral synthesis techniques will be used to study the elemental abundances.|Y
FBDJL|UV Spectrophotometry of the Magnetic White Dwarf GD 229|J. D.|Landstreet|Western Ontario|The magnetic white dwarf GD 229 is unique in showing a visible spectrum which contains several exceedingly strong absorption bands of completely unknown origin. IUE short and long wavelength spectra obtained earlier this year, although somewhat underexposed, indicate that this star probably has an atmosphere which is hydrogen deficient. The UV spectra also show tantalizing hints of strong absorption features. I propose to obtain well-exposed LWR and SWP spectra of this star to improve the signal-to-noise ratio in the absorption features and clarify their reality, together with comparison spectra of a number of (previously unobserved) normal DA and DB white dwarfs of similar temperature.|Y
FBDRG|Very Hot Pre-Degenerate & Mixed Atmosphere Subdwarfs from the Palomar-Green Survey|Richard F.|Green|U Arizona|We propose to obtain ultraviolet spectrophotometry for two groups of rare, hot stars: candidates for the hottest measured photospheric temperatures, which along with planetary nebula nuclei, define the left-hand edge of the HR diagram; and cooler stars with mixed hydrogen and helium atmospheres and uncertain surface gravities. The results will be combined with energy distributions from the Palomar multi-channel spectrophotometer and high dispersion optical spectra, and interpreted with current model atmospheres to yield temperatures, gravities, and abundance estimates. This group is part of a complete statistical sample, so that the physical calibration can then permit a calculation of the space density of the objects. The ultimate goal is the determination of the evolutionary status of these peculiar "hot subdwarfs", their connection with the horizontal branch and planetary nebulae, and the fate of helium in the atmosphere in the pre-degenerate phase.|Y

FBEAH|Phase-Resolved Spectrophotometry of the ZZ Ceti Variable G29-38|Albert V.|Holm|CSC|We will continue to explore the physical mechanisms responsible for the ZZ Ceti phenomenon. In our IUE fourth-year program we obtained phase-resolved spectra of G29-38 in the 1200 A to 2000 A.  A range which showed that the pulsation amplitude is larger in the ultraviolet than in the visual and that there is a local minimum in the pulsation amplitude near 1700 A with the amplitude increasing both towards 1200A and towards 2000 A Our interpretation of -this observation is that the mechanism which drives the pulsation is the change in hydrogen opacity with temperature. We intend to obtain phase-resolved spectra of G29-38 in the 2000 A to 3200 A range to confirm our results. The desired phase information will be obtained despite the shortness of the pulsation periods by repeatedly moving the telescope so that the on-pulse spectrum and the off-pulse spectrum are integrated on different locations of the detector. Simultaneous ground-based optical monitoring will be used for exposure metering. This technique was successful in our fourth-year program.  One other interesting result of our G29-38 observations is that the star has strong absorption features at 1390 A and at 1600A.  We will obtain non-phase resolved spectra of one other ZZ Ceti variable and one non-variable white dwarf to explore the possibility that the unknown agents response for these features might also be involved in the unstability of these white dwarf atmospheres.|Y
FBPBB|Pulsationally Induced Mass-Dumping in F + B Binaries|Bernard W.|Bopp|U Toledo|The unusual binary system HD 207739, comprised of a tidally distorted F8 supergiant and an obscured hot non-degenerate star, is presently in a state of episodic mass dumping onto an accretion shell around the hot component. The UV behavior of HD 207739 has been puzzling, since there is no correlation of the f lux variations with phase of the 141 day orbit. However, IUE data obtained in 1990 show the obscuration of the hot component in HD 207739 to have a 50 day Periodicity during which most of the UV flux diminishes rapidly by a factor of 2-3, then gradually brightens. We interpret the 50 period as the pulsation period of the F-star, and conclude that mass exchange in the system is accomplished through a mechanism of periodic Roche surface overflow, driven by pulsation. This phenomenon has been suggested to occur in other interacting systems (e.g. , RX Cas), but our observations represent an important confirmation of the idea of pulsationally driven mass transfer.  Prior IUE and optical campaigns have identified several other systems with characteristics similar to HD 207739. We propose to obtain systematic observations of these systems to examine whether their UV variability indicates that episodic, pulsationally driven mass dumping occurs. The IUE observations will be coordinated with ground-based optical photometry and spectroscopy.|Y

FDJJL|First Observations of the Pleiades Transition Region Line Emission|Jeffrey L.|Linsky|Colorado - JILA|Nearby clusters, such as Ursa Major and the Hyades, have already been studied with the IUE. However, the younger, fainter Pleiades cluster, which contains the youngest, and presumably most active, main sequence stars in the solar vicinity, remains to be observed and analyzed. Observations of such young clusters provide the best method of studying the evolution of stellar parameters as stars age an the main sequence.  Hence, we propose to make the first study of the transition region emission of a small, carefully chosen sample of X-ray bright late F-type stars from the Pleiades, thereby extending the main sequence baseline for the transition region activity-age relation over more than 2 orders of magnitude.  We expect to determine a.) whether or not there is indeed a plateau of activity extending to ages as young as that of the Pleiades, b.) what the resulting exponential decay time is for the transition region line emission, c.) if there is still a dependence on the Rossby number for such young stars, and d.) whether or not the plage model explanation is truly unacceptable in this age regime.|Y
FDLTS|Chromospheric Activity in the Early F Stars|Theodore|Simon|Hawaii|Existing IUE observations have established that virtually all of the early F dwarf stars show stronger chromospheric and transition region emission than do the cooler and more deeply convective dwarf stars like the Sun. The observations suggest that this activity may reach a peak near spectral type FO V before vanishing among the early and mid A-type stars. In addition, the activity of the early F stars shows no dependence on rotation rate, and therefore may arise in a fundamentally different way, than the dynamodriven magnetic activity of the cooler stars. The most likely source of chromospheric heating in the early-type dwarfs is the shock dissipation of acoustic waves. To test this explanation, I am proposing new observations to determine whether the apparent peak in activity near FO V is real and whether the activity of the early F stars is uncorrelated with the rotation rate down to very low values of v sin i. The observations will also test whether the early F stars commonly show a deficiency in X ray emission relative to their UV emission, as recent work suggests. If confirmed, this result would provide strong circumstantial evidence that the coronae of the early F stars are heated by acoustic waves and that these stars possess strong coronal winds.|Y

FEGMP|Two Iron Stars|Mirek J.|Plavec|UCLA|I propose to study the stars XX Ophiuchi and BD+14 3887. Both stars show prominent line emission spectra in the optical region. Fe II lines are so conspicuous and abundant in XX Ophiuchi that the star was called an "iron stair" by Merrill. The optical spectrum of BD+14 3887 is similar but its He I emission lines are very conspicuous. XX Ophiuchi is known to have a cool companion; our optical scans indicate that BD+14 3887 may have one, too.  The optical continua of both stars are very peculiar. They are quite continuous across the Balmer discontinuity. Parts of the Paschen continuum can be fitted by a Kurucz model atmosphere for a moderate B star, but then one must postulate a circumstellar optically thin continuous radiation of hydrogen with just the right emission jump at the Balmer limit to fill in the flux drop in the stellar continuum. Alternatively, both objects may be disks, perhaps similar to those we suspect in strongly interacting binaries such as the W Serpentis stars; IUE spectra should decide.  No IUE spectrum exists for BD+14 3887 and I propose to obtain at least a LWR spectrum. The available IUE spectra for XX Ophiuchi are underexposed, but they suggest that satisfactory lowdispersion spectra can be obtained in both cameras. They also indicate that XX Ophiuchi may be akin to the W Serpentis stars, but at the same time raise interesting questions as to the nature of the emission lines seen in the SWP camera.  I expect to get some idea about the nature of the objects, in particular whether they are interacting binaries or rather interacting with the surrounding interstellar medium (they lie in heavily obscured areas).  The project can be realized in one IUE shift, but it must be a US1 shift because of the length of the exposures.|Y
FEHTA|How Steady are the Far-Ultraviolet Emissions of the F Stars?|Thomas R.|Ayres|Colorado-LASP|A detailed monitoring of the ultraviolet spectrum of the active F-type giant of Capella ( alpha Aur A: G6 III + F9 III) over the course of two months in the Spring of 1981 revealed that fluctuations in the high-excitation emissions like C IV 1548 were remarkably small, in fact below the sensitivity limit of the IUE echelle images taken during the program. The steadiness of the C IV flux of Capella was quite surprising, given the rather dramatic variations of highexcitation emissions seen in other stars of comparable C IV and X-ray intensity levels, particularly the cool K0 subgiants of the RS CVn-type binaries.  Recently, M. Giampapa and R. Rosner have argued that the F-stars should he comparatively steady in their chromospheric and coronal emissions compared with the cooler late-type stars, because the shallow convective envelopes of the Ftypes are not conducive to the development of large, spatially-coherent structures of the internal magnetic field. It is the eruption of the subsurface fields into large, organized, long-lived active regions which is thought to be responsible for the substantial "rotational modulations" of the ultraviolet emissions of the cooler stars.  If the Giampapa-Rosner mechanism is correct, then steady far-ultraviolet emissions should be a trade-mark of the F-stars. I propose to test that hypothesis by a very sensitive monitoring of the C IV emission of three prototype F-stars: Procyon (F5 IV-V), the secondary of Capella (F9 III), and a Cassiopeia (F2 IV).|Y
FEJRR|IUE Spectra of AGN with Strong Fe II Emission|Ronald A.|Remillard|Massachusetts Institute of Technology|Our optical investigations of HEAO-I X-ray positions are producing many discoveries of bright AGN, and a substantial fraction (20%) exhibit very strong Fe II emission at optical wavelengths. Followup studies with EXOSAT and results from the Einstein Observatory date bank indicate that several AGN with extreme Fe II emission have steep X-ray spectra. The energy index (alpha x) is frequently In the range of 1.0 to 2.0, which Is more typical of BL Lac objects than Seyfert Galaxies or QSO's, for which alpha x ~ 0. 7.  Several studies have attempted to determine the relation between the continuum shape and the emission-line spectra in active galaxies. A correlation between steep X-ray spectra and strong optical Fe II emission Is contrary to some expectations. For example, strong Fe II emission requires optically thick material that Is able to shield the Fe atoms from further Ionization; however, model computations by Gullbert at al. (1983) indicate that the 'two-phase instability' (i.e. a tenuous, hot gas that confines the dense, cool clouds emitting the broad emission lines) requires a flat ionizing spectrum. An alternative view would treat the continuum and line emission in a more unified model (e.g. Blandford 1985) in which enhanced Fe II emission and a steep X-ray continuum could arise in a thickened (torroidal?) accretion disk created by a high accretion rate. Still another possibility is that there is some connection between the continuum emission of the strongest Fe II emitters and BL Lac objects. The latter question arises when the I Zw 1 'subclass* is considered (i.e. AGN distinguished by very strong Fe II emission, very weak forbidden lines, and relatively narrow H lines). Two such objects (PKS0558-504 and I Zw 1 itself) are now known to have steep Xray spectra; several observers have noted the similarity between I Zw 1 types and BL Lac's in infrared continuum studies; and at least two QSO's that resemble I Zw 1 are optically polarized (blazars).  IUE spectra would be of great value in the effort to sort out and attempt to explain these correlations and associations. Only 9 of the 24 strongest Fe II emitting AGN have been measured with IUE, and none of these are X-ray selected objects. IUE measurements of the UV spectral index will complement the X-ray information, providing a more complete description of the ionizing continuum. The derived continuum and emission-line parameters will be combined with published information for the 9 previously observed cases to further define the class properties of the AGN with the strongest Fe II, as well as those that specifically resemble I Zw 1.|Y
FEOJB|Fe Line Diagnostics of Multiply Shocked Stellar Atmospheres: The Mira S Carinae|Jay A.|Bookbinder|Harvard CFA - SAO|Results from our previous IUE programs indicate that Mira atmospheres - and their responses to the propagating shock - are far more complex than previously thought.  Of potentially great utility for studying the shocks in Mira atmospheres, we have recently determined that many Fe II features apparently show strongly phase dependent features such as velocity shifts, lines asymmetries, and variable intensities; all of these effects are occurring as the shock evolves on very short timescales. Furthermore, the Fe II lines appear to be significant sources of cooling for the shocked atmosphere, with radiative losses exceeding those of the Mg II lines for much of the shock cycle.  The range of heights at which possible fluorescing material exists, combined with the complex velocity fields which occur in the outer atmospheres of Miras and the sensitivity of line fluorescence processes to the precision and nature of the overlap between the pump and the pumped line(s), provides a wondrous opportunity to probe that velocity field. A careful study of the fluoresced FeII lines as a function of the pulsation phase, combined with a knowledge of the pumping transitions, will yield detailed information on the velocity structure of the outer layers of a shocked atmosphere which is obtainable in no other way.|Y
FERFB|Multifrequency Observations and Variability of Blazars|Frederick C.|Bruhweiler|Catholic University|In simultaneous multifrequency observations just completed, we were very successful in catching Mkn 421 during an extremely energetic gamma-ray flare.  The simultaneous detection of ultrahigh energy gammarays (10 eV) in Mkn 421 from the ground, presents a severe challenge to relativistic beaming models for blazars. The Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO) has detected a class of strong gamma-ray emitting quasars and BL Lacs (collectively called blazars). Simultaneous multifrequency observations spanning the entire electromagnetic spectrum from gamma-rays through radio waves are crucial to properly test models attempting to describe the large gamma-ray fluxes.  We will continue to use the IUE to monitor and obtain instantaneous flux distributions for the gamma-ray selected blazars, Mkn 421, 3C 273, and 3C 279. This is a part of a rigorous multifrequency campaign using the EUVE, ASCA, and CGRO spacecraft, as well as ground-based radio, IR, optical, and even Cerenkov detectors. We will obtain time variability information through observations at 1-2 day intervals, These will be used to determine the frequency dependence, timescale, and time-lag of any variability. In the process we will also acquire instantaneous flux distributions (snapshots) of these blazars. This campaign, in which the IUE plays a fundamental role, will provide strong constraints for theoretical models trying to describe some of the most energetic processes observed in the Universe.|Y
FERWZ|UV Spectra for Super Fe II-Emitters|Wei|Zheng|Johns Hopkins University|As part of our multi-band study of a rare group of AGN which show extremely strong optical Fe  II emission, we propose to obtain the UV spectra of four super Fe II-emitters, which are selected from an IRAS survey of more than 500 candidates.  The IUE spectra will enable us to construct the energy distribution from UV to far-infrared. These objects are highly reddened due to dust, and so the far-UV flux may suggest a separate component of unreddened scattered light, providing clues to the geometry of the obscured central region. The IUE spectra of a like object, IRAS 0759+651, show significant broad absorption in Ly-alpha Si IV, C IV, and Mg II. If broad absorption is observed in our proposed targets, Fe II emission may be linked to violent supermassive starburst which produce an expanding shell and dust obscuration. We will test an assumption that starburst may be a significant factor in these super Fe II-emitters.|Y

These are needed (1) to determine the strengths of the time-dependent and the time independent components of the high temperature spectral I Ines (e.g.  Si IV, CIV) previously detected, to distinguish shock emission from lines originating in a wind or steady state transition region; (2) to check for coronal emission (e.g. FeXI) and other indicators of high temperatures, to determine the maximum temperature present in the atmosphere; (3) to use these lines to derive emission measures hence limits on the transition region density and thickness and/or the wind mass loss rate; and (4) to measure or find upper limits for free-free continuum emission in the 1200-1600A region.|Y
FGLWF|FG Sagittae and Its Planetary Nebula|Walter A.|Feibelman|NASA/GSFC|FG Sge with its surrounding planetary nebula He 1-5 (-PK 60 -701) represents a unique object believed to be in a brief transitory phase of a thermal pulse. The star brightened from 13.5m in 1894 to 9.6m around 1970 and then declined slightly. During that time the spectral type changed from B4 I to F6 Ib. Several IUE LWP low-dispersion spectra exist, but no SWP image of sufficient length has ever been taken to reveal the presence of a hot companion that is required to ionize the moderately high excitation planetary nebula. FG Sge shows evidence of highly processed material in the optical region and thus represents an extremely rare observational phase of stellar evolution,|Y

We want to observe additional F and early G giants in order to better understand which heating mechanism(s) are responsible for the heating of the transition layers. We also want to determine N/C and Si/C abundance ratios which appear to be abnormal for several F giants in contradiction to theoretical expectations.|Y
FGPEG|FG Sagittae: Stellar Evolution - Caught in the Act!|Edward F.|Guinan|Villanova University|We propose to obtain several IUE spectra of the post ABG star FG Sge while it is undergoing its recent rapid evolutionary stage. The IUE observations will be supported by UBVRI photoelectric photometry as well as infrared observations. During August through November 1992, this remarkable star rapidly decreased in brightness, declining from V- +9.2 mag to V - +13.5 mag. Over the same time interval, FG Sge became bluer, with U-B and B-V indices decreasing by 1.40 mag and 0.80 mag, respectively. Iben and Livio have suggested that past bizarre behavior of FG Sge and its recent dramatic dimming are explained by its rapid evolution from a post AGB star to a planetary nebula/white dwarf. According to this scenario, the star ejected a shell of gas (and dust) and that while its V-mag decreases much of the energy will be shifted to the UV as the star itself becomes hotter. Observations of FG Sge at this time offer an unprecedented opportunity to observe an extremely brief, but important phase of stellar evolution in which a hot subdwarf/planetary nebula stage begins|Y

FKFJL|High Resolution Spectroscopy of Two FK Comae Stars|Jeffrey L.|Linsky|Colorado - JILA|The FK Comae stars are a class of extremely rapidly rotating G-K giants that exhibit among the brightest UV and X-ray emission seen in late type stars. Previous IUE and optical observations have indicated that the activity (the extreme surface fluxes) in FK Comae may be qualitatively different from that in "normal" late type stars, and that the other four members of the class are far less bizarre than FK Comae itself. A definitive method for determining the structure of the outer atmospheres of these stars, and deciding whether the heating mechanism is normal chromospheric heating or accretion heating is by analysis of high resolution SWP spectra. We propose, in collaboration with S. Rucinski, to obtain 16-20 hour collaborative NASA-ESA SWP-HI spectra of FK Comae, which exhibits Hot and MgII line widths of  500 kms^-1, and HD 36705, which appears to be a far less bizarre member of this class. These observations would be the first high dispersion SWP spectra ever obtained of FK Comae stars.|Y
FKJFW|Spectral Imaging of HD199178|Frederick M.|Walter|Colorado - CASA|We propose to model the Mg II variability of HD 199178, the brightest FK Comae star, by analyzing a large number of well-exposed LWP-HI spectra distributed uniformly over the 3.337 day rotation period. These observations will be coupled with simultaneous optical Doppler imaging. HD 199178 is an excellent candidate for modeling since we know its inclination (79 degrees) from our optical polarimetry, which reveals a scattering patch leading the presumed hot spot. Our previous IUE observations, coupled with the archive images, indicate that the ultraviolet emission increases at maximum light, supporting the hot spot model. Our September 1986 IUE observations, while lacking in phase coverage, revealed an interesting Mg II k emission line profile variability with phase. We feel that this star should be studied more carefully, since it might help us to understand this unique phase of stellar evolution. Archival spectra will be coupled with the new observations to study long-term variability.|Y
FKLCA|Evolution in FK Vomae Stars|Carol W.|Ambruster|Villanova|We propose IUE observations of a recently discovered FK Comae-type star, 1E1751+7046, whose Vsini of 30-40 km s^-1 suggests that it may be an older, spun-down member of a class which at present contains only 3 probable members. FK Com stars are believed to result from the coalescing of the two stars in a W UMa binary, and it is this process which accounts for their extraordinary activity levels. Since the W UMa phase itself lasts only ~10^8 yr, the coalescence phase probably is remarkably brief, as magnetic braking slows the rapid rotation and the star becomes indistinguishable from an ordinary cool giant. The lowering of the activity level should be seen first in the corona and transition region, thus the proposed IUE and radio observations offer a unique opportunity to test this remarkable stage of stellar evolution.|Y
FKLJL|Ultraviolet Observations of Two Possible FK Comae Stars|Jeffrey L.|Linsky|Colorado - JILA|The controversial and rare class of FK Comae stars may be examples of a brief stage of low-mass binary evolution: the point at which the two cores of a contact binary merge to form a single star. At present, there are four members of the class (although the appropriateness of FK Comae as a prototype has been questioned). Optical follow-up observations of the serendipitous X-ray detections contained in the Einstein Observatory Extended Medium Sensitivity Survey (EMSS) have revealed two new candidates for the FK Comae class.  Ultraviolet observations of the known FK Comae stars show that their chromospheric and transition region line fluxes are relatively stronger than those of active binaries such as the RS CVn and W UMa types. Ultraviolet observations of the two candidates from the EMSS could help to verify their status as FK Comae stars. We propose to make two LWP (high- and low-resolution) and one low-resolution SWP observation of the brighter of the two candidates in order to measure its O I, Si II, C II, He II, C IV, N V, and Mg II emission line fluxes. In addition, we will use the high-resolution Mg II h & k line profiles to study the kinematics of the chromosphere and compare it to the kinematical information obtained from photospheric lines, as well as look for evidence of an excretion disk. This, in addition to one low-resolution LWP exposure of the fainter candidate, form a core proposal of 2 US1 shifts and 1 half US2 shift which is extremely feasible for the IUE to observe.  We also ask for an additional US1 shift and US2 half shift as part of a supplemental proposal to obtain a high-resolution LWP exposure of the fainter candidate. We realize, based upon previous observations of other stars which may be similar in nature, that such an exposure (10 hours maximum) will probably be insufficient to meet the objectives listed above. However, since such reasoning precludes the chance to make an unusual discovery and since the potential for finding unusually strong chromospheric exists, we have decided to ask for the time. We will not be surprised if the supplemental proposal is not granted, but are confident in the merits of the core proposal.|Y
FKMCA|The Evolution of Coalescence: Spun Down FK Comae Stars|Carol W.|Ambruster|Villanova|FK Com stars, single subgiants or giants characterized by very high rotational velocities (50-200 km s^-1) and extraordinary activity and variability levels, are currently understood to be coalescing or very recently coalesced stars. They are also very rare: only 4 stars are currently accepted members, and their space density is estimated at ~ 2xlO^-8pc^-3. Their most likely progenitors, the W UMa contact binaries are, however, rather common, with a space density -- 1xl0^-4 pc^-3. Thus stars must pass through the coalescence phase and spin down through expansion and stellar winds, very rapidly, ending up as seemingly ordinary slowly rotating giants.  The extraordinary activity, including evidence for an excretion disk, is most evident in high dispersion spectra of the Mg II h and k lines (where photospheric contamination is minimized). Two of the four FK Corn stars lack LWP-Hi spectra: 1E1751+7O46 and NGC 188 I-1. Because variability is so characteristic of the 'younger' FK Com stars (FK Com and HD 199178), we request IUE time to obtain two LWP-Hi exposures each of the two spun down FK Com stars, 1E1751+7046 (Vsini = 30-40 km s^-1) and NGC 188 I-1 (Vsini = 24 km s^-1) in order to trace the evolution of chromospheric activity as the stars adjust to the coalesced state. NGC 188 I-1 is a particularly important and exciting target: because of its established membership near the center of the old open cluster NGC 188, it is the only coalesced star with a known age, luminosity and distance. Thus it is uniquely important, not just for its magnetic activity, but for studies of stellar evolution.|Y
FKNRR|Structure and Dynamics of HD32918|Richard D.|Robinson|CSC - GHRS|The star HD32918 is a member of the class of rapidly rotating, apparently single giants collectively called the FK Comae stars. HD32918 is one of the most active members of this group and has shown remarkable changes in its atmospheric structure, the most significant being indicated by the change in Ho from an approximately symmetric emission profile in Dec 1980 to an inverse P Cyg profile in Aug 1987. The IUE observations proposed here are planned as part of a major observational campaign designed to understand the atmospheric structure of this star as well. as changes in that structure over both short and long timescales. Particular attention will be paid to the characteristics of the long lasting starspot region known to be present on the star.|Y

IUE time is requested to monitor the UV emission lines of the transition region and upper chromosphere contemporaneously with ASCA X-ray spectroscopy of coronal emission. The IUE data complement the          X-ray data by providing lower temperature diagnostics and their rotational (or other temporal) modulation. Ground-based spectroscopic monitoring will also be provided. Data will be compared to previous IUE, ROSAT, and visual data.|Y

FSCJL|Collaborative Monitoring of a Flare and By DRA Variable Star|Jeffery L.|Linsky|Colorado|BY Dra is the prototype and brightest member of a subgroup of the dMe flare stars which exhibit quasiperiodic low amplitude light variations. The BY Dra syndrome, as discussed by Kunkel (1975), may be explained by starspots covering large fractions of a hemisphere which are 500-1500 K cooler than the visible photosphere, and which produce the photometric variations due to rotational modulation. These stars flare most often when the spots are on the visible hemisphere. We propose to monitor BY Dra throughout one cycle of variability (about 3.8 days) by means of 80 continuous hours of IUE timetrailed low dispersion spectroscopy (using the SWP and LWR cameras alternatively), ground-based photometry at Catania and Kitt Peak (to monitor photometric variations), ground-based time-trailed spectroscopy at Kitt Peak, and other coordinated observations. Our objective is to model the properties of the outer atmospheres in quiet regions, spot regions, and during flares separately.|Y

FSEJL|Coordinated Observations of Flares on UV Ceti-Type Stars|Jeffrey L.|Linsky|Colorado|We propose to monitor 2 UV Ceti-type flare stars at times of maximum flare activity simultaneously in the ultraviolet (IUE), X-rays (the EXOSAT satellite to be launched by ESA in early 1982), optical, and radio portions of the spectrum. The objectives of this coordinated program are: (1) to estimate the energy budget for a typical sample of flares including radiative losses from the corona (X-rays), conductive loss to the transition region and chromosphere (ultraviolet and optical), and expansion (optical spectra); (2) to determine whether flares are cooled primarily by radiation, conduction, or expansion; (3) to estimate the temperatures, densities, and volumes of the hot flaring plasma, (4) to study the correlation of optical and radio flares, and (5) to deter-mine the mechanism by which the ultraviolet flare continuum is formed. We request 6 US#2 shifts to obtain low dispersion SWP and LWR spectra either by discrete time trailing along the aperture or individual spectra depending on exposure times and background levels. A very successful coordinated observation of the August 20, 1980 flare on Prox Cen using IUE and Einstein demonstrates the feasibility of this type of coordinated observing program.|Y
FSESB|Stellar Flares|Sallie L.|Baliunas|CFA|Flares on dMe stars have been observed In optical continuum radiation for many years. IUE has made it possible to observe these flares in ultraviolet emission lines and continuum. We wish to monitor two stars in both the ultraviolet and optical spectrum regions to study the energy released by flares and the nature of the continuum radiation. We will employ density diagnostics and emission measure analysis techniques developed for solar observations. The He II A 1840 line will be used to infer the flare luminosity at 56 < hv < 100 eV.|Y
FSETA|The Many Faces of HR 1099|Thomas R.|Ayres|Colorado|We propose to monitor, in high-dispersion, the far-ultraviolet emission of the archetype short-period RS Canum Venaticorum binary system, HR 1099 = V711 Tauri (K0 IV + G5 V) through two complete orbital revolutions. The tidally-locked RS CVn binaries have among the brightest chromospheres (T = 6000 K) and coronae (T ~ 10^6 K) known, and are thought to suffer intense magnetic activity in their surface layers. Accordingly, RS CVn binaries, as a class, are valuable prototypes for investigating how magnetic flux is generated in rapidly-rotating convective stars; the spatial scales associated with structural expressions of the surface fields (magnetic active regions, for example); and general questions concerning the physical response of atmospheric plasma to embedded, intense magnetic activity.  Our objective in monitoring HR 1099 throughout its orbit is to study the spatial distribution of far-ultraviolet emission on all faces of the active K0 subgiant in that system. Previous exploratory spectra obtained at critical orbital phases, namely the opposite quadratures, indicate that the cool subgiant is quite variable in its far-ultraviolet output, and suggests that the emission has a rather patchy surface distribution. We propose to obtain further observations in order to characterize the spatial scales and brightness levels of large, coherent active regions on the stellar surface. Central to our study is the issue of whether the dark "starspots", thought responsible for the low-amplitude, periodic photometric fluctuations in such systems, are sites of enhanced farultraviolet emission, as the solar analogs--active regions--might tend to suggest. Since the emission features from any large-scale activity center will be spread out in velocity by the rapid rotation of the tidally synchronized subgiant, high-dispersion spectroscopy can be utilized to diagnose what fraction of the stellar surface is involved. Furthermore, a sequence of IUE high-dispersion images with the long- and shortwavelength echelles over the binary orbit can help establish more firmly the contribution of the main-sequence component of HR 1099 to the composite emission spectrum. The former observation is relevant to the mechanisms that amplify magnetic fields in the stellar convection zone and impress large-scale spatial coherence on emerging flux ropes. The latter observation is relevant to the mechanisms that generate magnetic flux (dynamo action for example), since the primary and secondary of HR 1099 have somewhat different stellar properties and linear rotation rates.  An investigation of these issues is central to understanding the extremely energetic phenomena associated with the intense surface magnetic activity of the RS CVn subgiants.|Y
FSFBH|Temporal Evolution of UV Emission Lines During Flares on DME Stars|Bernhard M.|Haisch|Lockheed|We propose to observe two UV Ceti-type flare stars to obtain discrete, time trailed spectra of stellar flares. Simultaneous optical photometry and spectrophotometry will be carried out; in addition, by the time of the proposed observations (March 1984), both EXOSAT and ASTRO-B will be fully operational and either open to guest observing programs or otherwise available for collaborative programs. With or without simultaneous X-ray observations we propose to address some of the following Issues: (1) Can flare line emissions be explained by current flaring loop models? (2) How do UV lines evolve during flares? in comparison with optical lines? in comparison with the UV or optical continuum? (3) what is the nature of the UV continuum observed by IUE during previous flares? (4) What is the strength of the chrormospheric flare in Mg II? (5) How does the coronal radiation-sensitive He II 1640 A flare line compare to other UV lines? how does it evolve? and (6) Can a close analog be found in the SMM data met for any observed stellar flare?|Y
FSFMG|Observations of Flare Activity on Selected DME Flare Stars|Mark s.|Giampapa|Aura|Optical and ultraviolet spectroscopy can enable the assessment of the physical conditions characterizing a stellar flare atmosphere and thereby potentially elucidate the possible radiative and hydrodynamic transport mechanisms operative during stellar flares. Observations of flares on M dwarf stars offers the opportunity to obtain detailed information on a solar-like phenomenon as it presumably occurs on many stars, but can presently only be observed on the cool dMe stars due to the highly favorable contrast between the UV and near UV bright flare emission and the faint quiescent background. We therefore propose to acquire timeresolved, low dispersion, large aperture SWP and LWR observations simultaneously with moderate resolution (3-4A) spectrophotometric optical observations of stellar flare events. We also will attempt to coordinate simultaneous VLA (radio corona) observations. We intend to monitor two highly flare active systems; the binary UV Ceti (GL65AB) system and the single flare star YZ CMi (GL 285).  We wish to ascertain the dominant radiative transport mechanism that gives rise to the UV and optical continuum emission during flares as well as assess the relative energy balance in these wavelength regions. Furthermore, we will utilize density diagnostics and emission mesure analysis techniques developed for solar observations. In addition, we will infer flare X-ray luminosities from the enhancement of the He II 1640 recombination line. The UV data and inferred X-ray data will ultimately be used to determine the applicability of flare loop models. All data obtained in this program will be used as input for the construction of semiempirical flare atmospheres.|Y
FSGBH|Coordinated Observations of Strllar Flares|Bernhard M.|Haisch|Lockheed|We are proposing to observe four UV Ceti-type flare stars to obtain discrete, time resolved spectra of stellar flares. The following coordinated ground-based observations were arranged in collaboration with the Catania group (M. Rodono) and the Armagh group during the previous year: optical photometry and spectrophotometry, and radio monitoring using the VLA, Arecibo, CSIRO and other radio telescopes. Similar arrangements will be made again; ESA and NASA IUE programs will be coordinated; X-ray observations will be requested in separate proposals to be submitted to the EXOSAT guest investigator program and via possible collaboration with ASTRO-B scientists.  We propose to address the following: (1) Can flare line emission be explained by any flare loop models of the sort being developed to interpret SMM solar flares? (2) Can any close empirical analogs be found in SMM observations? (3) How do UV lines evolve during flares? (We have temporal resolution by repositioning the target during a given exposure.) (4) What is the nature of the UV continuum observed previously by IUE during flares? (5) What is the strength of the chromospheric (Mg II) flare? (6) How does the coronal-sensitive He II 1640 A line compare to other UV lines during a flare? How does it evolve? (7) What if; the overall energy balance and budget during a flare? primarily cooled by radiative losses? by conduction of energy to the chromosphere?|Y
FSGKL|IUE and VIA Observations of the Nearby Dwarf M Flare Stars YY Gem, YZ CMI & AD LEO|Kenneth R.|Lang|Tufts University|We! propose simultaneous ultraviolet and radio wavelength observations of the nearby dwarf M stars YY Gem, YZ Cmi and AD Leo which are known to emit frequent and powerful flares. The combined observations will determine physical conditions such as; electron temperature, electron density and magnetic field strength at a variety, of levels in the stellar atmosphere. They will provide valuable new insights to such things as the difference between coronal and chromospheric flares, the flare energy budget, the flare conditions in the transition region and corona, the magnetic field strength and size of the emitter, the response of the stellar atmosphere to nonthermal events, the location of flare energy release, and preburst heating or magnetic changes that may trigger flare emission.|Y
FSHJL|A Phase-Linked Study of Emission Lines in the Flare Star Ev lac|Jeffrey L.|Linsky|Colorado - JILA|The classical flare star and BY Dra variable EV Lac has, in the last decade, produced extraordinarily energetic flares at both optical and X-ray wavelengths which are unmatched among M dwarfs. Two of these flares, including the 13 July 1980 optical superflare (the largest ever observed from an M dwarf), occurred when the dominant starspot group was on the far side of the star.  These flares imply the existence of anomolously intense or large active regions. We propose both LWP and SWP observations of EV Lac at equal intervals of 0.23 in phase for two consecutive 4.37 day periods (9 US2 half shifts) in order to map plage regions on the star. The SWP-LO exposures will in cases of high background be obtained by co-adding shorter exposures. This will result in spectra for every ~0.1 in phase. We will also use the data to compute surface fluxes which will be compared with available chromospheric and transition region surface fluxes from other active and quiescent M dwarfs in search of physical clues to this star's extreme flaring activity. We are submitting a proposal to EXOSAT for observing time during the IUE observations.|Y
FSHKL|Coordinated IUE and VLA Observations of Dwarf M Flare Stars and RS CVN Type Stars|Kenneth R.|Lang|Tufts University|Vie propose simultaneous ultraviolet and radio wavelength observations of nearby dwarf M flare stars and RS CVn type stars. Both types of stars are known to emit slowly varying emission on time scales of 30 to 60 minutes as well as frequent and powerful flares of shorter duration. The combined radio and ultraviolet data will provide new information about the radiation mechanism of the slowly varying emission. The observations will determine physical conditions such as electron temperature, electron density and magnetic field strength at a variety of levels in the stellar atmosphere. They will provide valuable new insights to such things as the difference between coronal and chromospheric flares, the flare energy budget, the flare conditions in the transition region and corona, the magnetic field strength and size of the emitter, the response of the stellar atmosphere to nonthermal events, the location of flare energy release, and preburst heating or magnetic changes that may trigger flare emission.|Y
FSHTA|A Deep SWP Echelle Exposure of a Red Dwarf Flare Star: At Microscopii|Thomas R.|Ayres|Colorado|Among the late-type stars that exhibit prominent chromospheric and coronal activity, the H-alpha emission-line red dwarfs (dMe) fall at the extreme high end of Xray and C IV intensity levels. The extraordinary emission strengths of the dMe stars almost certainly are related to high rates of magnetic field production by the "dynamo" mechanism owing to the extensive convective zones of the low-mass, main-sequence stars. Despite the large intrinsic surface fluxes of the dMe stars in high-excitation emissions like C IV, the observed fluxes at Earth are too small for these objects to be studied with the high dispersion mode of IUE, at least using conventional observing strategies. Nevertheless, high-dispersion observations of other late-type single stars and binary systems have provided a wealth of information concerning the physical conditions and dynamics of the important "transition zone" between the lowexcitation chromospheric layers and the overlying, multimillion degree corona.  We therefore propose an IUE observing program to attempt high-dispersion, far-ultraviolet spectroscopy of a prototype flare-star binary, AT Mic AR (dM4.5e + dM4.5e), using a novel observing strategy.  The goals of our program are threefold: - To measure at high dispersion the line profiles of prominent emissions in the far-ultraviolet spectrum of the main-sequence, M-type flare star AT Mic B inside and outside of flares.  - To separately determine the emission levels of the two nearly identical components of the AT Mic binary.  - Test whether a novel observing technique can extend IUE exposures to as long as 30 hours.  Our program is designed to push IUE to its observational limits, and, if successful, will pave the way for much deeper IUE exposures than heretofore have been considered practical. Furthermore, the program will provide high quality UV line profile information for the latest-type main-sequence star(s) that are accessible to the IUE in high dispersion, and will thereby fill an important gap in the existing data base of echelle observations of cool stars.|Y
FSIJL|Mass Motions During a Major Flare on AD Leonis|Jeffery L.|Linsky|Colorado|There have been no studies of mass motions during flares on M dwarf flare stars with IUE because there are no high dispersion observations of a flare. The main obstacles have been practical: flares cannot be accurately predicted, and large flares are relatively infrequent for most stars. A recent statistical analysis of ~200 optical flares on the classical flare star AD Leo, however, shows that this star produces one major (10' erg) flare (often lasting ~1 hr) every 19.2 hr; this is a factor three higher than for any other known flare star. AD Leo has also produced at least 2 large flares during IUE observations, including an extraordinary 4.5 mag 'superflare' on 12 April 1985.  AD Leo, therefore, represents an excellent, and probably unique, opportunity to obtain a high dispersion flare spectrum (LWP) while IUE is still alive. To be certain (at the 90% level ) of obtaining a flare, we request 2 US1 and 1 US2 shifts (2 contiguous ESA shifts are being requested by B. Pettersen), for a total of 40 hr of continuous observing. Extensive coverage at other wavelengths is planned. Because AD Leo is a particularly bright, variable and active X-ray source, should there be unscheduled time available in early April 1986, we strongly request consideration for this time in order to have coordinated X-ray observations by EXOSAT while this satellite is still operational.|Y
FSIKL|Simultaneous IUE and VLA Observations of Dwarf M Flare Stars and RS CVN Type Stars|Kenneth R.|Lang|Tufts University|We propose simultaneous ultraviolet and radio wavelength observations of nearby dwarf M flare stars and RS CVn type stars. Both types of stars are known to emit slowly varying emission on time scales of 30 to 60 minutes as well as frequent and powerful flares of shorter duration. The combined radio and ultraviolet data will provide new information about the radiation mechanism of the slowly varying emission. The VLA data may provide evidence for coherent radiation mechanisms for both the slowly varying emission and stellar bursts, thereby specifying the magnetic field strength and electron density in the stellar coronae. Both the IUE and the VLA data can establish the presence of magnetic fields and a thermal plasma located between the binary components of RS CVn stars. Observations of rapid variations will provide stringent limits to the linear size of the stellar emitter. The proposed simultaneous IUE and VLA observations will determine physical conditions such as electron temperature, electron density and magnetic field strength at a variety of levels in the stellar atmosphere. They will provide valuable new insights to such things as the difference between coronal and chromospheric flares, the flare energy budget, the flare conditions in the transition region and corona, the magnetic field strength and size of the emitter, the response of the stellar atmosphere to nonthermal events, the location of flare energy release, and preburst heating or magnetic changes that may trigger flare emission.|Y
FSJCA|Simultaneous IUE and Magnetic Field Observations of HD 17433|Carol W.|Ambruster|Colorado - JILA|The young, active G9 spectroscopic binary HD 17433 is one of the most interesting stars for which a direct magnetic field and filling factor has been measured (1800 gauss covering 40% of the stellar surface). The age of this star is -2 x 10^8 yr, based on its strong Li line, and is the youngest star observed so far for magnetic fields. Starspot modulation has been observed, and one flare has been reported. H-alpha is variable between emission and absorption on timescales of days. We request the first half of 5 US2 shifts during mid-September to midOctober 1987 to coincide with 5 magnetic field measurements. The main goal of the observations will be to look for correlations between changes in the magnetic field or filling factor and changes in the fluxes of transition region and chromospheric lines, such have been recently found for the young G8 dwarf Xi Boo A. The latter observations are the first direct confirmation of the role of magnetic heating in the atmospheres of cool dwarfs.|Y
FSKJL|Simultaneous Multiwavelength Observations of Stellar Flares|Jeffrey L.|Linsky|Colorado - JILA|We request IUE observations as a major portion of a coordinated observing program to study flares on dMe stars simultaneously at X-ray, ultraviolet, optical and radio wavelengths. Three well-known flare stars (GL 182 - V1005 Ori, Gl 206 - Ross 42, and GI 207.1 - V371 Ori) located near 5 Right Ascension and 30 Declination have been selected so as to permit 8 hours per night uninterrupted viewing by the IUE and GINGA satellites and optical and radio observatories in Europe and South Africa. Observing campaigns with this broad spectral coverage are rare and exceedingly valuable. One of our scientific goals is to assess the energy budget of flares including the prompt (presumably nonthermal) X-rays, the decay phase soft X-ray radiation from the flare loops, and the heating of the lower layers (detected as optical and ultraviolet radiation) as a result of high energy particle streams, blast waves, or reprocessed X-radiation. This task is important to help identify the mechanisms responsible for different aspects of a flare and to confirm or refute the hypothesis that flares of all sizes are responsible for the timeaveraged X-ray luminosity of dMe stars. A second goal is to study the time variation of these different aspects of flares using those data (optical, X-ray, and radio) that do have high time resolution. We will model the chromospheric and transition region layers during and outside of flares using an emission measure analysis of the ultraviolet emission lines observed by IUE.|Y
FSKSS|Temporal Variability of Magnetic Structures on BD +26 730|Steven H.|Saar|CFA SAO|BD +26 730 is perhaps the most magnetically active K dwarf known, a rapidly rotating (P = 1.8 day) flare star with enormous chromospheric and transition-region line emission, highly variable X-ray flux, and large starspots with a known 60 year activity cycle period. Since the star is viewed nearly pole-on, almost all variability will be the result of the evolution of activity in time, rather than rotational modulation. Direct measurement of the magnetic field strength and fractional surface coverage of plages on the star is also possible through the careful analysis of magnetic line broadening. We propose to observe the star, now approaching starspot (and magnetic activity) maximum, with the IUE at multiple phases in order to study the time-variability of the chromospheric and transition-region activity. Simultaneous measurements of photometric colors, linear polarization, and magnetic line broadening will be combined with the IUE data to study the growth and decay of active regions, and explore the connections between photospheric magnetic fields, and the structure and energy balance of the hot, upper-atmospheric layers of the star. Comparison of the UV fluxes with earlier epoch IUE spectra taken near activity minimum will allow us to investigate differences in stellar activity at extremes in the magnetic cycle of the star. Our study will be the first investigation of strictly temporal evolution of magnetic fields and related activity on any star other than the Sun.|Y
FSLJL|A Coordinated Study of Flares and Active Regions on the by Draconis-Type Star CC Eridani|Jeffrey L.|Linsky|Colorado|We propose to observe the 1.56 day period spectroscopic binary CC Eri (K7Ve + dM?) continuously over its complete orbital period in order (1) to measure the ultraviolet emission from it's active regions and it's quiescent atmosphere separately and (2) to study flares that likely will occur during the observing run. CC Eri is the second brightest member of the BY Draconis class of spotted cool dwarfs, it has the shortest known orbital and rotational period, and it has the fastest rotational velocity of the BY Dra class. For these reasons it is likely a very active member and probably has one of the brightest ultraviolet emission line spectrum of its class. Since only one IUE spectrum has so far been obtained of this important object, we propose to begin a detailed study of its ultraviolet emission properties leading to a high-dispersion SWP observation next year.  We will obtain a continuous series of SWP-LO and LWP-LO spectra over the full orbital (= rotational period) in order to identify bright active regions (from the rotational modulation of emission line fluxes) and to correlate the location of these active regions with dark starspots, whose positions will be determined from contemporaneous optical photometry and spectroscopy. We also will study the time behavior of flares in different spectral lines and with coordinated optical photometry and VLA radio observations. Flares with U-magnitude enhancements greater than I magnitude are known to occur on average once every 12 hours. We plan to model the quiescent, active, and flaring atmospheres separately using emission measure diagnostics. CC Eri is an excellent candidate for this study, because it usually has a large amplitude photometric variation indicating an asymmetric distribution of spots (and thus active regions) across its surface, while it's flares are few but energetic. IUE is particularly well suited for such modulation studies.|Y
FSLKC|Simultaneous IUE/HST-GHRS Observations of AU MIC|Kenneth G.|Carpenter|NASA/GSFC|We propose to monitor the early dwarf-M flare star and BY Dra variable AU Mic over a two day period centered on the time of HST observations with the GHRS. The GHRS observations are part of the GHRS Investigation Definition Teams's Guaranteed Time Observing (GTO) program and are already approved. The GHRS observations cover a single, very narrow range of wavelengths (1342 - 1378 A) and their prime purpose is to detect and measure lines formed in the corona and in coronal flares, such as Fe XXI 1354 A and Fe XII 1349 A, that are too weak to be observed by IUE, along with a single transition region line (0 V) and lines from one chromospheric ion (C 1). We request simultaneous IUE observations to place the HST observations in a broader context, which will include a wider variety of chromospheric and transition region lines and their behavior over a 48 hour period approximately centered on the time of the GHRS observations. The GHRS observations are to be scheduled during HST Cycle 0, which (based on a December 1989 launch) covers the period February 15 - July 15, 1990 and could occur during either the 12th or 13th IUE observing episodes. This proposal is thus for two years, but all the NASA and ESA shifts are required to be contiguous and at a time which will overlap the HST observations.|Y

FSPEB|Transition Layers of Hyades F Stars|Erika H.|Bohm-Vitense|U Washington|We would like to observe most Hyades F main sequence stars in order to determine the dependence of transition layer emission on temperature, rotation, binarity and Li abundances. In order to study the dependence on any one parameter one has to keep all other parameters constant. For the Hyades cluster age and metal abundance are constant. The Hyades cluster is the nearest one for which the F stars are bright enough to be observed with IUE in the SWP wavelength region. At the same time there are enough F stars to study the dependence on one parameter with all other parameters being nearly the same.  In the F star region rotation decreases when going from early to late F stars. Simon and Drake suggest that the heating mechanism changes for B-V around 0.45. The chromospheric emission appears not to vary with time for stars earlier than F7 while it is variable for stars later than F8. Michaud suggests depletion of He for early F stars but not for late F stars. Boesgaard and Tripicco find a minimum in the Li abundances for stars with Teff around 6700 K. We want to study the changes (or not) in the transition layer emission related to all these events.  This is last year's proposal which was accepted for two years, but the committee failed to assign shifts for the second year.|Y

FUMRL|UV Observations of the "High" State of Z Canis Majoris|Russel M.|Levreault|Wesleyan University|We propose to obtain a Target of Opportunity observation of the FU Orionis variable Z Canis Majoris during its next identified "high" state. When combined with existing "low" state spectra, these observations will provide an unparalled opportunity to study a single accretion disk system at two different accretion rates. Our planned observations will enable us to accurately determine the temperature of the inner parts of the disk, and allow us to put strict limits on the presence of any boundary layer emission. The variation of both of these quantities with accretion rate should prove to be stern tests of accretion disk theory.|Y

FURGP|The Chemical Compositions of Three Fundamental Early B-Type Standards|Geraldine J.|Peters|USC|Using high resolution IUE spectra that have been co-added to reduce random and fixed pattern noise, we propose to determine abundances, especially of the iron group elements (e.g. Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Ni, and Fe), in three early B stars which have emerged as standards for this class. All of the program stars (epsilon CMa, B2 II; gamma Peg, B2 IV; and tau Her, B5 IV) display sharp lines that make them well suited for analysis by the technique of spectrum synthesis. epsilon CMa is especially important because not only has its angular diameter been measured, but it has also been strongly detected with EUVE in the region  400-730 A. Observation in the FUV is required for the determination of the abundances of the iron group elements because in early B stars there are no measurable lines from these elements in the optical region. A careful determination of the Fe group abundances will allow us to check theoretical calculations of the nucleosynthesis of light elements (especially those involving Si burning). Good Voyager UVS and ground-based optical spectra that already exist for the program stars will complement the IUE observations for this spectrum synthesis study. Effects of N-LTE will be investigated for selected lines. SWP-high dispersion images with exposures optimized for 1400, 1700, and 1900 A will be taken at four positions in the large aperture, while LWP-highs will be optimized at 2200, 2400, and 2740 A at three aperture locations.|Y

GANLD|IUE Observations of a Possible Galactic Chimney|Laura|Danly|STScI|We propose to obtain lUE spectra toward four stars that lie in the direction of a possible galactic chimney. Results from our previous work have shown that in the general direction of 1~330'and b ~60 them is a lack of neutral gas, a preponderance of highly ionized gas (as evidenced by Si IV, C IV, and especially N V), a lack of the infalling gas that is seen everywhere else in the north galactic sky, and an outwardly moving cloud. Taken together, these observation suggest that this might be the location of a galactic "chimney", where hot gas is escaping from the disk to the halo. Ile "chimney model" dominates current thinking about the source, support, and ionization of halo gas, yet no one has actually seen a chimney in our galaxy. The data we propose to obtain will enable us to evaluate the ionization, kinematics and distribution of gas in this direction, which, in turn, should help us determine if, indeed, a chimney exists in this region.|Y
GAPDT|Damped Lyman-alpha Absorption from Galaxies with Redshift < 1.6|David A.|Turnshek|U Pittsburgh|We have used IUE archival data, supplemented by new IUE observations in Years 14 and 15, to perform a systematic, unbiased survey for low to moderate redshift (0.05<z<1.6) galactic and proto-galactic H I disks. The survey was performed by searching for damped Ly-alpha absorption lines in the spectra of ~160 higher redshift background QSOs. Since the damped Ly-alpha absorption lines are thought to arise in intervening galactic or proto-galactic H I disks, the statistical results provide constraints on theories of galaxy formation. Individual identifications of damped Ly-alpha provide cases for follow-up study. In the context of a larger program to study damped Ly-alpha absorption, the objective of this IUE observing program is to obtain the IUE data needed to confirm or refute the candidate damped Ly-alpha absorption which we have identified. For 6 of the best candidates, the existing IUE data consist of one observation. By normal IUE standards, the existing spectra have low signal-to-noise ratio. Our experience at these signal-to-noise ratios suggest that an additional observation is needed to confirm or refute the candidate absorption. Therefore, we request 6 US1 shifts to reobserve the QSOs (2 SWP and 4 LWP).|Y
GARAL|Mid-UV Spectroscopy of the Galilean Satellites|A. Lonne|Lane|JPL|IUE obtained the first quantitative near-UV spectra of the Galilean satellites in 1978 and continued extensive observations through the mid-80s. Large longitudinal spectral variations with chemical and magnetospheric process implications were discovered. Few additional observations in this wavelength region have been done in the past 10 years. Ground-based IR studies show that Io has episodic volcanic eruptions that lead to spectral changes on its surface. This volcanic activity has implications for changes in the Jovian magnetosphere which in turn imply changes in magnetospheric modification processes on the surfaces of the other Galilean satellites. Recent evidence from HST and near-UV ground-based spectroscopy indicates that there appear to be changes on Europa and Callisto. New observations are required to examine the extent of these temporal changes. Next year the Galileo spacecraft will begin its intensive study of the Jovian system acquiring detailed satellite surface spectra at phase angles not achievable from Earth, but it will not have access to the Earth's phase angle region (0-12 deg) because of orbit orientation. The requested IUE data represent the completion of a >16 year period of calibrated self-consistent data, leading to a transfer of information to the HST/Galileo epoch about to begin.|Y
GARKS|Kinematics of Halo Gas: IUE Spectroscopy of Five Distant Stars|Kenneth R.|Sembach|MIT|We propose to obtain 11 well-exposed SWP spectra of five distant stars along low latitude sight lines to better understand the kinematics and density distribution of highly ionized gas in the Galactic halo. The spectra for each object will be combined with archival spectra when appropriate to produce composite spectra with S/N = 20 to 25. We will incorporate the C IV profiles into a global model of halo gas kinematics for which we have obtained high quality absorption profiles from our previous IUE programs and the IUE archives. The proposed data are needed to complete this data set and to provide measures of the highly ionized gas properties at large distances from the Galactic plane in the inner Galaxy.|Y
GARRH|Coordinated UV Observations of Gamma-Ray Selected Blazars|Robert C.|Hartman|NASA/GSFC|We propose to use the unique capabilities of the IUE satellite to make UV observations as part of a large international multiwavelength campaign to monitor gamma-ray selected blazars. This program is being coordinated by Hartman with the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO) phase 4 time line to obtain simultaneous observations of blazars over the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Multiwavelength observations are crucial for constraining models of these objects. The UV regime plays a particularly important role in most models because UV photons are thought to be likely seed photons for Compton production of the high-energy emission. However, to place meaningful constraints on models, the highly variable nature of blazar UV emission requires observations that are nearly simultaneous with those at high energies. Rather than relying on intensive monitoring of a single source, our goal is to study these objects as a class through regular IUE monitoring shifts and a ToO program. We identify targets which will be simultaneously monitored in wavelength regimes ranging from radio to high-energy gamma rays. Our proposed observations will provide the only simultaneous UV measurements of these objects and will be an important contribution to the multiwavelength data sets that are needed to test and constrain models of blazars.|Y

GCBAC|Ultraviolet Studies of Horizontal Branch Stars and of Globular Clusters in the Milky Way and The Magellanic Cloud|Authur D.|Code|Wisconsin|Ultraviolet data existing from two earlier orbiting instruments, the OAO-2 and the ANS, indicate the importance of carrying out spectroscopic investigations in the ultraviolet of globular clusters and horizontal branch stars. Because of the relative faintness of field horizortal branch stars, neither OAO-2 nor ANS observed a reasonable sample of these blue HB stars.  In particular no such stars inside globular clusters have been  measured individually.  In order to fully interpret existing globular cluster UV fluxes, knowledge of horizontal branch stars is essential. Most population synthesis has been carried out by the use of model atmospheres or empirical data on population I stars. Current knowledge of the spectra of HB stars and the effects of line blanketing are very sketchy. We propose to observe such stars in the long and short wavelength range.  OAO-2 and ANS observed only down to ~1400 A. Therefore several observations of globular clusters common to the OAO-2 and ANS data sets are of interest at wavelengths 1400 - 1100 A. This is the where the bluest stars dominate and as such is important for studies of stellar evolution. In addition we propose to observe some globular clusters in the magellanic clouds, where the difference in chemical composition may be important. All observations will be at low dispersion.|Y
GCBHG|Observation of Ultraviolet Cores in Globular Clusters with  IUE|Herbert|Gursky|Optical and Infrared Astronomy|We propose to continue and expand our previous IUE program of observations of globular clusters. We have found compact ultraviolet sources near the cluster centers that have no obvious optical counterparts (with the possible exception of M15). It is possible that the ultraviolet source in M 15 is a number of early-type stars; this may also be true of the other cluster sources. However, it also appears to be the case that the brightness distribution of these uv cores is more sharply peaked than the optical light. Thus it is likely that we are seeing a more sharply peaked matter distribution than the general stellar distribution. It may be that we are observing a stellar core related to the collapsed core predicted for compact globulars on the basis of dynamical calculations, and required by black hole models for cluster X-ray sources. Further observing time is necessary to explore this and other possibilities.  The nature of the observed phenomena is not clear. In particular, the relationship of X-ray sources to the ultraviolet sources is unknown. While all the X-ray clusters studied so far possess compact uv sources, two not identified with X-ray sources apparently have them as well. We request observing time to obtain accurate uv positions to be compared with upcoming accurate X-ray positions. We propose to map the centers of two clusters to examine the possibility that the uv sources are simply randomly distributed stars, and to examine the spatial extent of the broad (stellar) light distributions. |Y
GCCAC|UV Studies of Globular Clusters in the Magellanic Clouds|Authur D.|Code|Wisconsin|Observations of globular clusters in the  magellanic clouds during the 1979 IUE observing run demonstrated the feasability of such observations.  As these clusters are at large distances, the isolation of stars for visual photometry is virtually impossible. Therefore, the morphology of the blue and of the Horizontal Branch is undefined. With knowledge of the  UV-output of, such blue HB stars, the integrated UV light of such distant clusters will help understanding  the differences among the two groups of clusters in the LMC and theirrelation to galactic clusters.|Y
GCCJG|Globular Clusters and X-Ray Bursters|J.

Most of the bursters to be observed lie near the centers of globular clusters. We will also study the integrated UV flux from metal rich globular clusters.|Y

These data will be compared with similar data that have been collected for globular clusters in the Galaxy, which will indicate whether the ultraviolet characteristics of the M31 and Fornax clusters are similar to those of the galactic globulars of the same metal abundance. This will test whether these clusters have the same horizontal branch morphologies as the galactic clusters, which is an important diagnostic of the ages and chemical compositions of the clusters.|Y

GCGBA|UV Properties of Blue Horizontal Branch Globular Clusters|Bruce M.|Altner|A. R. CORP.|Recent theoretical attempts to understand the evolution of Population II stars have met with some success in accounting for certain features seen in globular cluster color magnitude diagrams. In particular, model evolutionary tracks have been published that connect the low luminosity subclass of UV-bright stars to direct evolution off the blue end of the horizontal branch and the high luminosity group to evolution, following the second ascent of the giant branch. However, relative to such well defined sequences, as the horizontal and first red giant branches there, is a great deal of scatter, among the UV-bright stars, when they are plotted on a composite CMD; these are rare stars and the sample is incomplete.  We propose to observe a sample of globular clusters for which no IUE spectra exist, and several others for which inadequate exposures were obtained. UV-bright stars are most frequently found in clusters with blue horizontal branches, and the clusters we have selected are all of this type. Archival SWP images of UV-bright stars in several such clusters suggest a bimodal luminosity distribution in accord with the division into low and high luminosity groupings predicted by theory. Further observations are necessary to confirm this result. Many UV-bright stars show a broad absorption feature suggestive of advanced evolution, i.e., Population I abundances.|Y
GCHAC|The Stellar Content of M31 Globular Clusters|Anne P.|Cowley|Arizona State University|Optical spectra show that the M31 globular cluster system contains many objects whose integrated stellar populations have substantially stronger hydrogen line strengths and/or very blue U-B colors compared to galactic globular clusters of otherwise comparable metallicity. We have recently obtained IUE observations of three M31 clusters to determine the nature of this hot/warm component. Preliminary inspection of the data shows these few clusters exhibit a variety of ultraviolet continuum strengths. However, too few objects have been observed to complete an analysis of the relationship of between metallicity, age, hot star contribution, and other parameters. In this proposal we ask to complete this initial survey of the ultraviolet luminosity of the brightest M31 clusters.|Y
GCHRB|IUE Observations of Globular Clusters|Roger A.|Bell|Maryland|Stellar evolution calculations and synthetic spectra calculations have recently been combined to give a large number of isochrones which are expressed in terms of observational quantities such as Mv and B-V. When compared with accurate cluster photometry of stars In the turn off region, globular cluster ages of about 18 billion years are obtained. Such ages may be checked by studying ultra-violet observations of the integrated light of the clusters. This ultra-violet light is contributed by horizontal branch stars and turn off region stars. When the effects of the former are subtracted from the data, the cluster ultra-violet light will depend upon the age and chemical composition of the turn off region stars. Since abundances are known for the clusters to be studied, their ages can be found.|Y
GCHRK|Integrated Spectra of Globular Clusters in M31|Richard G.|Kron|Chicago|UV observations of globular clusters, together with optical data, can provide important information on the early evolution of the parent galaxies, in particular: - on the phase of formation, from the distribution of ages both within a given galaxy, and from one galaxy to another - on the stellar population, from the analysis of the stars which are the dominant contributors to the UV light A recent investigation by Burstein et al. (1984) has revealed unexpected differences in the stellar populations of Galactic globular clusters as compared to the globulars in M31. The ultraviolet IUE data of the Cluster V64 in M31 taken by Cacciari et al. (1982) support their hypothesis that in this case these differences are due to the presence of a large number of very hot stars on the horizontal branch of the M31 clusters. In order to verify this hypothesis, we propose to observe three globular clusters in M31, and compare the results with similar observations available for the clusters in the galaxy and M31.|Y
GCIBA|Advanced Evolution in BHB Globular Clusters|Bruce M.|Altner|A. R. CORP.|We propose to observe the few remaining blue horizontal branch (BHB) globular cluster cores that have never been observed with IUE and yet are obtainable within reasonable exposure times. Within such clusters are sometimes found hot, low mass stars in advanced stages of evolution (i.e. post-He flash states), and these are often unobservable using optical detectors because of overcrowding in the condensed cores. Our interest is in determining the temperatures, luminosities and gravities of such stars in the cores of this remaining set of clusters, as these stars are still sufficiently rare that the discovery of a few more increases the sample size by a significant fraction. We have detected one BHB star in NGC 6541, and one also in NGC 1904, the two clusters that we were able to investigate in a previous IUE program. We are also expecting to find more examples of SWP spectra that show broad, anomalous absorption features centered at 1400 A and 1600 A, which may be related to a population of cool white dwarfs or rotating horizontal branch stars. The one SWP spectrum obtained of NGC 1904 shows this feature more strongly than any cluster observed to date.|Y

GCJAD|Giants in Globular Clusters|Andrea K.|Dupree|CFA SAO|We propose to measure the chromospheric transition Mg II in four red giant stars in globular clusters to define the radiative energy loss and structure of the chromosphere in a population of known ages and specific metallicities. Simultaneous or contemporaneous high resolution spectroscopy at H-alpha and Ca II (K) can reveal signatures of mass flow for correlation with chromospheric emission levels.|Y
GCJBA|Further IUE Investigations at the Core of M 79|Bruce M.|Altner|Applied Research Corp.|We propose to obtain additional spectra of the extremely blue, centrally condensed globular cluster M 79 (NGC 1904). The only existing IUE images of this cluster are two SWP spectra acquired at the center of light. Although the target coordinates and orientation of the large aperture on the plane of the sky are similar in both images, and the individual, spatially resolved IUE spectra of the components indicate that the same stars were observed in each image, an unexplained displacement of one star with respect to another is suggested by the data. We believe that an additional SWP spectrum may help us to understand this curious phenomenon. We also propose to obtain the spectrum of the hottest star in the cluster core (B-V = -0.4) in order to evaluate its evolutionary status and its contribution to the integrated light. Such stars are quite rare in old stellar populations.|Y
GCJJS|IUE Observations of Collapsed-Core Globular Clusters|J. Micheal|Shull|Colorado - CASA|We propose low-resolution SWP observations in search of C IV, Si IV, and He II emission lines from active binary stars and cataclysmic variables in the cares of "postcore-collapse" globular clusters (Djorgovski and King 1986). These emission lines are unmistakable signatures of stellar activity. Theoretical models of globular cluster evolution show that core collapse will develop after ~ 100 times the current central relaxation time, or 10^9 years for many current clusters. It is therefore reasonable to believe that many clusters have already collapsed. Observations of central surface brightness cusps in 28 clusters suggest that as many as 25% of Galactic globulars are currently experiencing "life after core collapse", with core structure modified by the formation of "hard" binaries via three-body encounters or two-body tidal capture. These tightly bound systems may merge or stimulate stellar activity. Given the enhanced core population of white dwarfs from mass segregation, a significant fraction of these binaries are expected to be cataclysmic variables originating from encounters of white dwarfs and main sequence stars.  At low resolution, IUE is is able to detect emission lines from 50-100 cataclysmic variables in globulars at 6-10 kpc, whereas recent numerical simulations (Statler, Ostriker, and Cohn 1986) predict that ~ 10^3 hard binaries should form during core collapse. These binaries should be roughly equally divided between "normal-normal" binaries (W Ursa Majoris stars) and "normaldegenerate" binaries (Cataclysmic Variables). Therefore, SWP observations of globulars with central cusps and low reddening will identify the presence of core CV's or set a limit 10% below theoretical predictions.|Y
GCKAC|Intermediate-Age Clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud|Anne P.|Cowley|Arizona State University|The LMC is rich with globular and populous-blue clusters (young, globular-like clusters). Unlike the globular clusters in the Milky Way which are uniformly old (~14 x 10^9 years), the clusters in the LMC to span a wide range of ages from less than 10^7 years to more than 10^10 years. Since the frequency of hot stars within a cluster is extremely age dependent, the ultraviolet colors of the cluster change markedly with time. Thus, the UV region of the spectrum is ideal for inferring the age of a cluster from its integrated light. Furthermore, it appears that the ultraviolet spectrum depends only slightly on the metal abundance. Thus one could use the ultraviolet properties of LMC clusters, whose ages are known from color-magnitude diagrams, to derive age/UVcolor calibrations to compare with more distant, unresolved clusters in 1431 and eventually with globular clusters in other galaxies. Recent IUE observations of some M31 globular clusters show that they are brighter in the ultraviolet than their counterparts in the Milky Way. One interpretation is that the M31 globular clusters may be younger. Although ~30 LMC clusters have been observed with IUE, the existing data include only the youngest (1O^9 yrs) and the oldest (>10^10 yrs) clusters without sampling the important intermediate-age clusters. We propose to obtain ultraviolet spectra of six intermediate-age LMC clusters to establish how the ultraviolet (hot-star) component changes through this critical period.|Y
GCKBA|Two Dimensional Spatial Analysis of Globular Cluster Cores|Bruce M.|Altner|ARC|We have developed a technique whereby spatial information along both the dispersion and the cross-dispersion axes of the IUE large aperture can be extracted from two or more spatially resolved spectra of a given extended source. In this proposal we demonstrate both the validity of the technique and the value of the full two dimensional spatial solution in such crowded regions as the central cores of globular dusters. Since the analysis procedure requires a minimum of two images of each target, slightly offset from one another in aperture position angle, we request observing time to obtain additional SWP spectra of a number of clusters which have been observed only once before.|Y
GCLAC|Evolved Clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud|Anne P.|Cowley|Arizona State University|The LMC is rich with globular and populous-blue clusters (young, globular-like clusters). Unlike the globular clusters in the Milky Way which are uniformly old (~14 x 10^9 years), the LMC clusters span a wide range of ages from < 10^7 to > 10^10 years. Since the frequency of hot stars within a cluster is extremely age dependent, the ultraviolet colors of a cluster change markedly with time. Thus, the UV region of the spectrum is ideal for inferring the age of a cluster from its integrated light. Furthermore, UV colors have been shown to depend only slightly on metal abundance. Using the ultraviolet properties of LMC clusters, whose ages are known from color-magnitude diagrams, one can derive an age/UV-color calibration to compare with more distant, unresolved clusters in M31 and, eventually, other galaxies. IUE observations of some M31 globular clusters show that they are brighter in the UV than their Milky Way counterparts. One interpretation is that the M31 globular clusters may be younger. Although -30 LMC clusters have been observed with IUE, the existing data include primarily the young (<10^9 yrs) clusters, plus a small number of the very oldest (>10^10 yrs) ones. It is necessary to obtain ultraviolet observations for some intermediate age clusters which may be closely related to the M31 globular clusters. Such an IUE project was started in 1988. We propose to complete this work by observing four more of these evolved LMC clusters. The goal is to determine how the UV colors (from hot stars) change through this critical but unsampled age range.|Y
GCLRR|Ultraviolet Spectroscopy of Galactic Globular Clusters|R. Michael|Rich|Columbia University|We propose to obtain UV spectra for a sample of 10 metal rich globular clusters which are members of the "disk system" of clusters. This research fills a crucial gap in our library of globular cluster UV spectra, as IUE has observed only two galactic globular clusters with abundances in excess of 1/10 solar. We will search for evidence of the hot-UV stars which dominate the energy distribution shortward of 2000A in metal rich galaxy populations. Because the 2000-3300A region is so sensitive to extra turnoff light, the LWP spectra of old, metal rich globular clusters can be compared with metal rich galaxy populations to detect trace contributions from young stars. We also propose to obtain spectra for crucial outer halo globular clusters which have not been observed by IUE. Included are NGC 7006, the classic second parameter cluster, and NGC 2419, one of the most distant galactic globular clusters. We will search for a radial gradient in the UV spectrum of the outer halo cluster NGC 7099, in which there is evidence for a bluer central population.|Y

GCPKC|The Brightest Star in M79 at 1500 Angstroms: A future White Dwarf?|Kwang-Ping|Cheng|NASA/GSFC|We request IUE time to obtain low dispersion SWP spectra of the most UV luminous star we identified in the globular cluster M79 using the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UIT) during the Astro-1 Space Shuttle flight (Hill et al. 1992). Based on the UIT UV color-magnitude diagram, the hottest and most UV bright star in M79 appears to be descending in the HR diagram along a "pre-white dwarf'" track. The fact that all stars in a globular cluster are at the same (independently determined) distance offers a unique opportunity to compare this extremely hot star (> 30, 000 K) with other types of hot stars both in clusters and in the field. We will fit the IUE spectrum of this UV-bright star to flux distributions computed from the low-metallicity LTE model atmospheres of Kurucz (1992). The best fit model will provide useful constraints on poorly known theoretical parameters that govern post-HB evolution. Also, the surface gravity, log g, derived from the Kurucz model fit will offer an important physical comparison with white dwarfs. Inspection of spectral features will help us to assess the relative abundance of helium in the stellar atmosphere and confirm the expected high temperature.|Y

GDHBS|Studies of Interstellar Gas in the Galactic Disk and Halo|U.|Wisconsin|Wisconsin|We propose to analyze the UV interstellar absorption lines of highly ionized species toward a group of 44 early B type stars. Most of the data were obtained by us over the past two years and the remainder are from the IUE archives. The stars lie in the galactic plane and halo with Z distances away from the plane extending to 3.0 kpc. The line of sight distances range upward to 13 kpc with a large number of stars toward the galactic center at line of sight distances exceeding 4 kpc. A preliminary inspection of the data reveals the wide spread existence of NV in galactic disk and halo gas. An analysis of the data should provide important new insight about the distribution and origin of highly ionized gas in the galactic disk and halo.|Y

The primary target is the active cool star Capella; the secondary target is the hot white dwarf G191B2B. We request observing time on the IUE to obtain simultaneous UV and EUV spectrophotometry of these two bright UV sources. In the case of Capella this is a unique opportunity to obtain simultaneous coronal and transition region diagnostics from one of the archetypes of stellar activity.|Y
GDKEG|HD 129333|Edward F.|Guinan|Villanova|HD 129333 is a remarkable single. young dwarf G-star with a spectral type (dGO) very close to that of the Sun. It has the highest level of Call HK emission of a single star of its spectral type. We discovered it to have low-amplitude (~5%) light variations which indicate it to be a rapid rotator with a rotation period of 2.7d. The light variations have been modeled as rotational modulation due to starspots. Its space motions and its Li abundance are consistent with its being a member of the Pleiades moving group, with an approximate age of 70 Myr. The high level of activity and its rapid rotation are consequences of its youth. It has apparently only recently arrived on the main-sequence, and has not yet spun down significantly through magnetic braking. Its Proximity (d =~30 pc) and its consequent brightness (+7.5 mag) make HD 129333 accessible to investigation with the IUE. We plan to use IUE observations in conjunction with ground-based photometry and high-resolution spectroscopy to map out the properties of the active regions on the star at different levels in the stellar atmosphere as they rotate in and out of view. This 3-dimensional approach will be used to analyze the possible relationship between the location and distribution of the photospheric spots, the chromospheric plages, and the activity sites in the transition-region, their spatial distribution across the star, and to estimate magnetic field strengths and filling factors directly from the optical spectroscopy using a Zeeman technique. HD 129333, therefore, can provide us with a wealth of information about the early Sun and its magnetic dynamo.|Y
GDKJC|MGI I Observations of Solar-Type Stars in the Hyades and Pleiades|Jean-Pierre|Caillault|Georgia|The known ages of galactic clusters provide a means to calibrate the evolution of chromospheric activity in solar-type stars. Two of the most important of these clusters, the Hyades and the Pleiades, have never been thoroughly studied with the long wavelength cameras of the IUE.  Despite this absence, recent studies (based on older stars) have claimed an exponential decay of chromospheric (and transition region) emission with time which would likely reach a plateau at the youthful ages of the Hyades and Pleiades.  It is our intention to make high-resolution MgII observations of 16 solar-type stars (S from each cluster) in order to provide 2 new statistically significant age "data points" on the chromospheric activity versus age plots. These long wavelength observations will also serve as excellent complements to our upcoming short wavelength (SW) observations of the Pleiades and to existing SW observations of the Hyades.|Y
GDKTS|Chromospheric Activity of Hyades Dwarfs|Theodore|Simon|Hawaii|Measurements of rotational velocities in the Hyades cluster have led to the discovery of a number of rapidly rotating dM stars with v sin i > 10-15 km/s. These stars rotate at least 2-3 times faster than M dwarfs in the field, including even the youngest field stars that display energetic flares or very large starspots. It is thought that the rapid rotators in the Hyades, like a number of rapidly rotating G-K dwarfs in younger clusters, may be relatively recent arrivals on the main sequence and may have been spun up by contraction along their pre-main sequence evolutionary tracks. For the G-K stars this rapid rotation decays to much slower rates on time scales very much shorter than those implied by simple braking laws such as Skumanich's squareroot law. The time scale required for this loss of angular momentum apparently depends on the mass of the star, being an order of magnitude longer for the low mass M stars than the high mass G-K stars. If this spindown is caused by magnetic braking from coronal winds, then there may be a feedback mechanism that governs stellar dynamos, which serves to control both coronal/chromospheric heating and the rate at which angular momentum is lost. The purpose of this proposal is to try to understand this mechanism by exploring the connection between the time decay of rotation and the time decay of chromospheric activity. I am proposing here to measure the chromospheric Mg II emission of a sample of the rapidly rotating M dwarfs in the Hyades. These fluxes will be compared with data for pre-main sequence and field dM stars to determine the evolution of chromospheric activity with age and the dependence of activity on rotation rate for stars of very low mass.|Y

GHEBS|Continued Studies of Milky Way Halo Gas|Blair D.|Savage|Wisconsin|Six IUE shifts are requested to obtain multiple high dispersion spectra of two LMC stars. The spectra for each star will be coadded to produce high signal-to-noise interstellar line spectra for two more lines of sight through the Milky Way halo. The absorption along these new lines of sight will be compared to that already found toward HD 5980 in the SMC and HD 36402 in the LMC in order to obtain new information about the spatial distribution and composition of Milky Way halo gas. The stars to be observed at high dispersion include HD 269676 and the brightest UV source among the following: HD 269743, HD 269219, Sk-69 106, HD 35517, and HD 38029. The second high dispersion target will be selected by first obtaining low dispersion SWP spectra.|Y
GHEDY|Absorption Measures of Gas in Galactic Halos|Donald G.|York|Princeton|Evidence for hot 8OOOO K halo gas has recently been presented based on IUE spectra of high latitude extragalactic sources: stars in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, Seyfert Galaxies, and Supernovae in other galaxies. Several interesting problems have arisen from the halo interpretation placed on these data. Using a model of galactic rotation to account for velocities observed, the C IV and Si IV appear to arise mainly within 10 kpc, yet C IV-containing gas halos inferred to exist from QSO absorption measures must be 50-100 kpc in size. Furthermore, simple halo models do not predict the existence of cold and hot gas at the same velocities and distances, as inferred from current data.  We propose to observe a number of extragalactic sources in which we expect to see absorption lines from a galactic halo. Using the IUE high dispersion mode, we will be able to discern whether a model of a rotating halo is consistent with the observations, or whether other processes are important for understanding velocities. in the halo gas. We will also be able to generalize the more unexpected parts of the current interpretations by observing several species sampling different temperatures in at least five directions in our own galaxy, as well as in halos of the chosen background sources. Background sources are selected from a) Seyfert galaxies and QSO's whose emission lines are red shifted by appropriate amounts to coincide with galactic absorption lines, b) cores of elliptical galaxies, bright enough to provide a strong continuum at Mg II 2800 A and c) BL Lac objects.|Y
GHEST|The Extent of a Hot Gaseous Galactic Halo|Scott D.|Tremaine|MIT|IUE observations of high latitude, low velocity absorption lines in Magellanic cloud stars have been interpreted as indicating that a hot halo exists out to about 10 kpc above the plane of the Galaxy. Observationally, this "hot" gas contains C IV and C II, Si II, and O I at the same velocities. Whatever the cause of the coexistence of these quite different ionization stages, we can predict that absorption lines of Mg II (2800 A observed in spectra of the cores of some globular clusters (d~10 kpc) will show almost the same velocity spread and equivalent widths as those seen in the Magellanic Cloud stars (d~70 kpc). In the previous two years of this program, we have made observations of the cores of NGC 1851, NGC 362, 47 Tuc and M 15, and have demonstrated that the technique is successful. We propose to continue with observations of 2-4 further globular cores to increase longitude coverage. In particular, we wish to determine the cnmposition of a component at -110 km s^-1 seen optically in the line of sight to NGC 5824.|Y
GHFBS|Investigation of Motions in the Gaseous Galactic Halo|Blair D.|Savage|Wisconsin|Velocities and ionization structure of gas in the distant halo of the Milky Way will be investigated. Only very few stars at large z distance, blue enough and bright enough for IUE, exist. Here we propose to extend existing scarce data and observe the overly luminous blue horizontal branch star VZ 1128 in the globular cluster M 3 (NGC 5272). V Z 1128 has the properties: Sp = 0, V = 14.93, B-V = -.27, l = 42, b = +79, r = 13 kpc, z = 8.9 kpc, Vr = -150 km s-^1. This star is of unique interest for halo gas studies since it lies close to the galactic pole. Based on our experience with observations of similar but closer objects, we expect 100 and 75 DN net at 1300 and 1800A respectively in 15 hours exposure at high dispersion. This will allow us to investigate the strength and velocity of in particular interstellar C II and C IV in the halo perpendicular to the Milky Way plane. The emphasis will be on the kinematics of the halo gas in a direction for which galactic rotation effects should be negligible.|Y
GHFFB|An Ultraviolet Search for High Velocity Gas at High-Galactic Latitudes|Frederick C.|Bruhweiler|Catholic University|The feasibility of extragalactic EUV astronomy hinges upon the lack of absorbing H I at high galactic latitudes. Current UV and EUV data for distances up to 60pc reveal little absorption toward the north galactic pole, while at larger distances, 21cm data indicate substantial, but patchy low velocity H I. Even when no significant 21cm is detected, absorption from diffuse low H I column density clouds both in the disk and in the halo may still give large optical depths in the EUV. High velocity (HV) clouds, possibly arising in the halo, are detected at 21cm covering 10 percent of the sky outside the plane. Although current IUE results for long pathlengths are interpreted !is evidence for cool gas up to 10 kpc above the plane and corotating with the disk gas, no actual HV gas, (V(LSR) >50km s^-1') is seen. These results may be ambiguous and other interpretations can be made. Only one object has been studied in the UV at high galactic latitudes by Copernicus (HD93521; d=750pc, b^pi=62degrees), which shows high velocity gas (V(LSR) ~ -100km s^-1).  It is also the only object so far studied, excluding those toward the Magellanic Stream, that is toward a 21cm HV cloud. observations toward the galactic poles offer the best means of detecting HV gas (i.e. v^z =V -Sin(b) ). Also, clouds accelerated by gravity have the largest velocities near the plane. We propose to use the IUE to search for HV clouds toward 0 subdwarfs and Feige B stars (d<1000pc) near the plane at high galactic latitudes (b>45degrees) utilizing the sensitive UV interstellar lines. We also, have a few targets toward the 21cm northern HV (-200< LSR <-100km s^-1) cloud complex near l^pi =1800. This study would be, unlike previous investigations, independent of assumptions about corotation. For a statistically significant sample, the number of HV cloud detections, velocities, and limits on column density would yield information about the number and scale height of clouds in the halo, and about the future of EUV astronomy.|Y
GHFLH|The Distrubution of Interstellar Gas in the Galactic Halo|Lewis M.|Hobbs|Chicago|We propose high-dispersion IUE observations of interstellar absorption lines in the spectra of 15 early-B stars at high galactic latitude. Our primary goal is to determine the column density N-alpha (H I) of neutral gas toward each of the stars, from the Ly-alpha line. The measurements will be used to supplement similar Ly-alpha data already obtained from both Copernicus and IUE toward 30 other highlatitude OB stars, as well as new 21-cm emission-line profiles which we have observed toward the entire set of 45 stars. The proposed measurements then will allow the first direct, accurate, comprehensive study of the density distribution of the cold, neutral interstellar gas with distance from the galactic plane, near the solar circle. Either the ratios [N21(H I)/N-alpha(H I)] or the differences [N21(H I)-N-alpha (H I)] give the amounts of neutral gas both in front of and beyond the accurately known position of each suitable star in the halo. This neutral gas is believed to constitute about 90% of the total mass of the gaseous halo.|Y

In the previous years of this program, we have made observations of the cores of NGC 1851, NGC 362, 47 Tuc and M 15, and have demonstrated that the technique is successful. We wish to continue with the program to obtain a total of four long high-resolution exposures of these brightest globulars. These spectra will help to place limits at known distances on the number of high velocity interstellar components to be expected, and thus may help explain the complexity of QSO absorption spectra.|Y
GHGBS|The Galactic Distribution of Halo Gas|Blair D.|Savage|Wisconsin|Four IUE shifts are requested to obtain high dispersion SWP spectra of galactic O and B stars at galactocenter distances R of less than 7 kpc. The data will be used to study changes in the properties of galactic halo gas from the central region to the local region of the Milky Way. From theoretical considerations we expect the central regions of the Milky Way to support a denser halo than that observed locally.|Y
GHGDY|Very Low H I Column Densities in the Halo|Donald G.|York|Chicago|We propose to determine upper limits to H I column densities toward four halo dwarf stars that are more than 1 kpc away. Our objective is to find the frequency of pathlengths through the halo with N(HI) < 10^18cm^-2. If such low column densities can be found, it will have important implications for design of future Far UV instruments (FUSE), since it means such an instrument should be designed with significant spectroscopic ability at lambda < 912A. Such low H I column densities would also imply the existence of tunnels through which UV radiation from the disk could escape into the halo. Such leaking radiation could easily dominate the halo radiation field: the leaking radiation sets the upper limits to the unknown photoionization rate at lambda < 912A in the galactic halo. Finally, the path lengths with minimum H I are the directions along which direct measurements of the UV background radiation from QSO's, galaxies, or decaying neutrinos should be searched for.|Y
GHGFB|An Ultraviolet Search for High Velocity Gas Toward the South Galactic Pole|Frederick C.|Bruhweiler|Catholic University|The feasibility of extragalactic EUV astronomy hinges upon the lack of absorbing H   at high galactic latitudes. Current UV and EUV data for distances up to 150pc reveal little absorption toward the north galactic pole, and up to 90pc toward the south galactic pole. At larger distances, 21cm data indicate substantial, but patchy low velocity H I. High velocity (HV) clouds, possibly arising in the halo, are detected at 21cm covering 10 percent of the sky outside the plane. Although current IUE results for long pathlengths are interpreted as evidence for cool gas up to lOkpc above the plane and corotating with the disk gas, no actual HV gas, (VLSR > 50km s^-1) is seen. These results may be ambiguous and other interpretations can be made. Observations toward the galactic poles offer the best means of detecting HV gas (i.e. Vz^obs = Vz.Sin(b). Also, clouds accelerated by gravity have the largest velocities near the plane. We propose to use IUE archival data for hot stars with d~<10OOpc to search for HV clouds near the plane at high galactic latitudes (b<-45) utilizing the sensitive UV interstellar lines. This study, unlike previous  investigations, is independent of assumptions about corotation. For a statistically significant sample, the number of HV clouds detections, velocities, and limits on column density would yield information about the number and scale height of clouds in the halo, and about the future of EUV astronomy.|Y
GHGLH|The Distrubution of Interrstelar Gas in the Galactic Halo|Lewis M.|Hobbs|Chicago|We propose continued high-dispersion IUE observations of interstellar absorption lines in the spectra of early-B stars at high galactic latitude.  Our primary goal in to determine the column density Nalpha (H I) of neutral gas toward each of 8 faint, probably distant stars, from the Ly-alpha line. The measurements will be used to critically supplement similar Ly-alpha, data already obtained from both Copernicus and IUE toward about 45 other high-latitude OB stars, as well as new 21-cm emission-line profiles which we have observed toward the entire set of stars. These measurements will allow the first direct, accurate, comprehensive study of the density distribution of the cold, neutral interstellar gas with distance from the galactic plane, near the solar circle.  Either the ratios [N 21 (H 1)/N-alpha(H I)) or the differences [N (H I)-N-alpha (H I)] give the amounts of neutral gas both in front of and beyond the accurately known position of each suitable star in the halo. This neutral gas is believed to constitute about go% of the total mass of the gaseous halo.|Y
GHHBS|Investigations of Motions in the Gaseous Galactic Halo|Blair D.|Savage|Wisconsin|Gas in the halo has been probed by observing VZ1128 (V=14.93) in M3 near the galactic North Pole in a ESA-NAM 2-shift in December 1983. In spite of the faintness of such a UV-bright star in a globular cluster, the absorption lines of CII, SiII and likely CIV were present. The data reveal the inflow of "neutral" gas at velocities of up to 80 km/s.  Having demonstrated the feasability of such observations, we propose to observe in SEW 2 more stars in other directions in the Milky Way halo. These are UHB in M5 (I = 4, b = 47, r = 8 kpc and z = 6 kpc) and 133 in M10 (1 = 15, b = +23, r = 6 kpc and z = 3 kpc). The data will be used to gain additional insights about the notion of halo gas.|Y
GHHDY|IUE Proposal for 1985-1986 Observing Year CIV in Galactic Halos|Donald G.|York|Chicago|Evidence for Galactic halo gas (T - 80000  K) has accumulated over the past few years. Work by several researchers has led to surprising conclusions. The gas is not as extended to high z as expected (d < 10 kpc). By contrast, similar lines occur so frequently in spectra of distant QSO's that the postulated intervening galaxy halos must be 50-100 kpc in size. The Galactic lines are found mainly near zero velocity +- 50 km s^-1 , whereas QSO lines are often much broader and consist of many components.  We propose to continue studies of lines of sight through the Galactic halo to learn its typical properties. Our specific goals are 1) to determine the uniformity of CIV absorption in our own Galaxy halo 2) to compare line profiles of C IV with those observed by us in high z QSO absorption line systems. 3) to try to determine the density of the halo gas; we call also place limits on the density of intergalactic clouds at the present epoch by looking for slightly redshifted Ly-alpha lines.  Previous observations by us have demonstrated the feasibility of doing this program with IUE, but only a few sources were available so we obtained poor sampling of independent halo lines of right. New sources have been found recently that allow our global questions to be answered.|Y
GHIBS|Motions of High Latitude Halo Gas|Blair D.|Savage|Wisconsin|We propose to observe 8 additional high latitude, distant halo stars to examine the kinematic behavior of gas at large distances from the galactic plane. All the archive data appropriate to this project have been retrieved and evaluated. These data suggest that material with very large peculiar velocities is commonly found beyond z=3 Kpc and always found beyond z=4 Kpc. Furthermore, the absorption is always found to be strongly skewed to negative velocities, suggesting infall to the galactic disk. Finally, there is an obvious asymmetry in the velocity structure of the halo gas between the northern and southern galactic hemispheres. However, these ideas are not conclusive, because of a lack of completeness in the sample. In the description of the proposed research program below, the archive data is presented, these specific points are discussed, and an observing program is outlined which will support or disprove the claims made on the basis of the archive results.|Y

GHJAS|Observations of Resonance Scattering in Galactic Coronae|Andrew|Smith|NASA/GSFC|Previous IUE absorption line measurements indicate that the Galactic corona contains significant column densities of doubly and triply ionized species.  However, it is very difficult to determine the spatial distribution and unambiguously establish the ionization mechanism for the observed ions from these absorption line measurements. Although collisionally excited coronal lines are exceedingly faint it should be possible to observe with the IUE emission produced by starlight resonantly scattered by the coronal ions in the lines of Si III 1206, Si IV 1400, C IV 1550 and possibly N V 1240 and C II 1335. We estimate surface brightness and exposure times yielding a signal at the 25 DN level. We propose to observe two edge-on galaxies, UGC 6697 and UCC 8967, in clusters with radial velocities of -6000 km s^-1 such that coronal Si III 1206.5 and L-alpha lines are redshifted free from contamination by geocoronal L-alpha. The long axis of the large aperture is oriented to obtain line intensity data as a function of altitude (2 Kpc to 11 Kpc) above the galactic planes. Using morphological information gathered from the observations of UGC 6697 and UGC 8967 we will observe a nearby edge-on galaxy, NGC 253, which exhibits an X-ray corona with the specific purpose of looking for evidence supporting the Galactic Fountain model.|Y
GHKBS|Halo Gas Toward Three Very Distant Stars|Blair D.|Savage|Wisconsin|We propose to obtain high signal-to-noise high-resolution SWP and LWR spectra of dime distant halo stars in order to study the properties of galactic halo gas. The stars have been carefully selected by examining the spectra of 70 objects included in the recent halo gas survey of Savage and Massa(1987). The stars lie at very large distances (5 to 9 kpc) toward the inner region of the galaxy and have z distances of 0.8, 1.1 and 2.2 kpc. The objects are bright enough to permit the acquisition of multiple high dispersion spectra of each star in slightly more than one low radiation shift. The requested data will complement similar halo gas measurements already obtained and published for the LMC and SMC sight lines. Some of the scientific goals of the program include: LA study aimed at determining the origin of the moderate and highly ionized gas in the galactic halo by carefully intercomparing absorption line profiles for those species expected to be created by photoionization (e.g. Al III and Si IV ) with those more likely created by collisional ionization in galactic fountain gas ( e.g. C IV and N V). 2. The assembly of a data base which will significantly enhance the value of Space Telescope Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph observations of selected interstellar lines to be obtained with guaranteed observing time two of the stars. 3. A study (if possible) of the elemental depletion of high z gas in the inner galaxy.|Y
GHKLD|Outflowing Gas Toward SGP|Laura|Danly|STScI|Recent results on Milky Way halo gas have shown that the interstellar absorption characteristics are vastly different toward the North Galactic Pole (NGP) compared to the South Galactic Pole (SGP). In the north, large amounts of cool, low ionization gas are seen to be failing toward the disk. This behavior is also seen in the high ionization states. Toward the south, however, ionized gas appears to have a preferentially positive velocity, suggestive of outflow. However, an observational bias in the sample precludes any firm conclusions from being drawn. We propose to observe four new halo sources to investigate this potential outflow. In addition, the new data would greatly improve the spatial coverage of the sample of background sources toward the SGP.|Y
GHLLD|IUE Observations of Clouds in the Milky Way Halo|Laura|Danly|STScI|Over the last few years we have been studying the nature of interstellar clouds in the halo of our galaxy, using optical, ultraviolet, and 21-cm radio observations. Recent results from our studies of data in the IUE archive have shown significant differences in the ionization structure and depletion patterns between high-velocity absorption from halo clouds and zero-velocity disk absorption components. Our work has included a detailed study of the low-ionization species, which we find to be a major component of halo gas, as well as high-ionization species. Our method of study has demonstrated that substantial improvement can be made in deriving column densities of ultraviolet interstellar species by comparing high spectral resolution optical absorption data to high signal-to-noise IUE absorption data. Our previous work has identified several promising lines of sight for detailed study of halo gas using this method. The IUE archive is extensive and very valuable lo our program. However, a small number of halo directions critical for the completion of our program either are not adequately represented in the archive or have not yet been observed. This proposal seeks IUE time to acquire the missing spectra.|Y
GHNBS|Galactic Radial Inflow/Outflow of Highly Ionized Gas|Blair D.|Savage|U Wisconsin - Madison|We propose to obtain high signal-to-noise high resolution SWP spectra of six distant halo stars in order to study the properties of Galactic halo gas. Two of the six stars have been carefully selected by examining the spectra of about 40 objects included in the recent halo gas surveys of Savage and Massa (1987). These two stars lie at very large distances (-7 kpc) toward the Galactic center. The objects are bright enough to permit the acquisition of multiple high dispersion spectra of each star in a few low radiation shifts. Four additional targets will be observed with single SWP exposures to complement the higher quality multiple exposure acquisitions. Some of the scientific goals of the program include: 1. A study aimed at determining if a Galactic radial inflow or outflow of highly ionized material exists as predicted by Galactic fountain models. 2. A study aimed at determining the origin of the moderate and highly ionized gas in the galactic halo by carefully intercomparing absorption line profiles for those species expected to be created by photoionization (e.g., Al III and Si IV ) with those more likely created by collisional ionization in galactic fountain gas (e.g., C IV and N V).|Y
GHNJC|Characteristics of Extinction in the Disk and Halo Gas|Jason A.|Cardelli|U Wisconsin - Madison|The recent results of Cardelli, Clayton, and Mathis (1988, 1989) have shown that the general variability of extinction arising in diverse range of environments from diffuse to the outer portions of dense clouds is both systematic and predictable and can be reasonably understood through a regular and systematic application of relative growth and destruction processes.  Are these results also applicable to environments where a single 'process', such as destruction, dominates? To address this question, we are requesting 5 US2 shifts for the purpose of studying the nature of UV extinction and its range of variability toward a number of sight lines that sample extremely low density gas in the galactic disk and halo where destruction processes like shocks and radiation are expected to be dominant. The program sight lines, which are only moderately reddened, sample a range of galactic distances, 3 kpc 5R <=9 kpc, and altitudes, 20 pc <= | z |<= 2000 pc. These sight lines have very low reddening per unit distance and have been carefully selected it, the hope of avoiding extinction arising from clouds.  This proposal will allow us to answer several basic questions, For example, what is the nature of '2175 A' bump and far-UV extinction in extremely low density gas? Do the characteristics of extinction in low density gas depend upon the height above the plane? Does long-term exposure of dust to harsh, low density environments result in a well defined, uniform extinction curve? The answers to these questions, when combined with our emerging understanding of the nature of dust in diffuse and dark cloud environments, will set practical limits on the possible physical nature of the dust. In addition, these results may lead to a quantifiable average extinction law in low density environments as has been found for diffuse and dark cloud environments (Cardelli, Clayton, and Mathis 1989). Understanding the nature of UV extinction variability in the low density disk and halo has applications to the dereddening of extragalactic sources which is extremely useful in the era of UV observations with the Hubble Space Telescope.|Y

The observations will be used to place the stars in the HR diagram, and to determine the relative birthrates of pre- white dwarfs. They will also be used to obtain information about the metallic-line spectra of these stars and to look for evidence of mass loss.|Y

GHPKS|Searching for the Base of the Galactic Halo|Kenneth R.|Sembach|MIT|We propose to obtain high signal-to-noise SWP spectra of five distant stars in Milky Way interarm directions to determine if these regions represent the base of the Galactic halo. The five low latitude stars lie at distances of 3 to 5 kpc along low density (n < 0.2 cm^-3) sight lines. We will obtain multiple spectra for five stars, three of which already have single IUE spectra and show interesting UV absorption profiles. The objects are bright enough to be observed in several low radiation shifts. We will use the observations to do detailed studies of the Si IV, C IV, and N V line profiles toward these objects. We will study both the kinematics and physical properties of the gas in relation to lower ionization species. Scientific goals include: 1) A study aimed at comparing highly ionized gas profiles and abundance ratios in interarm and halo sight lines to search for systematic differences predicted by some hot gas theories. 2) A study aimed at discriminating between highly ionized gas produced by photoionization and gas produced by collisional ionization.|Y

Data to very distant (z>3 Kpc) targets suggest the presence of a pervasive, low column density "drizzle" of material of unknown origin. However, this conclusion is uncertain because of a lack of completeness in the sample. In the description of the proposed research program below, the archive data are presented, the shortcomings of the present sample are discussed, and an observing program is outlined which will support or disprove the claims made on the basis of the archive results.|Y

GKJBS|Kinematics of Galactic Halo Gas|B.D.|Savage|Wisconsin-Madison|Important information about the origin of galactic halo gas can be obtained from a study of its motions. We propose to observe 11 distant halo stars in order to study the rotation of halo gas relative to the galactic plane and to study the radial motions of halo gas relative to the galactic center. To minimize the effects of gas motions in the z direction, the objects selected have z ranging from 0.5 to 1.4 kpc and have relatively small | sin b | (<.25 ). An independent study by L. Danly (Univ. of Wis. Ph.D. Thesis, in preparation) is concentrating on a determination of the z motions of halo gas by examining absorption toward objects with large | sin b| (> 0.75). The new observations will be combined with existing data obtained by Savage and Massa (11987) lo answer the following basic questions 1. Does halo gas rotate more slowly than disk gas as predicted by the galactic fountain model? 2. Is there evidence for a radial inflow of cool and warm halo gas toward the center of the galaxy as predicted by the galactic fountain model? 3. Are there differences in the kinematics of gas at 10^4 and 10^5 ?|Y
GKJTS|Chromospheric Activity in the Pleiades Cluster|Theodore|Simon|NASA/GSFC|IUE observations of solar-type stars show a decline in chromospheric and transition region emission with age. For main sequence stars older than 100 million yr, this decay is exponential from a plateau level defined by the youngest stars. X ray observations of the Pleiades cluster, at an age of 75 million yr, suggest that the time decay of coronal emission may not be as straightforward as that described for chromospheric emission, since a number of very luminous X ray stars were found in Einstein surveys of this cluster. I propose here to obtain low resolution Mg II spectra of an X ray-selected sample of late G-K Pleiades members in order to determine whether, from the detection of strong chromospheric emission, the chromospheric activity age law rust be similarly modified. In addition, I propose to measure Mg II fluxes for some rapidly rotating K dwarfs in order to compare the influence of rotation versus rotational shear.|Y
GKOJW|Synoptic Observations of GK Persei|J. Craig|Wheeler|U Texas - Austin|The Intermediate Polar GK Persei has undergone dwarf-nova like outbursts approximately every three years since 1981. The next outburst should occur in 1992. Disk instability models of the outbursts (Kim, Wheeler, and Mineshige 1992) predict a precursor phase in which mass flow in the partially ionized accretion disk should be detectable in the UV, but not in the optical which is contaminated by the companion. The precursor phase should last for one or two months and be the first indication of the imminent outburst. We propose IUE low resolution synoptic monitoring of GK Per to search for the UV precursor. We also propose to follow the major outburst when it erupts. We have been granted IUE discretionary time to periodically monitor GK Per until the beginning of the next IUE episode, but no observations have yet been made.  IUE observations of the upcoming outburst of GK Per will provide a fundamental test to differentiate between the disk instability and mass transfer burst models for the dwarf nova-like outbursts and critical information on time-dependent magnetic accretion in this system.|Y

GPJCM|Anomalous Ultraviolet Extinction|D. Christopher|Martin|Columbia University|Recent spectroscopic and imaging measurements of the far ultraviolet diffuse background have revealed evidence of widespread anomalous dust scattering at the galactic poles. In directions with low HI column density (5 x 10619 cm^-2), scattering by dust of integrated starlight is observed corresponding to an ultraviolet extinction of A(1600A)=0.6-0.8 magnitudes, exceeding the predicted amount of dust by a factor of 7-9. If the extinction behavior of this dust is typical, this would correspond to Av=0.2^m. If the dust is atypically small, the ultraviolet extinction and scattering may be enhanced relative to the visual. We propose to use hot DA white dwarfs to measure the ultraviolet extinction along low HI lines of sight near the galactic poles. We will accurately determine the temperature of the stars with optical measurements of the Balmer lines, and find the absolute extinction in the UV by comparing the model predictions with observed UV fluxes. With this technique, we will be able to measure absolute extinctions of A(1600A)=0.1^m,', corresponding to Av=0.04^m to a galactic height of z=250 pc.|Y

GQJRG|Quasars in Rich Clusters of Galaxies|Richard F.|Green|KPNO|We propose to examine the correlation between quasar environments and the presence of absorption features near the Lyman limit and at CIV. Deep Imaging surveys of radio-loud quasars have Indicated that not only are quasars preferentially situated In regions of high galaxy density, but that the richness of the typical environment has dropped dramatically In the epochs since Z~= 0.6. Theoretical models link these environmental changes to the evolution of the quasar luminosity function. It has been suggested that observed absorptions in CIV with zabs ~ Zem are due to a rich cluster of galaxies situated near the quasar. Absorption at the Lyman limit, while sometimes from lower ionization material, may also arise in the host cluster. We wish to examine absorption features in these two regions for a carefully selected sample of quasars with 0.3 <= z <= 0.65 for which we already have extensive information about environment. A correlation between richness of observed environment and frequency of observed absorption would enable us to verify the proposed nature of these absorbers as well as provide us with a valuable tool for spectrally determining the environment of higher redshift quasars. The spectral energy distributions and line strengths will also be examined for any other effects unique to quasars in rich cluster environments.|Y

GSNAB|A Magnitude-Limited Survey of Single Non-Variable G Supergiants|Alexander|Brown|Colorado - JILA|Where does the 'transition region dividing line' occur for massive (M > 6 YAQ) stars? Is there in fact any dividing line for these massive stars, or does past evolution rather than current position in the HR diagram control the outer atmospheric structure of massive stars when they are G-type supergiants? We propose to answer these presentlyunresolved questions by studying a brightness-limited sample (with V < 4.8) of single, non-variable G supergiants, that includes all such stars within roughly 800 parsecs of the Sun for Ib supergiants and 4 kpc for Is supergiants. The outer atmospheric layers of these stars are poorly understood and our investigation will fill this gap in our understanding. We shall determine the relative frequency of coronal, non-coronal, and hybrid outer atmospheric structure among these stars. The range of chromospheric and transition region properties will be quantitatively investigated using emission measure analysis and radiative transfer modelling. Observed CNO,^12C/^13C ratios, and IR excesses will be used to study correlations between the atmospheric properties and the evolutionary state of the star. The observed chromospheric and TR structure will hopefully be related to major alterations of the stellar internal structure, such as changes in convection zone depth, angular momentum distribution and the onset of Hecore burning. This is precisely the type of systematic survey aimed at answering fundamental questions that IUE can and should do in its mature phase.|Y

GXIJS|Anomalous X-Ray Selected Stars|John T.|Stocke|Colorado - CASA|For the first time a large, statistically complete sample of bright stars selected solely by their xray emission is available to us. These stars constitute approximately 25% of all xray sources in the range -11 < log fx < -13.5 ergs s^-1cm^-2 in the soft xray band and currently number approximately 200 in what we term the expanded Einstein Medium Sensitivity Survey (MSS; Maccacaro et al 1987; Stocke et al 1983; Gioia et al 1984). The actual stellar content of this sample is significantly different from what is expected from Einstein xray observations of preselected normal stars of a variety of spectral types: there is an excess of G and K stars (Favata et al 1986). Optical spectroscopic observations of a few of the G and K stars strongly suggest that a majority of these stars are binary systems similar to the RS CVn binaries although rapidly rotating and perhaps pre-main sequence stars may also contribute (Silva et al 1985, 1986). Thus xray emission offers a new and very sensitive method for finding stars with abnormal levels of activity.  IUE low dispersion observations with the SWP and LWP cameras are proposed for a handful of these xray selected stars. Out of 200 stars we have chosen the few that are anomalous based upon their extremely high xray to optical flux ratios. The purpose of these observations is to search for anomalous chromospheric activity in these stars related to their unusual xray emission.|Y

HALSS|The Wind of the Herbig AE/BE Star HD 37806|Steven N.|Shore|NMIT|We propose to study the wind structure, abundances, and time variability of the envelope of the pre-main sequence Be star HD 37806. This star is a member of Ori OB1, has a known age and distance, and is a star for which absolute parameters can be determined. HD 37806 is a very close match to the well studied Ae/Be star AB Aur, and the comparison affords a unique opportunity to study the dynamics and energetics of two moderately massive stars settling down onto the main sequence. The chromosphere of AB Aur, and likely also of HD 37806, accounts for about ten percent of the bolometric radiative losses. The comparison of these two stars will be important in detailing the mechanism, presently unknown, for generating such enormous energy output.|Y
HAMAB|HI-RES IUE Observations of HD 104237, The Brightest Herbig AE STA R|Alexander|Brown|Colorado|We propose to study the transition region emission line (C IV, Si IV) profiles of HD104237, the UV and optically brightest and closest Herbig Ae star. The existing single-shift (300, 320 min.) SWP-HI exposures of HD104237 already give better line profiles for lines such as O I than the 778 min. SWP-HI image of HR5999, the star with the next brightest transition region (TR) emission lines. However the TR lines of HD104237, while visible, are still only poorly exposed and summation of these images does not provide line profiles of useable quality. We propose to obtain a double shift (z 900 min.) SWP-HI exposure of HD104237 that will provide good line profiles for several emission line including the Si IV and C IV lines formed in the TR of HD104237. These observations will be unique because they will allow us to investigate for the first time the influence of the stellar wind of a Herbig Ae star on its transition region. In particular, we will search for evidence for blue-shifted wind absorption in these line profiles.|Y
HAMTS|Activity Cycle of the Herbig AE Star AB Aurigae|Theodore|Simon|Hawaii|IUE spectra of the pre-main sequence Ae star AB Aurigae exhibit periodic changes in the displacement of the violet edge of the Mg II resonance lines on rotational time scales of 35-45 hours. This modulation in velocity may be induced by a stellar magnetic field, which organizes the wind of AD Aurigae into a pattern of alternating fastand slowmoving streams. As those streams corotate with the star and cross the line of sight, they modulate the shape of the Mg II line profiles. A strong argument for a magnetic origin of the observed variability would be the detection of a long-term stellar activity cycle. Our past observations, consisting of four series of spectra acquired between 1982 and 1988, show definite evidence for a long-term change in both the mean wind velocity and the velocity amplitude, but as yet there is no proof these changes are part of a long-term activity cycle. In this proposal we request additional observing time with IUE for further monitoring of AD Aurigae, so that we can determine whether theme longterm changes are continuing. The detection of any long-term trend in activity has important consequences for models of AB Aurigae, and for the Ae/Be stars in general. If such changes prove to be cyclic, they will also have far reaching consequences for the theory of stellar dynamos and stellar magnetism.|Y

HBHYK|Investigation of the Peculiar Secondary Eclipse of the Interacting Binary R Arae|Yoji|Kondo|NASA/GSFC|Several high resolution IUE spectra of the strongly interacting binary R Arae near phase 0.61 have detected a secondary eclipse which has the very peculiar property of deepening at shorter wavelengths. It is 0^m.20 deep in the blue and O^m.75 deep at 1300. This cannot occur for normal stars. Presumably hot or cold spots of large size or circumstellar gas with significant optical thickness could give rise to this phenomenon. We propose to observe R Arae from phase 0.5 to 0.7 at both high and low resolutions in order to obtain detailed information on continuum and line variations in order to construct a model for the regions involved and to relate this model to the evolutionary state of R Arae.|Y
HBJAP|UV Observations of FHB Stars|A. G.|Davis Phillip|Inst. Sp Obs.|The main aim of the proposal is to obtain UV spectrophotometric data to be used in correcting ATLAS model atmospheres, which at the present time give incorrect values of the surface gravity of Pop II early-type stars. We wish to confirm the membership of FHB candidate stars as members of Pop II by comparing their spectra to those of early-type Pop I stars. The Pop II stars have a distinctly different spectral distribution in the UV. There are at least three subgroups of FHB stars and since this proposal will double the number of FHB with UV spectra we will be able to make a better analysis of the physical properties of each group. The results of these studies will help shed some light on what problems might exist in the ATLAS models to cause the surface gravities to have systematic errors.|Y
HBOAB|Origin of Hydrogen Balmer Emission from Stellar Flares on M Dwarfs|Alexander|Brown|Colorado - JILA|The processes leading to the production of Hydrogen Balmer emission lines during stellar flares has recently received further discussion due to the discovery that the integrated Balmer and soft X-ray flux from flares are strongly correlated. Possible explanations for this correlation include that the Balmer emission results directly from photo-excitation by the X-ray and EUV emission from the flare, that X-rays and optical emission lines both come from plasma cooling in the gradual phase of the flare, that radiative transfer effects associated with chromospheric compression by the flare result in enhanced Balmer emission, and that residual heating occurs during the gradual phase.  We propose simultaneous UV (IUE), X-ray/EUV (ROSAT), and optical (SAAO, ESO) observations of the flare star Gliese 867A (at least one flare with a factor 2 increase in U is expected every 8 hours) to test these various possible excitation mechanisms for the Balmer emission during stellar flares, and the inter-relationship between the Balmer emission and emission in other spectral regions. ROSAT observations of Gl 867, allocated in the AO-1 program are planned for the next available ROSAT observing window, 9 May - 9 June 1992, with the best time for coordinated ground-based observations being 5-9 June.|Y
HBOAP|Ultraviolet Observations of Field Horizontal-Branch Stars|A. G. Davis|Philip|Institute for Space Obs.|The principal aim of this proposal is to obtain UV spectrophotometric observations of candidate stars, most of which are likely to be Field Horizontal-Branch A Stars. Both the class members and the photometric interlopers are interesting in their own right. Population II stars have ultraviolet spectral energy distributions which are clearly different compared to Population I stars. We want to use the UV data in combination with the predicted fluxes of Kurucz's new ATLAS models to derive better estimates of the temperatures and the surface gravities. There are at least three subgroups of FHB stars and since this proposal will substantially increase the number of such stars with UV spectra, we will be able to make a better analysis of the physical properties of each group.|Y

HCEEB|Search for & Study of Hot Companions of Cepheids|Erika|Bohm-Vitense|Washington|Studies of the track of cepheid colors in the two color diagram during their pulsational cycle reveals that some cepheids show an additional blue light source, which is presumably due to a blue companion roughly two or three magnitudes fainter than the cepheid in the visual. During one exploratory shift we have taken low resolution short wavelength IUE spectra of 5 suspected binaries. Four of them did indeed show the spectrum of a hot companion. We suggest to take well exposed spectra of these companions in order to determine spectral type and luminosities. We also want to search for hot companions in other suspected cepheid binaries.|Y
HCEHB|A Search for White-Dwarf Companions of Subgiant CH Stars|Howard E.|Bond|Louisiana State|Barium stars and CH stars are red giants showing enhanced carbon and heavy element abundances at their surfaces. These anomalies are attributed to nuclear reactions (helium burning and s-processing) that occur deep in stellar interiors. Renewed interest in Ba II stars has arisen from the discovery by groundbased observers that many barium stars are spectroscopic binaries, and from the discovery with IUE of a white-dwarf companion to the brightest barium star, Zeta Capricorni. The subgiant CH stars are F- and G-type stars lying on or near the main sequence, but having carbon and s-process enhancements similar to those of CH and Ba II stars. Objective-prism surveys carried out by Bond have recently revealed several dozen such stars. We plan to use IUE to search for evidence of white-dwarf companions of subgiant CH stars in their ultraviolet spectra. Although our program stars have visual magnitudes of 7-9, they are actually at smaller distances than 3rd-magnitude Zeta Capricorni (since they have much lower luminosities). Therefore they provide ideal objects for a test of the hypothesis that late-type stars with s-process enhancements result from mass transfer or other binary-star phenomena, rather than from interior mixing during evolution of single stars.|Y
HCETA|Observations of Cool Giants & Supergiants with Hot Companions|Thomas B.|Ake|CSC|We propose to observe middle and late-type giant and supergiant stars whose TD1 and A14S fluxes indicate the presence of a hot component. The supergiants apparently have main sequence companions which can be used to derive more accurate luminosities for the primaries than can be done now for individual supergiants. Evidence for enhanced mass loss from the secondaries, as is seen in some systems of this kind, will be examined. Ultimately this group will be useful in calibrating the upper end of the Wilson-Bappu relation Our selected cool giants have more highly evolved subluminous and degenerate secondaries. High dispersion observations in the long wavelength region where the primary still dominates will yield information about the changes in chromospheric structure and remnant mass flows due to the proximity of the hot companion, while low dispersion, short wavelength region observations will be used to study the secondaries themselves. Comparisons will be made between these objects and the Ba II stars with hot companions that have been observed with IUE. Our objects, which have normal abundances, are counter-examples to the suggestion that the compositional peculiarities of the Ba II stars arise from mass transfer effects.|Y
HCFEB|Cepheid Companions and Masses|Erica|Bohm-Vitense|University of Washington|We want to observe hot companions of Cepheids. Cepheids with open loops in their tracks in the two color diagram during the pulsational cycle are suspected to have hot companions, causing these loops. From our present studies and also those of Gieren (1982, Ap.J. Suppl. 49, 1) we conclude that some of the open loops are intrinsic to the star. We suspect that open loops are intrinsic to Population II and intermediate population Cepheids but not to Pop I Cepheids. We want to check whether this hypothesis is true.  If hot companions are found we want to study the evolutionary state of the companion. If it has evolved off the main sequence the companion and the Cepheid must fall on the same evolutionary track. We can check in this way whether present evolutionary calculations are correct. The study of the companions of SV Per and RW Cam indicate that something might be in error, see Fig. 1.  If Cepheid and companion are bright enough and have comparable brightness at about 2500A. both radial velocities may be measured on high resolution LWR images. With known orbital and pulsational velocity of the Cepheid the ratio of orbital velocities and therefore the mass ratio of the companions can be determined. From spectral type and luminosity the mass of the companion can be obtained and then the mass of the Cepheid. We have taken LWR high resolution images of of S Mus, V636 Sco, SU Cyg, W Sgr. The measured radial velocities need confirmation. SU Cyg appears to have a companion which itself is a binary.|Y
HCFHB|A Search for White-Dwarf Companions of Subgiant CH Stars|Howard E.|Bond|Louisiana State|Barium stars and CH stars are red giants showing enhanced carbon and s-process abundances at their surfaces. These anomalies are attributed to nuclear reactions (helium burning and neutron captures) that occur deep in stellar interiors.  Renewed interest in Ba II stars has arisen from the discovery by ground-based observers that many barium stars are spectroscopic binaries, and from the discovery with IUE of a white-dwarf companion of the brightest barium star, *Zeta Capricorni. The more recently discovered subgiant CH stars are F- and G-type stars lying on or near the main sequence, but having carbon and s-process enhancements similar to those of CH and Ba II stars. Objectiveprism surveys carried out by Bond have recently revealed several dozen such stars.We plan to use IUE to search for evidence of white-dwarf companions of subgiant CH stars in their ultraviolet spectra. Although our program stars have visual magnitudes of 810, they are actually at smaller distances than 3rd-magnitude Zeta Cap (since they have much lower luminosities). Therefore they provide the best possible circumstances for a test of the hypothesis that late-type peculiar stars result from mass transfer or other binary-star phenomena, rather than from interior mixing during evolution of single stars.|Y
HCFSP|Mass Ratios of Binary Stars with Luminous Cool Primaries and Hot Secondaries|Sidney B.|Parsons|NASA/GSFC|Very little mass information has been available for luminous F and G stars from ground-based work. Accurate information on mass is essential in developing viable theoretical models on stellar structure and evolution. Therefore, it is proposed to continue our IUE observations of single-lined spectroscopic binaries containing F or G giant or supergiant primaries and hot (B or A) secondaries to obtain such information. Relative radial velocities with an accuracy of 2 - 3 km/s will be obtained for the early and late type components by the cross correlation of high-dispersion LWR spectra of these composite systems with appropriate standard star spectra. From the known velocity behavior of the late-type star, a mass ratio can be obtained. A main sequence mass for the early-type star can be reliably estimated from its temperature, obtained from low-dispersion UV spectra. The mass of the latetype star will then be measured with greater precision than by any other technique such as spectroscopic surface gravities. This will permit improved comparisons with evolutionary theory for single stars if the binaries are noninteracting. If the binary is in interactive type, the results will be useful in developing an understanding of the evolutionary processes in interacting binaries. In addition, serendipitous discoveries may result as a byproduct. One system at least (22 Vul) shows evidence of a substantial stellar wind, and further observations are necessary to determine what part if any the binary nature of the system plays in this process.|Y
HCGBC|Ultraviolet Observations of Blue Stragglers and Halo K Dwarfs|Bruce W.|Carney|North Carolina|We propose to carry out IUE observations of two classes of old, cool stars in order to search for white-dwarf companions.  Blue stragglers are stars in globular clusters and old open clusters that lie on or near the main sequence but are well above the turnoff point for the majority of the cluster members. One proposed explanation for the origin of blue stragglers is that they are the former secondary stars of close-binary systems; if they have received sufficient mass via mass transfer from their companions, they could have moved up the main sequence to their observed positions. If this mechanism is correct, the former primary star might now be a white dwarf that could be detected with IUE. We plan to carry out IUE observations of three field blue stragglers that are already known to be radial velocity variables, and of a member of the old open cluster NGC 7789 with anomalous optical colors, to see whether they have the white-dwarf companions predicted by this scenario.  Recently, several field halo K dwarfs have been discovered to have abnormally large ultraviolet excesses(from ground-based photometry). The UV excesses might be due to ultra-low metallicity, so that these K dwarfs could represent a heretofore unknown class of objects. However, an alternative explanation could be that these K dwarfs have white-dwarf companions that contaminate the optical colors. IUE observations will provide a straightforward test of these two possibilities, thus shedding light on the question of the existence of "Population III" stars.|Y
HCGTA|Observations of Cool Giants and Supergiants with Hot Companions|Thomas B.|Ake|CSC|We propose to observe middle and late-type giant and supergiant stars whose TD-1 and ANS fluxes indicate the presence of a hot component. Some of the secondaries are seen weakly in optical spectra but cannot be classified accurately, while others are UV discoveries. The companions apparently lie on the main sequence, and thus can be used to derive more accurate luminosities than can now be done for individual giants and supergiants. Since the companions contribute little light in the optical region, ultimately this group can be useful in calibrating the upper end of the Wilson-Bappu relations. Evidence for enhanced mass loss for the secondaries or warm plasma around the stars, as seen in some systems of this kind, will be examined.|Y
HCGTT|Stellar Populations in Galaxies with Active Star Formation|Trinh X.|Thuan|Virginia|We propose to perform stellar synthesis of the UV spectra in the IUE archives of 10 blue compact dwarf galaxies and 17 starburst galaxies to study star-forming processes in galaxies. The stellar populations derived from the spectral synthesis will permit the following studies: 1) a comparison of the stellar populations in blue compact dwarf galaxies and galactic nuclei; 2) the dependence of the initial mass function on the metallicity content; 3) the dust content and the extinction curve in blue compact dwarf galaxies and galactic nuclei; 4) the dependence of the star formation rate on environment and 5) the interplay between stellar and nonthermal phenomena in galactic nuclei.|Y
HCHBB|Interacting F + BE Binary Stars|Bernard W.|Bopp|Toledo|Several binary star systems containing an F giant or bright giant and a Be component, all showing strong H-alpha emission, are to be examined at middle or far ultraviolet wavelengths at several orbital phases each. Previous IUE observations of some of these systems show strong MgII emission which varies in intensity and profile an a timescale of at least a few days. In one case the UV spectrum of an F + Be star showed a change in flux by a factor of two and a change in nature from a complex absorption line spectrum similar to the interacting binary SX Cas to a more conventional hot star plus mild wind. We wish to learn to what extent these binaries are related to or differ from the 'W Serpentis' binary systems containing hot plasma. High-resolution UV spectroscopy will be feasible and will give insight into the probable location of the plasma (envelope or accretion disc around the hot star, gas streams, and/or extended atmosphere of the cool star) and evolutionary status of these systems and related objects.|Y
HCHDL|A Search for White Dwarf Companions of Asymptotic Giant Branch Stars|David L.|Lambert|Texas|A search will be carried out for hot, degenerate companions of red giant stars whose atmospheres show evidence of recent contamination by the products of Heburning nucleosynthesis. Observational data will consist-of IUE short wavelength spectra of Peculiar M giants whose chemical compositions have already been determined by Smith and Lambert (1984). Many of these stars appear to be true asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars undergoing thermal pulses and the resultant dredge-up of 12C and s-process material. However, as is the case with the G and K giant Barium stars, mass transfer across a binary system may turn a normal star into one whose composition mimics that of an AGB star. In understanding stellar evolution, the question of whether a peculiar red giant is the result of its own internal processes or the result of mass transfer from a more highly evolved companion is of crucial importance. Many of the stars in Smith and Lambert's study show the presence of the unstable element technetium (half-life = 2 x 10^5 yr), thus if they are the result of mass transfer from a former AGB companion, the remnant stellar core must be hot and luminous; an ideal target for IUE. Lack of a hot companion will provide hard evidence that Smith and Lambert have indeed analyzed true AGB stars whose peculiar compositions are the result of internal processes and, hence, key objects in our understanding of the late stages of stellar evolution.|Y
HCIFF|Search for White Dwarf Companions of Chromospherically Active Giants|Francis C.|Fekel|Vanderrbilt|A few RS CVn binaries have orbital and rotational periods which are not synchronous. One possible explanation for these systems is that mass transfer has changed the orbital period. Thus, we will search for white dwarfs which would be the remnants of mass transfer.|Y
HCJSK|Accretion in SY Fornacis|Scott J.|Kenyon|CFA SAO|SY For presents an important opportunity to investigate accretion processes in an evolved Pop II binary system. UV continuum observations will allow us to determine the structure of the accretion region surrounding the hot component, and thus test hydrodynamic models for wind accretion. Information concerning CNO abundances in the wind ejected by the M giant can be derived from an emission line analysis, and then compared to dredge-up models for evolved red giant stars.|Y
HCJTA|Hot Companions to S and MS Stars|Thomas B.|Ake|CSC|Stars of type MS and S are those descendents of K and M giants which have been enriched in sprocess elements and perhaps also in carbon. Generally they must be asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars which have begun the third dredge-up, and therefore, lie evolutionarily between M stars and N-type carbon stars. A few of these stand out, however, in being non-variable and possessing no Tc, and thus appear to be more closely related to Ba II stars than to K-M giants or carbon stars. A few are already known to have white dwarf companions, and exhibit hightemperature UV emission lines indicating the components are close enough for mass-transfer to have occurred. We will systematically search a larger group for such companions to determine which may owe their peculiar abundances to their binarity.|Y
HCKEB|Blue Companions of Supergiants|Erika|Bohm-Vitense|Washington|We would like to observe blue companions of supergiants in star clusters. For binaries in clusters we know the distance with some accuracy. IUE observations of blue companions of supergiants therefore tell their absolute magnitudes, so we can decide whether we are dealing with giants or main sequence stars. Because of the short evolution times along the giant branch the supergiants and evolved companions must have essentially the same mass. They then outline two points on an evolutionary track. For other apparently giant stars in the cluster we can never be sure about their membership. The luminosity difference between a supergiant and a giant of the same mass depends on the degree of mixing in the interior of the main sequence progenitor star, which can therefore be determined empirically by studying the luminosity difference between the supergiant and a giant companion. As all supergiants in a cluster must have essentially the same mass a dynamical mass determination for a supergiant in a cluster with Cepheids also determines the mass of the Cepheid.|Y
HCKTA|WD Companions to TC-Deficient Peculiar Red Giants|Thomas B.|Ake|CSC ST|Stars of type MS. S, and C are those descendents of K and M giants which show evidence of CNO processing and enrichment in s-process elements. While generally they are thought to be asymptotic giant branch stars which have begun the third dredge-up, recent abundance determinations indicate that the M-MS-S-SC-C sequence may not be a simple evolutionary one and that the peculiar red giants are a heterogeneous mixture of objects with different evolutionary histories. One subgroup of these, the objects possessing no technitium, appear to be more closely related to Ba II stars than to K-M giants and may have been mass-transfer binaries in the past. A few are already known to have white dwarf companions, and exhibit high-temperature UV emission lines indicating the components are close enough for mass transfer to have occurred. We will systematically search a larger group for such companions to determine which may owe their peculiar abundances to their binarity.|Y
HCLSP|Cool Giants and Supergiants with Hot Companions|Sidney B.|Parsons|CSC|We propose to observe middle and late-type giant and supergiant stars whose TD-1 fluxes or ground-based spectra indicate the presence of a hot component. Some of the secondaries are seen weakly in optical spectra but cannot be classified accurately, while others are UV discoveries. The companions apparently lie on the upper main sequence, thus their accurate temperature classifications from the IUE spectra will lead to good estimates of their luminosities. These in turn can be used to derive more accurate luminosities than can now be done for individual giants and supergiants. Since the companions contribute little light in the optical region, ultimately this group can be useful in calibrating the upper end of the Wilson-Bappu relationship. We will pursue an enigma that many giant stars apparently have companions which are too hot for consistency with the primary's spectral classification. Combined with previous observations, this project will yield a total sample of more than 80 giant or supergiant absolute magnitudes, enabling both a firmer statistical base for luminosity calibrations and an opportunity to investigate temperature dependence of such calibrations.|Y
HCMMJ|In Search of Possible Companions to Three Anomalous Carbon Stars|Michael A.|Jura|UCLA|We propose to search for evidence of an accretion disk around possible companions to the three anomalous carbon stars EU And, V 778 Cyg, and BM Gem. These carbonrich Asymptotic Giant Branch stars are peculiar because they are believed to possess oxygen-rich circumstellar envelopes. Evidence for this unusual characteristic stems from their observed strong 9.8 micron silicate feature and in some cases, circumstellar H20 maser emission, and from their very low 60 micron to 25 micron flux ratio (F [60]/F[25]). Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain these observations, some of which point toward a possible binary membership of these stars. The detection of UV emission with the IUE satellite would provide strong observational evidence in support of this scenario.|Y
HCPSP|Affirmative Data for Cool + Hot Binary Systems|Sidney B.|Parsons|CSC - STScI|We propose to observe middle and late-type giant and supergiant stars whose previous IUE spectra indicate the presence of a hot component, but which lack adequate IUE exposures for definitive analysis. Some of the secondaries are seen weakly in optical spectra but cannot be classified accurately, while others are UV discoveries. The companions apparently lie on the upper main sequence, thus their accurate temperature classifications from the IUE spectra will lead to good estimates of their luminosities. These in turn can be used to derive more accurate luminosities than can now be done for individual giants and supergiants.

HDIMP|The Hydrogen-Deficient Binary Upsilon Sagittarii|Mirek J.|Plavec|CAL LA|I propose to obtain additional observations of the extremely hydrogen-poor star Upsilon Sagittarii. The purpose is: (1) To obtain the correct flux distribution for both components and compare it with new model atmosphere fluxes appropriate for hydrogen-poor stars, to be generated by Dr. R.L. Kurucz.  (2) To attempt to estimate the radial velocity range of the hotter component of the system, by measuring its line shifts in high-dispersion IUE spectra.  (3) To decide if the system is an eclipsing one, in which case the orbital inclination would be better known, and we would obtain a better picture of the masses and dimensions. These in turn are important for comparing the observed system with the models of binary star evolution with mass transfer and/or mass loss. At the present, a highly non-conservative process is indicated.  Observing time is needed at phases close to phases 0.0 and 0.50, then at a phase near 0.9 (corresponding to actual conjunction) and at one other phase, preferably near either 0.25 or 0.75.  The rich collection of the existing high-dispersion spectra will be used for determining the radial velocities as mentioned in (2). But they were taken with a narrow slit and therefore cannot be used for photometric studies, needed to realize points (1) and (3). Nearly simultaneous observations are being arranged with Dr. R.S. Polidan for the Voyager spectrometer.|Y
HDOMP|High Dispersion Study of BB1|Miriam|Pena|UNAM - Mexico|Several of the extreme Population II planetary nebulae are underabundant in S and Ar by factors of about 100, relative to solar values, while O and Ne are underabundant by factors of 10. To explain this it has been argued that the excesses in O and Ne relative to S and Ar have been produced by the progenitor stars themselves (Peimbert 1991) in disagreement with current evolutionary models of low-mass stars. The halo planetary nebula BB-1, which is S and Ar poor, shows the highest Ne/O value and it is extremely C-rich. We propose to obtain high resolution SWP and LWP IUE spectra to determine more accurate physical conditions and chemical composition of this object.  We are specially interested in determining C/O, N/O and Ne/O ratios for which, observations of their UV multiplets are fundamental. The results will provide important constraints to stellar evolution models of low-mass stars.|Y
HDPJH|IUE Echelle Spectra of an EUV Selected Sample of Hot DA White Dwarfs|Jay B.|Holberg|U Arizona|We propose to obtain high dispersion IUE SWP spectra of five hot white DA dwarfs discovered as EUV sources by the ROSAT Wide Field Camera. Recent studies of DA white dwarfs detected by ROSAT reveal that it is not possible to account for the observed EUV and soft X-ray fluxes with simple He opacity alone. Until now virtually all analyses of DA soft X-ray observations have been interpreted in terms of trace He abundances, in either a homogeneous or stratified photosphere. It is now clear that other opacity sources will be required to interpret these observations, in particular opacity due to metal ions. Our proposed observations will seek direct evidence that such ions are indeed responsible for the soft X-ray opacity in these stars. We also will obtain large and small aperture spectra of each star in order to accurately establish the temperatures and gravities.|Y

HEEAH|IUE Observations of High Luminosity Helium Pulsational Variables|Albert V.|Holm|CSC|The hydrogen-deficient carbon stars R CrB and RY Sgr show a pulsational variability that apparently is the helium star analogue of the Cepheid phenomenon. We propose to observe the spectrum and energy distribution of RY Sgr through one pulsational cycle of 38 days. We anticipate that the ultraviolet spectrophotometry will permit the separation of the effects of temperature changes and variable circumstellar extinction that have caused attempts to apply Wesselink's method to visual data -co produce negative radii. Accurate temperatures will be derived from the shape of the ultraviolet energy distribution and combined with radial velocities from the IUE high dispersion spectra to compute luminosities via Wesselink's method. This effort should produce the first accurate luminosities for these evolved stars and will permit improved determination of their evolutionary significance. The high dispersion spectra will also be used to study the variations of the Mg II emission fluxes with phase. Differences between the emission line activity in this star and in Cepheid variables will be explored for relevance to the internal and atmospheric structure of the helium-carbon star. Finally. the high dispersion spectra will be searched for possible phase-dependent shell absorption lines. Such lines would be expected if the dust grains that cause the characteristic R CrB type fading are formed in gas clouds ejected from the stellar surface by erratic pulsation. Their presence or absence will provide evidence regarding the mechanism that produces the fading.|Y
HEEES|High Resolution Ultraviolet Studies of Hot Helium Rich White Dwarfs|Edward M.|Sion|Villanova|We propose to observe two hot helium-rich white dwarfs, each with T(e)>50,OOOK, in the high dispersion mode. Our targets represent two distinctly different types of hot helium-rich (DO) degenerates, a "cooler" type, HD149499B, showing no definite photospheric metal features, and a much hotter temperature class object, PG1034+001 with Teru70,OOO-8O,OOOK exhibiting weak metal lines in low dispersion IUE spectra. These two stars are the only known helium-rich (DO) degenerates bright enough to be observed at high resolution. Our objectives are to (1) search for the existence of selective ion winds theoretically expected in hot helium-rich degenerates, (2) search for a static or slowly expanding hot circumstellar shell or ionization region and (3) detect weak photospheric lines whose presence or absence would be a highly important test of diffusion theory in hot degenerate stars.|Y
HEEGW|Ultraviolet Study of Helium (DB) White Dwarfs|Gary A.|Wegner|Penn State|During the past two years, several white dwarfs with Teff < 12000 K have been found that show strong lines of neutral carbon in the ultraviolet. All of these objects belong to the helium rich sequence of the white dwarfs and have been given spectral classes of DC or C(2) on the basis of their visible wavelength spectra. One class of apparently related white dwarfs, are the DB with 30 000 K > Teff > 12 OOO K. These stars are hot enough to show He I lines and a few of these objects also show HI and Ca II features in their visual spectra. It is not known whether carbon is present in the atmospheres of all, some, or none of these helium rich DB white dwarfs. Model atmosphere calculations indicate that if the abundance of carbon is the same in the DBs as in the DC and C(2) stars, lines of Cl should be observable in the cooler DBs with IUE. Consequently, it is proposed that a number of DBs be looked at with IUE in order to ascertain whether or not all of the DB could cool into white dwarfs with ultraviolet carbon lines. More generally, these observations could yield new information on the relative importance of connecting mixing, gravitational settling, and accretion in the outer layers of the white dwarfs.|Y
HEESS|Spectroscopy & Zeeman Polarimetry of Helium Rich Magnetospheres & Winds|Steven N.|Shore|Case Western Reserve|The helium-rich stars (hot analogs of the Ap stars) have strong magnetic fields which vary, in phase with the spectrum and photometric variations, on the stellar rotation period. Previous IUE spectra suggest an oblique rotator model for these stars in which mass loss occurs via a stellar wind arising in plumes from the magnetic polar regions, while circumstellar material is trapped above the magnetic equator. Prior IUE observations of both fast and slow rotators show redward emission and blueshifted absorption components to UV resonance lines; the presence and phase-dependent strength of these features depend strongly on the stellar rotation. This investigation is proposed to obtain phase resolved simultaneous observations of the UV resonance lines, Balmer line profiles, and magnetic field strength for two helium-rich stars whose intermediate rotation rate places them in a transition region between the fast and slow rotators. Thus the observations will elucidate the critical interaction of magnetic, rotational, and radiative forces in the heliumrich stars; the results of this program will also influence our general understanding of angular momentum loss through magnetic braking by a stellar wind--which in turn may have import for aspects of massive star evolution.|Y
HEFDB|Mass Loss and Photospheric Structure in Early-Type Spectrum Variables|Douglas N.|Brown|Washington|Magnetically-controlled stellar winds have recently been discovered on several helium-strong stars, thereby expanding the known mass loss domain of the upper main sequence. Observations of helium-strong stars having different rotational periods reveal a complex interplay of magnetic, radiative and rotational forces in determining the character of the winds. The helium-weak stars are somewhat cooler than the helium-strong stars and have recently been found to possess strong magnetic fields. It is proposed to investigate the possibility of magnetically controlled mass loss in helium-weak stars by observing UV resonance wind features. Comparison of magnetic and non-magnetic, rapidly- and slowly-rotating candidates in a range of temperatures will elucidate the relative importance of magnetic, radiative, and rotational forces.  In parallel, and using the same IUE observations, measurement of UV photospheric diagnostic features will make it possible to disentangle the contributions of temperature, abundance, and electron density inhomogeneity in producing the observed spectrum and photometric variations.|Y
HEFES|Ultraviolet Studies of the Hot, Pulsating Helium-Rich Degenerate Stars|Edward|Sion|Villanova|We propose to observe four hot, pulsating helium-rich white dwarfs (PG1159 stars), each with T(e) >100,OOO K, in the low resolution mode. These four objects are among the hottest stars known and the very hottest known white dwarfs. Our detailed synthetic spectrum/ hybrid composition model atmospheres with the first to be available ultraviolet metal line profiles at high gravity, will be used to analyse the strong, numerous, ultraviolet photospheric absorption features in the PG1159 stars. our analysis of the IUE spectra of PG1159 stars will yield more accurate determinations of gravities, abundances and the effective temperatures independent of energy distribution fits. Our scientific objectives are threefold: (1) to establish a vitally needed temperature scale for the DO degenerates including the uppermost temperature range; (2) to determine bounds on the instability strip for hot helium-rich degenerates and to use our T(e), log g and abundances in order to understand the pulsational driving mechanism(s) of the PG1159 stars and (3) to test the theoretical predictions of gravitational diffusion/radiative acceleration theory by utilizing our derived metal abundances as a function of effective temperature.|Y
HEFSS|Spectrophotometry of Helium Peculiar Stars|Steven N.|Shore|Case Western Reserve|The mechanism for the spectrum and photometric variations of the magnetic helium peculiar stars is not a settled question. For the cooler stars the primary cause appears to be changes, due to surface inhomogeneities, of Si continuous opacity.  For the hotter helium rich stars it appears linked to the helium anomaly and its photosoheric distribution. The connection between the helium weak and helium rich stars is not well understood but appears to be linked to effective temperature on the main sequence via a diffusion mechanism. The purpose of this study is to explore the relation between magnetic field strength and configuration, effective temperature and abundance anomaly using groups of matched He weak and He rich stars. It will, using this sample, also study the relation between the UV variations and the broad continuum features known in the optical at 5200 and 6300 A. The constancy of the stellar flux will also be studied, linking this survey with the OAO-2 and TD-1 studies of a few Si stars. A subsidiary goal is the calibration of high dispersion IUE Spectra obtained in the previous programs (APBSA, HRDPB, and HEESS) for the helium rich stars. The photometric observations made with OAO-2, TD-1, ANS, and the COPERNICUS spectra will all serve as links between the helium rich and weak phenomenology.|Y
HEGJL|A High Dispersion Spectrum of the Hot Pulsating White Dwarf PG1159-035|James W.|Liebert|Arizona|We propose to obtain a 15-hour high dispersion spectrum of the important hot white dwarf PG1159-035, using back-to-back European and US1 shifts. This star lies at the juxtaposition of the hottest white dwarfs, central stars of planetary nebulae, and the hot subdwarf O stars. It is also the prototype of a new class of pulsating stars. Knowing its precise H-R diagram position is crucial to utilizing detailed studies of the pulsational properties, and the atmospheric composition may be useful in assessing the driving mechanism. Determination of its stellar parameters requires careful study of absorption features lying at SWP wavelengths. The nature of weak emission lines seen in the optical may also be discernible.|Y
HEJES|Echelle Studies of Helium-Rich White Dwarfs|Edward M.|Sion|Villanova|We propose to observe two different spectroscopic types of hot helium-rich white dwarfs, a DB GD358, and a DO HZ21, in the high dispersion mode. Our targets represent the first helium-rich degenerates, below 50000K to be observed with the IUE echelle. one target, GD358 (the first DB ever to be observed with the echelle) is the pulsating prototype of a group of DB stars exhibiting non-radial, g-mode oscillations and lies in temperature near the blue edge of the DB instability strip at the lower boundary of the DO/DB gap. The other target, HZ21 lies at the upper boundary of the DO/DB gap and represents the coolest of only four DO stars that were accessible to IUE echelle observations. This downward extension in temperature of our echelle studies of helium-rich white dwarfs, has the following scientific objectives: (1) to search for evidence of recent or ongoing mass loss undetectable at low IUE resolution but detected with the IUE echelle among hotter helium-rich (DO) stars and some DA stars of comparable Teff as our targets; (2) to search for evidence of sharp ionized metal absorption features formed in and/or far above the photosphere due either to radiative forces levitation, convective dredge-up or interstellar accretion and look for evidence of a sharp non-LTE line core at HeII (1640) in HZ21; (3) to derive metal abundances of detected features thus providing a critical test of radiative forces/diffusion theory in hot, helium-rich degenerates at lower temperatures; to derive a more stringent upper limit carbon/helium abundance for a DB star; (4) to use the abundances and mix of detected ions together with upper limit rotational velocities from their FWHM to test theoretical scenarios for DB formation, the DO/DB gap and the DO ----> DB evolutionary link. A comparison of HZ21 with the hotter DO stars is crucial to identifying its progenitor channel.|Y
HEJSS|The Sn Stars|Steven N.|Shore|New Mexico Tech|The aim of this project is to study a class of helium weak stars for which anisotropic, magnetically controlled stellar winds have been discovered. Three extreme helium weak stars have been found with IUE to be C IV variables: HD 5737, 21699, and 79158. The periods are not well constrained, especially for HD 5737, and the relative phasing of the variations in the magnetic frame cannot currently be given. This is critical for determining the properties of the outflow. All three stars have been found serendipitously to be members of the in class. A fourth, HD 161480, appears to be an analog of HD 5737 and may display the same wind phenomena. The fundamental result of this project will be the detailed study of the relation between the photospheric magnetic field and the structure of the stellar wind in a unique and well specified group of helium peculiar stars. This will provide important information about the mechanisms for initiating and structuring mass loss in upper main sequence stars.|Y
HEKJD|UV Spectroscopy of Hot Extreme Helium Stars|John S.|Drilling|Louisiana State|Observing time is requested to obtain low-resolution spectra of four recently-discovered hot extreme helium stars with both the SWP and LWP cameras. These observations will be used to determine the effective temperatures of the stars and to check the results of the fine analysis of high-resolution optical spectra. Our goals are to accurately place these stars in the log(g) Teff diagram and to determine the chemical compositions, not of the original hydrogen-rich envelopes, but of material which has been processed in the nuclear-burning cores of these stars. The IUE spectra will also be used to look for evidence of mass loss in these stars and to check for the presence of even hotter companions.|Y
HELES|IUE Echelle Studies of Physical Processes in Helium-Rich White Dwarfs|Edward M.|Sion|Villanova|We propose to observe the helium-rich, carbon-line white dwarf EG131 in the IUE high dispersion mode. Our target represents the coolest white dwarf ever to be observed with the IUE echelle and first metallic line cool degenerate (either DC, DO. or DZ) to be observed at high resolution. This downward extension in temperature of our echelle studies of helium-rich white dwarfs has the following scientific objectives: (1) to search for evidence of neutral and/or ionized metal absorption features formed in and/or above the photosphere as a test of whether convective dredge-up or interstellar cloud accretion is responsible for trace metals; for example, is the neutral carbon from dredge-up by convection or interstellar accretion (or both)?; other metal ion species undetectable at low IUE resolution would provide the answer; (2) to derive a gravitational redshift (an therefore an accurate mass) for the non-DA white dwarf of this (DQB+dM6) wide binary, the first to be determined for any cool DQ/DB star, all of which have highly uncertain individual masses from spectroscopic (color/model atmosphere) determinations; (3) to derive metal abundances of detected features and use the mix of detected ions to provide a critical test of accretion/diffusion theory in cool helium-rich degenerates and to derive much more stringent (and extensive) upper limit metal/helium ratios in this transitional (DB---->DQ/DZ?) object than is available from the non-visibility of CaII H&K in the optical or from the detected and unexpected C I features discovered in low resolution IUE spectrum. Is accretion an important process in the appearance of DQ spectre? (4)  to use FWHM of detected features to derive upper limits on the rotation rate and magnetic field strength of EG131, the factors thought to be important in preventing the accretion of protons but allowing accretion of metals from --- evaporation.|Y
HELGP|Multiwavelength Observations of Equator-On "Rapid Variable" Be Stars|Geraldine|Peters|University of Southern California|Simultaneous IUE Voyager, and ground-based spectroscopic (Reticon or CCD), photometric, and polarimetric observations at several sites worldwide are proposed for three Be stars to: 1) confirm an apparent correlation between the phase of the l-2 nonradial mode in 28 Cyg and its mass loss rate, 2) look for azimuthal asymmetries in the disk winds of the Be-shell stars zeta Tau and  psi Per similar to those that we recently discovered in epsilon Cap, and 3) further investigate the cause for rapid photometric variability in Be stars. We will look for phase dependent variations in photospheric temperature, luminosity, and mass loss. The observations will allow us to discriminate between two different models offered to explain rapid variability: nonradial pulsations or starspots. To minimize data gaps which in the past have confused interpretation, we suggest 40 continuous hours of IUE observations (detailed above). A limited number of IUE observations of 28 Cyg in 1985 produced the first suggestion of a possible link between nonradial pulsations and mass loss in Be stars, but data gaps, insufficient duration of the observations, and the absence of FUV photometric data precluded confirmation of this important result. Collaborative NASA/ESA IUE observations during the eleventh year, similar to the ones proposed here, revealed striking cyclic variability in the wind of the Be-shell star epsilon Cap on the time scale of the star's rotational period. We wish to ascertain if such behavior is commonplace in Be-shell stars (thought to be Be stars viewed equator-on), and determine whether the asymmetry in the wind is due to nonradial pulsations.|Y
HEOCB|Heavy Elements Abundances in Hot DA White Dwarfs: C, N, Si, and Fe|C. Stuart|Bowyer|UC Berkeley|A survey of the IUE archives by Vennes, Thejll, & Shipman (1991) suggests that IUE should refine two specific areas of its investigation of hot DA white dwarfs: phase dependent study of the binary Feige 24 and definitive measurements of C, N, and Si abundances in a number of strategically important objects. The first problem is currently being addressed by a Year 14th IUE program (WDNSV), and we propose to address the second problem. The presence of heavy elements in two objects (GD 246, GD 2) in which C IV and Si IV spectral lines may have been discovered by IUE near the detection threshold, could be definitely established with the addition of one or two high-dispersion short-wavelength exposures. We demonstrate that the co-addition method considerably improves the detection of weak spectral lines. The presence of heavy elements is potentially linked to the observed, temperature dependent, EUV/soft X-ray flux deficiency in hot DA white dwarfs. We also expose the need to allocate two shifts for the acquisition of short-wavelength high-dispersion exposures of very hot white dwarfs to be discovered in the course of the Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer all-sky survey.|Y
HEPFB|The Physics in Circumstellar Envelopes and Disks Around Herbig Ae/Be Stars|Frederick C.|Bruhweiler|Catholic University|Hillenbrand et al. identify three groups of Herbig Ae/Be stars based on their IR properties, two of which definitely represent early phases of stellar evolution. The extremely young Group II stars have envelopes that have not flattened to disks, while the Group I stars are the more evolved with developed accretion disks. Only two Group II systems, LkH 25 and R Mon, have ever been observed with the IUE at low resolution. Of the more evolved Group 1, only HR 5999, AB Aur, and to some extent HD 163296, have been extensively monitored at high dispersion for UV spectral variability and mass accretion from the disk. Evidence suggests HR 5999 is a close binary. This leaves the IUE dataset for AB Aur as the only reliable dataset that can be used to probe the nature of disk accretion. We need a well-established dataset for other Group I objects to determine if AB Aur represents a typical system. We will observe two extremely young Group II objects, R Mon and RCW 34, the most luminous and possibly the youngest Group II stars known. The star RCW 34 is bright enough to obtain SWP and LWP high dispersion data. We will also monitor at high dispersion two Group I objects, HD 163296,and 200775, each for a period of three days. These observations will determine if rotational modulation exists in the observed mass outflow and infall. Density diagnostics of Fe II and Fe III will be used to probe the CS gas.|Y
HERAH|High Luminosity Helium Pulsational Variables|Albert V.|Holm|CSC - Astronomy Programs|The R CrB-type variables are interesting because the dust they are injecting back into the interstellar medium can be studied quantitatively and because these rare hydrogen-deficient carbon stars may be predecessors to planetary nebulae.  The two brightest R CrB variables, R CrB and RY Sgr, show a semi-regular variability that apparently is the helium star analogue of the Cepheid phenomenon. In both stars the amplitude is small and variable. Typical peak-to-peak amplitudes are 0.15 mag for R CrB and 0.5 mag for RY Sgr. I have studied a rare 0.5 mag fluctuation of R CrB and found that both photospheric temperature changes and variable obscuration by dust were involved. I propose observations for further studies of the pulsational variation of these stars. These data may determine whether dust is generated in every pulsation cycle and provide information on the physical conditions that trigger the formation of dust, in addition to improving our knowledge of the astrophysics of stars with helium atmospheres.|Y
HERJH|High Signal-to-Noise Echelle Spectra of Two He-rich Degenerates|Jay B.|Holberg|U Arizona|We seek new IUE echelle observations of two key He-rich degenerates, RE0503-289 and PG 1159-035. These spectra will be used in combination with existing data to: 1) confirm mass loss in RE0503-289, and 2) coadd the spectra of both stars to determine the photospheric abundance of trace elements. Both stars are unique and important. RE0503-289 is one of the few DO white dwarfs for which EUVE spectra will be obtained and highquality IUE data are necessary for the comparison of abundances in the EUV and UV. The stellar parameters of PG 1159-035 are known with exquisite precision. High quality IUE observations will complete our knowledge of the photospheric composition of this best studied of all pre-white dwarfs.|Y
HERJS|Accretion onto Close Binary Herbig Ae/Be Stars|Jeffrey M. S.|Silvis|Catholic University|Theories of pre-main sequence accretion usually rely on the assumption that the central object is a single star (cf Konigl, 1991). From empirical results and arguments based on simple physical models, we assert that the physics of accretion onto a close binary is profoundly different from accretion onto a single star, Recently several Herbig Ae/Be close binaries have been discovered (cf. Shevchenko et al 1992). These objects display peculiar behavior in the IR and UV. From these signatures, we can predict several systems that are probable close binaries. At this point, the IUE coverage of these systems is minimal.  Our goal is to use the IUE to establish the close binary Herbig Ae/Be stars as a clear subclass of  the Herbig Ae/Be stars, and explore the unique aspects of accretion onto close binary systems.|Y
HETOO|Extragalactic Objects Observed as Too| | | |Abstract unavailable|N
HFOEB|Transition Layers of Hyades F Stars|Erika H.|Bohm-Vitense|U Washington|We would like to observe most Hyades F main sequence stars in order to determine the dependence of transition layer emission on temperature, rotation, binarity and Li abundances. In order to study the dependence on any one parameter one has to keep all other parameters constant. For the Hyades cluster age and metal abundance are constant. The Hyades cluster is the nearest one for which the F stars are bright enough to be observed with IUE in the SWP wavelength region. At the same time there are enough F stars to study the dependence on one parameter with all other parameters being nearly the same.  In the F star region rotation decreases when going from early to late F stars. Simon and Drake suggest that the heating mechanism changes for B-V around 0.45. The chromospheric emission appears not to vary with time for stars earlier than F7 while it is variable for stars later than F8. Michaud suggests depletion of He for early F stars but not for late F stars. Boesgaard and Tripicco find a minimum in the Li abundances for stars with Teff around 6700 K. We want to study the changes (or not) in the transition layer emission related to all these events.|Y
HGHBS|Halo Gas High Galactic Latitude|Blair D.|Savage|Wisconsin|Previous observations toward the north galactic pole (vZ1128 in M3) have shown evidence of infalling "neutral" material at velocities up to 80 km/s. We propose to observe 11 additional stars at high dispersion toward both the north and south galactic poles to determine if this phenomenon is typical or atypical. These data, combined with requested archival data, will provide a complete Survey of the motions of "local" halo gas in directions perpendicular to the plane of the galaxy.|Y
HGIBS|Ultraviolet and Radio Studies of Halo Gas|Blair D.|Savage|Wisconsin|We have initiated a program to intercompare high quality 21 cm emission line data with UV absorption line data for lines of sight through the galactic halo. The 21 cm emission line data are from the NRAO 140 ft telescope and have been corrected for the effects of stray radiation in the antenna side lobes. The UV data are from the IUE Data Archives. The comparison will yield new information on the position of high velocity emitting gas in the galactic halo and allow us to study the high velocity dispersion neutral interstellar gas recently detected in 21 cm emission data by Kulkarni and Fich (1985). This gas has a very low column density but contains most of the kinetic energy of the ISM. It is easily studied in the UV because of the presence of -very strong absorption lines of abundant atoms. The study should provide clues about the relationship between the high velocity clouds and the turbulent interstellar gas in the lower halo. From our study we also hope to identify the best lines of sight for which fol Iow up studies with the high resolution spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope will provide information about abundances and physical conditions in high velocity halo clouds.|Y
HGLBS|Halo Gas Toward Several Distant Stars|Blair D.|Savage|Wisconsin|We propose to obtain high signal-to-noise high-resolution SWP and LWP spectra of two distant halo stars in order to study the properties of galactic halo gas. The stars have been carefully selected by examining the spectra of about 70 objects included in the recent halo gas surveys of Savage and Massa(1987) and Danly (1987). The stars lie at very large distances (estimated to be 5 to 6 kpc) toward the north galactic polar region. The objects are bright enough to permit the acquisition of multiple high dispersion spectra of each star in slightly more than one low radiation shift. The requested data will complement similar halo gas measurements already obtained for the LMC and SMC sight lines and for sight lines to the interior region of the galaxy being obtained in year 11 of the IUE. Some of the scientific goals of the program include: 1. A study aimed at determining the origin of the moderate and highly ionized gas in the galactic halo by carefully intercomparing absorption line profiles for those species expected to be created by photoionization (e.g. Al III and Si IV) with those more likely created by collisional ionization in galactic fountain gas ( e.g. C IV and N V). 2. A study aimed at determining if there arc variations in the high ionization abundance ratios with position in the galaxy halo.|Y
HHCKB|IUE Observations of Herbig-Haro Objects|Karl-Heinz|Bohm|Washington|Observations of the emission line spectra of Herbig-Haro objects in the spectral range 3700A <= lambda <=  11000A have shown that these spectra are formed in the recombination regions of shock waves. Theoretical predictions based on the shock wave theory (which are in satisfactory agreement with spectrophotometric observations in the visual and near infrared part of the spectrum) predict strong emission line radiation in the uv part of the spectrum. We propose to search for this line spectrum with IUE. A detection would be a strong confirmation of the shock wave theory and would lead to a more accurate determination of the shock parameters.|Y

HHEJS|IUE Observations of the Brightest Herbig-Haro Objects|J. Michael|Shull|Colorado|Herbig-Haro (HH) Objects are believed to represent shock-excited condensations expelled from regions of protostellar activity. Observations of the brighter HH-objects show a steeply-rising flux toward short wavelengths, with numerous emission lines suggesting shock velocities of 60-120 km s^-1. We propose to obtain low-resolution IUE spectra of H-H I and H-H 2H to probe the emission line source and to confirm a theoretical prediction that Ho 2-photon emission is responsible for the rising far-UV continuum. A critical test for the 2-photon interpretation lies in searching for the turnover in flux, f(lambda), shortward of 1520 A.  We will compare the UV continua and line strengths with theoretical models of interstellar radiative shocks. Current UV observations are unreliable, because of inadequate exposure time. By combining several IUE exposures with our "stacking" routines, we hope to determine unambiguously the line strengths and fluxes in the far-UV range. We believe these observations are crucial for testing the shock-excitation model and for uncovering correlations of the excitation with proper motions and radial velocities of HH-objects.|Y
HHEKB|IUE Observations of Herbig-Haro & Related Objects|Karl Heinz|Bohm|Washington|Herbig-Haro (H-H) objects are small nebulae which apparently have been ejected from T Tauri stars or their immediate environment. They often show large velocities with respect to these stars. In our earlier I.U.E. observations of H-H 1, H-H 2 and H-H 32A we found that these objects have very strong uv continua and uv emission lines which indicate an unexpectedly high ionization.  We propose low resolution I.U.E. observations of the Herbig-Haro objects H-H 2H, HH 24A, H-H 32A and H-H 40. The purpose of this study is an identification of the origin of the strong uv continuum. We shall especially attempt to see whether one of the two (or both) mechanisms suggested so far, namely dust scattering of a stellar continuum or "in situ" two photon emission in a shock wave is compatible with the observations. We also would like to see how the ionization indicated by the uv emission lines changes from object to object and how the shock wave theory may have to be modified in order to incorporate the results.  After we have determined in a very preliminary way that the immediate environment of the Cohen-Schwartz star (which is apparently the "energy source" of H-H 1 and HH 2) emits a continuum similar to that of a H-H object we would like to extend these observations to the long wavelength range and observe the star AS 353A in a similar manner.|Y
HHERS|UV Observations of Low Excitation HH Objects.|Richard D.|Schwartz|Missouri|Optical observations of the blue-UV continua of HH objects in combination with shock wave computations suggest that an enhanced twophoton (2q) emission process is responsible for the continua. The observations and shock wave models indicate that the lower excitation objects possess the greater 2q enhancements. It is thus proposed that the low excitation, low interstellar extinction objects HH 43 and HII 47 be observed to measure the UV continuum. In particular, the 1450 A turnover in the energy distribution predicted by the 2q hypothesis is to be sought.|Y
HHFJS|IUE Observations of Herbig-Haro Objects|J. Michael|Shull|Colorado - JILA|We propose to observe the brightest Herbig-Haro objects, HH-1 and HH-2, and the fainter HH-24A in low dispersion with IUE for four scientific purposes: (1) to accurately determine the far-UV continuum and emission line strengths; (2) -to study possible line-to-continuum variations; (3) to investigate the continuum characteristics of HH-24A (which may include both H  two-photon and reflection components); and (4) to attempt a novel investigation of anaomalous grain characteristics in these star-forming regions. This research is an extension of our successful 5th year IUE program in which we confirmed for the first time the Ho two-photon nature of the UV continuum of HH-2H.|Y
HHFRS|Ultraviolet Observations of Low Excitation Herbig-Haro Objects|Richard D.|Schwartz|Missouri|Optical observations of the blue-UV continua in HH objects in combination with shock wave calculations suggest that an enhanced twophoton (2q) emission process is responsible for the continua. Recent observations of HH 2H, HH 43, and HH 47 with the I.U.E. have revealed a hint of a turnover in the continuum near 1500 A predicted by the 2q hypothesis. In addition, the low-excitation objects (HH 43 and 47) exhibit fluorescent emission lines of H2 in the SW region. Observations are proposed to improve the signal to noise level in the SW range for FIR 43. Confirmation of the 1500 A turnover is sought, and possible variations in the H2 emission lines will be studied. To complete observations of the UV continuum, an exposure of HH 43 in the LW range (1900 - 3000 A) is proposed.|Y
HHGJS|IUE Observations of Herbig-Haro Objects|J. Michael|Shull|Colorado-Lasp|We propose to observe the Herbig-Haro Objects, HH-1, HH-24A, HH-43 in low dispersion with IUE for four scientific purposes: (1) to accurately determine the far-UV continuum and emission line strengths; (2) to study possible lineto-continuum variations; (3) to investigate the continuum characteristics of HH-24A (which may include both H two-photon and reflection components); and (4) to investigate anomalous grain characteristics in these star-forming regions. This research is an extension of our 5th and 6th year IUE programs in which we confirmed the H two-photon nature of the UV continuum and discovered anomalously low UV extinction in HH-2H.|Y
HHGKB|Formation of UV Continua and Faint Lines in Herbig-Haro Objects|Karl-Heinz|Bohm|Washington|We propose to obtain one two-shift exposure (14-15 hour) of each of the Herbig-Haro (H-H) objects H-H1 and H-H2. This will be done jointly with Drs. Reinhard Mundt and Josef Solf of the Max-Planck-Institut for Astronomie, who are submitting the corresponding proposal to E.S.A.  It is the primary purpose of this study to determine the energy distribution in the unexpectedly strong continuum of H-H objects with higher accuracy and reliability than was possible from the relatively short (and underexposed) observations available now. The results will be used for a critical test of the hypothesis that the continuum is collisionally enhanced two-photon radiation of hydrogen. Especially, the investigation of the wavelength interval 1216A <~ x <~ 1410A, in which the theory predicts a very steep drop of the intensity towards shorter wavelengths will be very useful in this respect. The possibility that other (emission or absorption) mechanisms contribute to the shape of the continuum will also be investigated.  We plan to determine the possible contribution of the Orion reflection nebulosity (ORN) to the observed H-H spectrum by also studying the spectrum in the parts of the aperture not covered by the H-H object. The H-H spectrum will be corrected for this ORN contribution. We shall also identify and measure fainter emission lines so that the elimination of the faint emission line contribution from the apparent continuum can be done as accurately as possible.  As a byproduct, this study will give us useful information about the physical conditions in H-H objects by adding to the available information on their emission lines. We hope that this will help us to contribute to the further clarification of the apparent contradiction between the ionization determined from optical lines and that indicated by the ultraviolet lines.|Y
HHGRS|Low-Excitation Herbig-Haro Objects and Interstellar Extinction|Richard D.|Schwartz|Missouri|The UV continuum in Herbig-Haro (HH) objects bears the signature of HI two-photon (2q) emission as determined with recent IUE observations. Since the spectral energy distribution of the 2q emission is known theoretically observations of reddened HR objects are proposed in which the measured UV contiuum would be used in combination with the theoretical distribution to obtain the UV extinction curve. Existing evidence for low UV extinction toward HII objects measured to date is discussed. First-time observations of HH 11 and additional observations of HH 43 are proposed. In the latter case, in addition to extinction measurements, confirmation of absorption features seen in an earlier SWP spectrum is sought, along with an analysis of possible variability in Lyman band H2 fluorescent emission-lines. The data will be analyzed in conjunction with a shock wave modeling code.|Y
HHGTS|IUE Observations of Flows and Jets in HH Objects|Theodore|Simon|Hawaii|The Herbig-Haro object HH-12 in NGC 1333 appears to be connected" to a nearby, visible T Tauri star by a narrow, sinuous streamer or "jet" of ionized material. A "counter jet" is also observed to emanate from the T Tau star. The plasma in the jet has a characteristic radial velocity of -100 km/s. while that in the counter jet has a velocity of +80 km/s. Hence, the T Tau star associated with HH-12 is apparently the source of a highly collimated, bipolar, supersonic flow, which at one terminus excites HH-12. We wish in this proposal to carry out IUE observations of the sinous jet in order to 1) look for evidence of shock-excited emission characteristic of 10**5 K gas (expected on the basis of an outflow velocity of 100 km/s), and 2) determine whether the narrow jet and counter jet features are cooling instabilities within a spatially more extended flow or intrinsically narrow features indicating an extraordinary degree of collimation. We propose also to observe a similar optical (and radio) jet emanating from the T Tau star that excites HH-28,-29, and -102. The morphology of these steady flows appears to differ from that associated with HH-1 and HH-2, which may represent "interstellar bullets."|Y
HHHJS|IUE Observations of Herbig-Haro Objects|J. Michael|Shull|Colorado-Lasp|We propose to obtain low-resolution SWP and LWP spectra of the Herbig-Haro objects HH-24A, HH-43, and HH-7 and to continue the SWP monitoring of the bright HH-1 and HH-2H for variability. Herbig-Haro objects appear to be shockexcited nebulae associated with partially neutral clumps of matter ejected from star-forming regions. Their UV spectra exhibit a prominent H I 2-photon continuum and (often) strong UV emission lines of C III], C IV, 0 II], C II], etc. Our scientific objectives are: (1) to investigate the mechanism of UV continuum and line formation; (2) to diagnose properties of the shock (density, velocity, heavy element abundances); (3) to study the UV selective extinction and grain properties (deredden the H I twophoton continuum). After our previous years' studies of HH-1 and HH-2H, we are pursuing HH-24A (which has possible reflection components), HH-43 (anomalous line emission and possible H2 fluorescent emission), and HH-7 (a "low-excitation" object which probably has a strong 2-photon continuum). The shock-wave analysis will be performed with our radiative shock code, developed over several years.|Y
HHHKB|Ultraviolet Study of the Unusual Hergib-Haro Objects H-H 24 and H-H 32|Karl-Heinz|Bohm|Washington|We propose to obtain one two-shift SWP exposure of each of the two unusual but rather faint Herbig-Haro (H-H) objects H-H 24 and H-H 32. It should be possible to answer some fundamental questions concerning 11-H objects with the help of these observations.  H-H 24 is the best example of an H-H object in which (because of the high measured linear polarization) the continuum is assumed to be due to dust scattering of light from a (relatively nearby) T Tauri star. This situation differs from that in many other H-H objects in which the continuum is usually assumed to be due to collisionally enhanced two-photon emission. If this distinction is correct we must expect that especially in the ultraviolet the energy distribution of the continuum in H-H 24A should differ considerably from that in other H-H objects. We propose that this important prediction be checked.  H-H 32 has an especially complex velocity field (indicated by a very large range of velocities reaching very high values). We propose to investigate whether this leads to unusually strong shocks and correspondingly to an UV emission line spectrum which differs from that of other H-H objects.|Y
HHIJR|Bright Knots in HH-1 and HH-2|John C.|Raymond|CFA|We have constructed bow shock models which are generally successful in explaining the ultraviolet and optical emission lines in Herbig-Haro objects 1 and 2. Recently Brugel et al. examined IUE spectra of HH-1 and reported that the UV flux varied substantially over two years, while the optical fluxes remained unaltered. If the UV variation is real, it is difficult to reconcile with our models. An alternative hypothesis is that HH-1F, the knot which we expect to be brightest in the UV because of its intense [O III] emission and low reddening, was near the edge of the Large Aperture during nearly all of the exposures, and that small differences in blind offset position and Large Aperture position angle account for the apparent UV variability. We wish to test this hypothesis by observing HH-1F. Our models predict emission line profiles in fair agreement with observations of most of the knots in the HH-1 - HH-2 complex. However, the knot HH2A has a very asymmetric profile that is not consistent with our models. We think this discrepancy is related to the fact that this knot recently appeared and may be rapidly evolving. A good UV spectrum of this very bright knot would help us constrain improved models and should have archival value.|Y
HHJKB|H2 Continua in Ultraviolet Spectra of Herbig-Haro Objects|Karl-Heinz|Bohm|Washington|Our recent two-shift exposures of the Herbig-Haro (HH) objects HH 1 and HH 2 have shown that the fluorescent H2 continuum originally described by Dalgarno. Herzberg and Stephens is detectable in these objects. It appears to determine the details of the continuum structure for 1400A ~< lambda ~< 1700A as well as the position of the continuum maximum near 1580 A in these objects. These facts are important. since the continuum is an indication of dissociation of H2. Since both HH I and HH 2 are "high excitation HH objects". it is important to find out whether the H2 continuum is also present in low excitation HH objects (continuum radiation below 1100 A is necessary for the formation of this fluorescent continuum). For this purpose we propose two-shift (~ 15 hour) exposures of SWP spectra of the low excitation objects HH 43 and HH 47. Using our experience from HH 2 we expect that these spectra should permit us to determine whether the fluorescent H2 continuum is present and how important it is relative to the two-photon continuum of hydrogen (which is a very important mechanism of continuum formation in HH objects). We also propose to obtain a two-shift LWP spectrum of HH 43 in order to determine the detailed structure of the continuum at longer wavelengths.The spectra will also be used to obtain (necessarily limited) information about the spatial distribution of continuum and line emission in the objects.|Y
HHKEB|New and Unique HH-Objects 80 and 81: High Excatation is Shocks|Edward W.|Brugel|Colorado - CASA|We propose to obtain low-resolution SWP and LWP spectra of two recently discovered, unusually high excitation Herbig-Haro (HH) condensations - HH-80 and HH-81. In general Herbig-Haro objects are recognized as shock-excited nebulae associated with partially neutral clumps, or jets of matter, ejected from star-forming regions. It must be emphasized that HH-80 and HH-81 are truly unique within this class. Both of these newly discovered objects are "extremely" bright and together with HH-1/2 belong among the brightest HH-objects known. Besides being bright, they also show unusually strong high excitation optical lines and are apparently driven by tile most luminous energy source associated with any HH-object.  The ultraviolet spectra emanating from the shock excited gas within HH-objects exhibit a prominent "blue" continuum, interpreted as enhanced H I two-photon and/or fluorescent H2 continuum emission, and (often) strong uv emission lines of C III], C IV, C III, and Mg H. Previously observed high excitation HH objects with moderate shock velocities (v. ~ 70-100 km s^-1) (e.g. HH-2) show relatively strong C III] and C IV emission; while the low excitation objects with correspondingly low shock velocities (v(s) < 40 km s^-1) (e.g. HH-43) contain only weak H2 molecular lines and no high excitation emission. (These shock velocities refer to a plane parallel shock model.) From their observed optical excitation level, it is inferred that HH-80 and HH-81 have relatively large shock velocities and very high excitation, thus a strong uv emission line spectra is predicted. Using existing shock models, the strength of the uv lines (C II], C III] and C IV) and the uv continuum can be used as diagnostics for ascertaining the actual shock velocity, ambient density pre-shock ionization fraction and bow shock shape. Furthermore, HH objects derive their energy from the wind emanating from a young stellar object. Thus, the total observed radiated emission at all wavelengths is directly proportional to the input kinetic energy from the wind. It is therefore possible, based upon a knowledge of the total energy emitted, to estimate the required mass loss rate for the 6000 L(sun) early type star which is apparently driving HH-80 and HH-81. IUE data are essential for determining the total emitted energy since a significant fraction of the emission is in the UV. In summary, these proposed IUE observations of two totally unusual objects will be used to investigate previously unexplored conditions within high excitation shock regions.|Y
HHKKB|H2 Emission in Low To Moderate Excitation Herbig-Haro Objects|Karl-Heinz|Bohm|Washington|High and low excitation Herbig-Haro objects differ drastically irk their IUE spectra in the SWP range. While high excitation objects show strong CIV and CIII] lines, low excitation objects show fluorescent H2 lines. No intermediate spectra are known. The continuum shows a complex wavelength structure in which in both cases (i.e., for high and low excitation objects) a contribution from a fluorescent H2 continuum seems to be present.  We propose to obtain two-shift exposures of low resolution SWP spectra of the very low excitation object HH47 and of the moderate excitation Herbig-Haro object (and the adjoining "jet') near DG Tauri. We want LO study specifically the energy distribution in the continuum and the spatial distribution of the H, line and continuum emission. (We shall use procedures similar to those which have been used earlier in studies of high excitation HH objects.) The results will give us information about the presence of H2 molecules close to the shock waves of HH objects and about the destruction of these molecules by the precursor radiation of the shocks. The study of the ultraviolet H2 emission is important because it leads to additional constraints for shock wave models of Herbig-Haro objects.|Y
HHLEB|High Velocity Interstellar Shocks: Herbig-Haro Objects in Cepheus A, and HH-34|Edward W.|Brugel|Colorado - CASA|Herbig-Haro objects are recognized as shock-excited nebulae associated with partially neutral clumps, or jets of matter, ejected from star-forming regions. The ultraviolet spectra emanating from the excited gas exhibit a prominent continuum, interpreted as enhanced H I two-photon and/or fluorescent H2 continuum emission, and (often) strong UV emission lines of C III], C IV, C II], and Mg II Previous IUE observations of these objects have been restricted to either extremely low shock velocity objects (v, < 40 km s^-1) or objects with moderate shock velocities (v(s) ~70-100 km s^-1). (These velocities refer to the mean velocity for a plane parallel shock model.) We propose to obtain low-resolution SWP and LWP spectra of two high shock velocity Herbig-Haro condensations. One located near the star formation region Cepheus A, (GGD-37 'S', 'H'), the other, HH34, located in Orion. These objects were chosen based upon their extremely large H-alpha line widths (300 - 380 km s^-1), and correspondingly assumed high shock velocities. Previously observed high excitation HH objects (e.g. HH-1, HH-2) show relatively strong C III] and C IV emission; while low excitation objects (e.g. HH-43, HH-47) contain only weak H2 molecular lines and no high excitation emission. The observed excitation level has also been interpreted as an indication of the relative shock velocity. Since the HH-objects in Cepheus A, and HH-34, have the largest known optical line widths and a relatively large [OIII]/H-beta ratio, it is inferred that these objects have large shock velocities. If the line widths are truly indicative of large shock velocities, then a relatively strong UV emission line spectra is predicted. Using existing shock models, the strength of the UV lines (C II], C III] and C IV) and UV continuum can be used as diagnostics for ascertaining the actual shock velocity, ambient density preshock ionization fraction and bow shock shape. It may also be possible to prove that grain destruction by the shock has produced an anomalous UV extinction in these objects.  Furthermore, HH objects derive their energy from the wind emanating from a young stellar object. The total observed radiated emission at all wavelengths is directly proportional to the input kinetic energy from the wind. Thus, it is possible to estimate the required mass loss rate based upon a knowledge of the total energy emitted. IUE data are necessary since a significant fraction of the emission is in the UV.|Y
HHLFY|A Unique Herbig Hard Object|Farhad|Yusef-Zadeh|Northwestern|We propose to obtain low-resolution SWP and LWP spectra of a Herbig Haro, object with unique properties. This object, known as the "streamer", is located several arc-minutes to the north of HH34 in Orion and exhibits a remarkably long and narrow structure, unlike the morphology of any other HH object, with dimensions of 5'x10" in optical photographs. The optical data indicates a moderately high excitation with no scattered light and near-IR observation shows a 17th magnitude object at the core of the streamer. Radio continuum observations of the core of the streamer using the VLA in a number of configurations confirm and establish significant Polarized emission (7%) at 6cm. This result suggests that the source producing the streamer is a nonthermal-emitting radio source. Because of the presence of a number of newly born low-mass stars near HH34 in the Orion nebula, it is likely that the source at the core of the streamer is a low-mass star and is responsible for the non-thermal emission and the HH nebulosity. We hypothesize that the relativistic particles, possibly accelerated by embedded shocks, stream through the neutral medium, and ionize the gas completely via collisional ionization. We expect that much of the cooling occurs at gas temperatures with spectral signatures in the vacuum ultraviolet. We believe that the target of the proposed observation is unique in its characteristics and deserves to be examined in detail by the IUE in order to determine the relevant mechanisms involved in producing HH objects in star forming regions.|Y
HHLKB|Ultraviolet Continuum Emission in the Peculiar Herbig-Haro Object 24A|Karl-Heinz|Bohm|Washington|The peculiar Herbig-Haro Object HH24A shows high linear polarization in its optical continuum. This is normally assumed to indicate that we are seeing a dust scattered stellar continuum. Surprisingly very preliminary (underexposed) SWP- and LWP-I.U.E. spectra, seem to show a spectral energy distribution and a wavelength-dependent spatial emission distribution which have been considered as typical of the continuous emission of "normal" Herbig-Haro objects (which is formed "in situ" and is due to two-photon emission and, probably, a fluorescent H2 continuum). So, if we accept the preliminary I.U.E. spectrophotometry as real then there seems to be an apparent contradiction between conclusions from polarimetric and spectrophotometric data which would force us to revise drastically the interpretation of continuum emission.  In order to contribute to the clarification of this problem we would like to obtain improved spatially resolved spectrophotometric data on the ultraviolet continuum and interpret them. We propose to obtain (in collaboration with Josef Solf, MPI f. Astronomie, Heidelberg) two shift exposures of HH24A in both the SWP and LWP ranges in order to obtain reasonably reliable data on the spatial distribution of the continuous emission and on its spectral distribution. In the derivation of the spatial emission distribution the point spread function of I.U.E. and the variation of the sensitivity along the large aperture will be taken into account.  We shall investigate whether the continuum is really indistinguishable from the continuum of "normal" HH objects, or whether it is compatible with a dust scattered stellar continuum, or whether a new interpretation is needed.|Y
HHMKB|Variability and Shock Instabilities in Herbig-Haro Objects|Karl-Heinz|Bohm|Washington|The high excitation Herbig-Haro (HH) object HH1 has been found earlier to be variable in the CIV 1550 and C III] 1909 emission lines (Brugel, Bohm, Shull and Bohm-Vitense 1985). Recently theoretical studies of time-dependent radiating bow shocks (which model certain HH objects including HH1) have shown that some instabilities can grow with a time scale of 10-20 years. It would therefore be very useful to obtain time sequences of SWP spectra of HH objects of 10 years or more. These may help us to decide whether the observed variability is related to the theoretically predicted instability of bow shocks.  In the case of HH1 there are 6 SWP spectra available which cover the time interval from 1979 until January 1986. For HH2 the situation is similar. We propose to obtain during the next observing year one SWP spectrum of each HHI and HH2. These observations should be two-shift exposures in order to achieve good spectrophotometric accuracy. This would give us a time sequence of spectra from 1979 to 1990 for HH1 and from 1980 to 1990 for HH2 admittedly with a gap between 1986 and 1990), making the time interval almost comparable to the growth times of instabilities in typical bow shocks.|Y
HHNKB|The Physical Structure of the Complex Herbig-Haro Object HH2|Karl-Heinz|Bohm|U Washington|The Herbig-Haro, objects HH1 and HH2 are shock-excited regions which have formed at the two "working surfaces" of the bipolar jets from a young stellar object ("VLA1"). Although they are positioned symmetrically with respect to the VLA1 they show completely different morphologies and physical structure. While a large range of ultraviolet and optical observations of HH1 can be interpreted in terms of a bow shock model, HH2 looks chaotic and no convincing explanation is yet available.  We propose to contribute to the solution of this problem by carrying out a spatially resolved SWP spectroscopy of HH2 covering a considerably larger surface area than earlier UV spectroscopy (which was all restricted to the same region). Our approach is based on the fact that the SWP spectra are very sensitive to the "excitation" (i.e., the local shock velocity) going from almost pure (fluorescent) H2 emission at a shock velocity V. of <~ 40 kms^-1 to strong CIV, SiIV and CIII] emission lines at V2 >~ 90 kms^1.  Line-by-Iine analysis of 3 spectra centered on the condensations HH2A, HH2G and HH2L will give us useful information about the spatial distribution of important line intensities "excitation' and local shock velocities for a large part of the object. This should lead to a more convincing description of the physical structure of HH2. We shall also compare the intensity distributions of lines with our predictions for bow shock models in order to see whether HH2 possibly consists of several bow shocks.|Y
HHOFY|Observations of Bright HH Objects in M42|Farhad|Yusef-Zadeh|Northwestern University|We propose to obtain low-resolution SWP and LWP spectra of the brightest of a family of Herbig Haro objects in M42, namely knots A, B, and C, which remain unobserved by IUE, except for a test exposure obtained on knot B. M42/HH3-4 (knots A & B) which are projected south of the optical "bar" in the Orion nebula form a complex extended structure with dimensions of 45" x30" surrounding theta^2 Ori A. The wellobserved M42/HH1-2 lie close to and northwest of the center of M42 near the BN IR source. The luminous cluster of HH objects shows radial velocities ranging between -280 km/s and -9 km/s with respect to the Orion nebula in [SII] and [FeII] line emission. Recent radio continuum observations of knots A, B, and C indicate that their individual components are 200-500 times more luminous than the emission from prominent HH1 and HH2, as detected previously in the radio wavelengths. We expect that their unusual brightness is the result of a strong shock wave powered by the neighboring massive stars, in particular by Theta^2 Ori A in the case of M42/HH3-4. We intend to determine the relevant emission mechanisms involved in HH objects associated with massive star forming regions and to compare their uv emission with those of classical high and low excitation HH objects associated with low luminosity, low-mass stars.|Y

HLEPM|Super W-R Stars in M33|Philip|Massey|United Kingdom|We propose to make long exposures (~ 3 - 7.5 hr.) of several of the superluminous Wolf-Rayet stars discovered in the giant HII regions of M33 by Conti and Massey (1981 Ap.J. in press). These stars show WN spectra but are far too luminous (Mv ~-8 to -9) to be normal, single W-R stars. Are these objects small clusters containing one or more normal W-R stars? Or are they instead single, supermassive objects, such as suggested to be the case for R136a, the 3000 M(sun) W-R star found in 30 Dor by Casinelli et al. (1981)? IUE observations should be able to answer this question.|Y
HLESS|Luminous, Extended Atmosphere Stars in the Local Group|Steven N.|Shore|Case Western Reserve|This proposal is intended to complete the survey begun in the fourth year of IUE, of the extended atmosphere stars of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. This project resulted in the discovery of spectrum variability of S 96 on a timescale of months, and an SMC analog (S 65). The purpose of this project is threefold: to study the stability of envelopes of the most luminous stars in the Local Group, to study possible metallicity effects connected with the ejection of massive stellar winds from luminous stars, and to provide an accurate temperature sequence for stars observed optically in a homogeneous fashion. In order to complete the last of these aims, we require observation of 7 stars which were not covered in the fourth year. In order to complete the first two goals, 4 stars will need to be observed again, and one of the Hubble-Sandage variables in M31 will also be observed. This should extend the range, using archival data as well, of the metallicity survey over the widest possible contrast.|Y

HMLDL|Ultraviolet Spectral Energy Distributions of Mercury-Manganese Stars|David S.|Leckrone|NASA/GSFC|We propose to obtain low dispersion trailed SWP and LWP exposures of those stars included in Leckrone's Guaranteed Time Observer program on the Hubble Space Telescope for which such images have not been obtained previously. These data will be used to derive spectral energy distributions of specific Mercury-Manganese stars which are essential to fitting model atmospheres as part of a program to establish fundamental elemental abundances. Our approach has been to combine high quality, composited IUE data with high signal-to-noise optical region spectra in detailed fully self-consistent abundance analyses. HST observations with the High Resolution Spectrograph will continue this program both by extending it to higher resolution and higher signal-to-noise and to additional stars.  Low dispersion IUE data will be used with optical region spectrophotometry (and/or high quality Stromgren colors) and Balmer line profiles to determine the effective temperatures and surface gravities essential to defining an accurate model atmosphere for each program star. This is critical for high quality elemental abundance analyses. The UV flux distributions are also of interest in their own right. We want to compare those of the HgMn stars with non-solar photospheric compositions to those of the appropriate normal stars to study the effects of the non-solar abundances. This comparison will provide an important test of the completeness of the opacity distributions of the new gf values now being computed by Kurucz. Further we plan to determine Bolometric luminosities and corrections.|Y

HROES|IUE High Resolution Study of a Newly Discovered PG1159 Star|Edward M.|Sion|Villanova University|We propose to obtain a high dispersion SWP echelle image of the newly discovered, extremely hot, non-DA degenerate RE0503289, discovered during the ROSAT EUV all-sky survey and subsequently identified as a D01 white dwarf during optical followup observations. This object appears to be a member of the PG1159 class, the hottest known white dwarfs with temperatures close to 150,000K, atmospheres composed mainly of carbon and oxygen, and representing an evolutionary phase between the WolfRayet central stars of planetary nebulae and the DO white dwarfs. Only one other member of the main (Log g >= 7) PG1159 group has been observed at IUE high resolution, PG1159-035 itself. RE0503-289 is a factor of two brighter in the far UV than PG1159-035 and, therefore, represents a unique opportunity to obtain a good signal-to-noise high resolution SWP spectrum of a high gravity (Log g >= 7) PG 1159 star. Our scientific objectives are: (1) search for evidence of ongoing mass loss as either detached (velocity-displaced) absorption, P Cygni structure or broad emission; (2) detect high ionization metallic C, N, 0, Si, and Fe transitions (undetectable at low IUE resolution) from which critically needed chemical abundances will be extracted using fully NLTE model atmospheres; (3) Use the extreme temperature dependence 0 V 1371 in a PG1159 atmosphere to secure an accurate temperature and the N V (1238, 1242) to uniquely determine a nitrogen abundance; (4) compare the line strengths, mix (variety) of ions and abundances of RE0503-289 with the IUE echelle results for PG 1159-035 and the generically related but lower gravity (Log g = 6) planetary nuclei NGC246 and K1-16.|Y
HROMP|The Carbon Abundance in the Galactic H II Region M17|Manuel|Peimbert|UNAM - Mexico|It is paramount to derive the C abundance in M17 for three different reasons: a) to produce an ionization and temperature structure model of M17 that will permit to derive accurate abundances of the most abundant elements (CNO), b) to determine the C/H abundance gradient in the Galaxy (particularly the C/O abundance gradient), and c) to study if the conversion factor from CO to H2 is a function of galactocentric distance.  We have available optical imagery and spectroscopy that cover the M17 H II region, (Hester et al. 1992, Peimbert et al. 1992). We can thus determine very accurately the reddening, physical conditions (Ne and Te) and spatial ionization structure of M17.  We have selected from these data the brightest regions in M17 with UV emission lines observable with IUE, and we propose to obtain multiple and deep low dispersion SWP and LWP exposures of them.|Y

HSBJL|Ultraviolet Spectroscopy of OBN-OBC Stars|John B.|Lester|Toronto|We have in progress a systematic program to study the atmospheric properties and abundances of the OBN-OBC stars. Of the known OBN-OBC stars, 752 have now been observed at high dispersion at either the Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory or at the David Dunlap Observatory. We are requesting observing time on the I.U.E. satellite to extend our spectral coverage into the ultraviolet in order to make the following advances: (a) To improve our knowledge of the carbon and nitrogen abundances of these stars by using the intrinsically strong ultraviolet lines from low excited levels. (b) To study the extent to which mass motions in the atmospheres of these stars might be connected to the spectral peculiarity.|Y
HSBPC|The Relationship Among O, OF and WR Stars|Peter S.|Conti|Colorado|High and low resolution spectra of 0, Of and WR stars in the galaxy, LMC and SMC will be obtained. The overall intent is to study in a systematic fashion the stellar winds and mass loss rates in these stars and the likely evolutionary connection between them. This U.V. work is complementary to ground based spectroscopy being undertaken by the Principal Investigator and will be closely coordinated with theoretical work by several colleagues in Boulder.|Y
HSCAD|UV and X-Ray Observations of OB Supergiants|Andrea K.|Dupree|CFA|We propose to obtain simultaneous ultraviolet P-Cygni line profiles and Xray fluxes in order to study the coronae of the OB supergiants Epsilon Ori Kappa Ori. Timescales of coronal variation will yield information on the volume and distribution of hot gas. Variations in N V should be produced from coronal variation by Auger ionization, while C IV and Si IV should be much less sensitive; in this way we hope to separate variations in the wind due to coronal effects from changes caused by other mechanisms, such as the radiatively- driven instability. The simultaneous X-ray measurements will enable us to test for a direct relation between ionizing flux and line optical depth. This would not occur for example, with the suggestion of deJager, Lamers, Macchetto, & Snow (1979) that the variations in 0 winds may be due to photometric variations in the stellar EUV continuua.|Y
HSCAU|The Effective Temperatures of Stars of Types 03, 04, and 05|Anne B.|Underhill|NASA/GSFC|If the positions of the early O-type stars in the HR diagram are to be accurately determined, it is essential that the effective temperatures of these stars be accurately evaluated. The precise positions of these stars raise interesting questions concerning the masses of Population I O stars and their evolution. Present information an where the early O stars lie in the HR diagram is conflicting.  It is proposed to measure absolute ultraviolet fluxes between 1200 and 3200A for about 25 stars of types O3, O4 and O5 using the lowdispersion spectrographs of IUE with the large aperture. The target stars have V magnitudes in the range 5.97 to 10.52. The measured absolute fluxes would be used with absolute fluxes in the range 3300 to 10,000 A, determined by means of broad-band photometry and/or scanner observations, to find angular diameters and the integrated fluxes of the program stars. From this information effective temperatures will be found. Some broad-band photometry exists for the program stars; the remainder which is necessary can be obtained using ground-based equipment now operative.|Y
HSCBW|IUE Measurements of Hot Stars Near the Ecliptic Plane, etc|B. E.|Woodgate|NASA/GSFC|We propose to use the absolute photometric calibration system established for IUE as a reference for in-flight calibration of the Ultraviolet Spectrometer and Polarimeter (UVSP) on the Solar Maximum Mission. The UVSP has telescope and spectrometer optics which may degrade in reflectivity on exposure to the Solar UV radiation which it is its objective to observe. By observing stars of known brightness this degradation can be measured and the data corrected. This is important for calculating emission measures, and for densities using line intensity ratios. The UVSP will observe bright UV stars which come within 0.65 0 of the Sun once per year as each passes by the Sun, and count rates measured for 2 to 3 A pieces of continuum at several places in the 1200--l700A region. We propose to observe the same stars with IUE when they are sufficiently far from the Sun, and measure their intensities several times to check for variability.  The UVSP will also measure the linear and circular continuum polarization of the brighter near ecliptic stars and interpret this data together with the spectra obtained by IUE.|Y
HSCJD|Ultraviolet Spectroscopy of OB+ Stars|John S.|Drilling|Louisiana State|Observing time is requested to obtain ultraviolet spectra for 12 OB+ stars which have recently been found to be of high astrophysical interest. Included are eight extreme helium stars, two hot subdwarfs, a DO white dwarf and a dwarf nova.|Y
HSCLC|Comparative UV Spectrophotometry of High and Low Velocity O-Type Stars|L.|Carrasco|Mexico|We have suggested that the high velocity OB stars (runaways) are Old Disk Population members, disk counterparts of the hot UVbright stars in globular clusters. This hypothesis has been tested only on kinematical grounds. Their visible spectra are apparently very similar to those of extreme Population I OB stars. We propose a comparative ultraviolet spectrophotometric study of good candidates to membership of the two different populations. The high dispersion mode in I.U.E. -is appropriate for our purposes. We expect to find differences between the two groups mainly in: a) Atmospheric chemical abundances, b) spectral energy distributions and, c) stellar winds. We also speculate that the hot, Old Disk Population stars may be surrounded by cool, expanding circumstellar envelopes.|Y
HSCPC|The Relationship Among O, OF, and WR Stars|Peter S.|Conti|Colorado - JILA|High and low resolution spectra of 0, Of and WR stars in the galaxy, LMC and SMC will be obtained. The overall intent is to study in a systematic fashion the stellar winds and mass loss rates in these stars and the likely evolutionary connection between them. A comparison among these objects in the three stellar systems will also be undertaken. This U.V. work is complementary to ground based spectroscopy by the Principal Investigator and will be closely coordinated with theoretical work with several colleagues in Boulder.|Y
HSCSP|Abundance Effects on Mass Loss in O and Early B Type Stars|Sidney B.|Parsons|Texas|It is proposed that the effects of the considerable difference in chemical abundance between the SMC (metal poor) and the LMC (more nearly solar neighborhood abundances) an mass-loss mechanisms in 0 and early B type stars be determined through IUE observations of such stars in the SMC, LMC, and Milky Way. Stars in the Milky Way are known to exhibit onset of significant mass loss at a characteristic M(bol). Observations of mass-loss on-set vs M(bol) for stars in the SW and DE will be used to study the nature of the dependence of the mass-loss mechanism on chemical abundance.. It is proposed that C IV (1550), N V (1240), Si IV (1394, 1403) and other lines be observed in 15 stars in the SMC, 8 stars in the LMC not previously observed, and several stars in Galactic associations, using the short wavelength low dispersion camera of the IUE. The results should establish the extent to which radiationpressure driven mass loss is influenced by atmospheric opacity effects due to heavy elements.|Y

HSEPH|Evolution of Mass Loss in Stars of Magellanic Cloud Clusters|Paul W.|Hodge|Washington|We propose to continue our study of the brightest main sequence and supergiant stars in two rich clusters, NGC 330 and NGC 2100, in the Magellanic Clouds. These very young globular-like clusters have several supergiants that must have essentially the same age and mass as the brightest main sequence stars. They therefore offer the possibility to follow the evolution of mass loss during supergiant evolution for essentially identical stars, giving information about the final mass of massive stars in the MCs during the later stages of stellar evolution. This, of course, determines the central temperature in their final stages of element synthesis. The MCs, with their somewhat lower metals abundance, can provide us with information about how this process occurs for stars that are chemically quite different from those in the solar neighborhood.|Y
HSETS|UV & X-Ray Variability in Hot Stars|Theodore P.|Snow|Colorado|This is a proposal for Director's Discretionary time to obtain simultaneous ultraviolet and x-ray observations of hot stars with variable winds, including particularly O stars, a few early 8 objects and an assortment of Wolf-Rayet stars. The x-ray data are to be obtained with the EXOSAT satellite, scheduled for launch during the latter portion of the fifth year of IUE operations. Similar proposals are being submitted for EXOSAT time (by C. de Loore) and for Vilspa IUE shifts (by C. de Loore and A.J. Willis). The principal goals of the proposed study are to establish the incidence and timescale of both x-ray and UV variability in these objects, and to relate the observed variations to the driving mechanism and the structure of their winds. The simultaneous observations potentially can reveal the location of the x-ray-emitting region, the nature of the ionization, the cause of the fluctuations, and in the process, may shed light on the fundamental basis of the winds from these stars.|Y
HSFBM|The Nature of the UV Excess Objects with Missing H-Alpha|Bruce|Margon|Washington|During a photographic/spectroscopic survey of the plane of the Milky Way for faint UV-excess objects, we have discovered a subset of six 15-16th magnitude stars which defy easy classification. They are all extremely ultraviolet, and show prominent H-beta and H-gamma absorption lines. However, they each completely lack any sign of H-alpha absorption. Explanations of these spectra in terms of composite systems, or light dominated by accretion disks, or as emission perfectly cancelling absorption, all have difficulties. We propose to obtain both short and long wavelength IUE spectra of each of the six, with goals of deriving the energy distribution over a much broader range than currently available, the possible unambiguous detection of a hot component if the systems are composite, and a model-independent derivation of the interstellar extinction through the depth of the 2200 A absorption feature. It seems likely that these objects form a homogeneous and previously unrecognized interesting stellar subgroup.|Y
HSFBS|An Investigation of Global Spectral Peculiarities in the NGC 6231 Main Sequence B Stars|Blair D.|Savage|Wisconsin|Three IUE shifts are requested to obtain high resolution SWP spectra of three early main sequence B stars in the young open cluster NGC 6231. A fourth shift will be used to obtain high resolution SWP spectra of MK standards. During 1982, we obtained low resolution IUE spectra of seven main sequence B stars in this cluster as part of a project investigating extinction and continua of stars in H II regions. All of the NGC 6231 B stars display abnormally strong C IV and Si IV resonance line absorption compared to spectra of similar stars from either the Wu et al . IUE Spectral Atlas or two other open clusters observed as part of our program. Since the spectral anomalies in NGC 6231 are global, very few physical explanations are possible. High resolution SWP data will enable us to distinguish between them.|Y
HSFCC|Superficially Normal Early B Stars with Sharp Spectral Lines|Charles R.|Cowley|Michagan|This is a proposal to investigate the relative strengths of metal lines in superficially normal early-to mid-B stars. The target objects have been chosen from stars with sharp spectral lines which are (statistically) slow rotators. Such stars are well known to show (develop?) chemical peculiarities among the late B and A types. Both anomalous excesses and/or deficiencies of elements are found; exceptions are rare among the slow rotators. We therefore believe that an ultraviolet survey of such early and mid-B stars has an excellent chance of finding new peculiarity types, as well as recognizing old types extending to a hotter temperature domain. Indeed, failure to find such peculiarities would require a careful rethinking of our current ideas about abundance anomalies on the upper main sequence. Percentage of exposures by exposure duration: 88% <10 min; 12% 10-30 min.|Y
HSFCW|Photometric Standards for Space Telescope Instruments|Chi-Chao|Wu|CSC|We propose to obtain high quality spectra for stars which can be used to calibrate and serve as photometric standards for the Space Telescope (ST) science instruments. The primary objective of this program is to provide the best possible absolute UV energy distribution for stars which can be observed by ST instruments. Scientific investigation of the properties of the stars is our secondary goal. Targets were chosen to tie the fundamentally calibrated stars with those which are faint enough for ST instruments. Other considerations are: reasonably good sky coverage to minimize ST slew time; sufficient range in brightness (9^m in the visual and ~12^m in the UV) to establish and correct for the non-linearity of the ST instruments; and some redundancy to guard against unexpected UV variability. Existing IUE data is not suitable for our program which requires spectra of uniform quality, and taken over a short time period to minimize the effects of any instrumental sensitivity variations. Fainter stars must be observed during the low radiation shift 1 time to insure that the background subtraction is minimal. Furthermore, our program requires intentional overexposures of selected targets to get good signal-to-noise ratios where the IUE sensitivity is low.|Y
HSFES|High Resolution Ultraviolet Observations of Hot Subdwarf B Stars|Edward M.|Sion|Villanova|We propose to observe three hot subdwarf B stars in the high dispersion mode. Our targets represent the first IUE observations at any resolution of "pure" sdB stars (not sdO or sdOB). our scientific objectives are to (1) analyze observed element over or under abundances in order to test the theoretical predictions of gravitational-thermal diffusion/radiative acceleration theory, (2) further our knowledge of chemical abundance patterns in hot subdwarfs, specifically here, the sdB stars, as a means of comparing these abundance patterns with those of the sdO and sdOB stars, and (3) confront our derived metal abundances from high resolution sdB spectra with a unique theoretical framework, the first available time dependent envelope models for subdwarfs including the effects of gravitational diffusion and radiative acceleration.|Y
HSFGD|The Best Possible UV Line List from RR TEL|George A.|Doschek|NRL|The object of this proposal is to obtain the best possible high dispersion spectra of the slow nova RR Tel. This strong emission line source can provide an excellent line-list for UV astronomy, which may also have important implications for atomic physics. Since the longest current exposures are only 3 hours, there is scope for a considerably deeper study.|Y
HSFJD|Ultraviolet Spectroscopy of Subluminous O Stars|John S.|Drilling|Louisiana State|Observing time is requested to obtain high-resolution spectra of 8 newly discovered subluminous O stars. These stars appear to cover a wide range of surface gravities and atmospheric abundances, and some of them may be among the hottest known subdwarfs. A number of them have low-resolution spectra which resemble those of central stars of planetary nebulae.|Y
HSFJH|Combined Voyager and IUE Energy Distributions for Hot Degenerate Stars|Jay B.|Holberg|USC|It is proposed to obtain low resolution IUE spectra of a selected number of hot white dwarfs and OB subdwarfs all of which have been (or are scheduled to be) observed with the Voyager ultraviolet spectrometers. The absolute IUE fluxes in the ~1175 to 3200 A region would then be combined with absolute Voyager fluxes covering the region ~900 to 1200 A and available ground based spectrophotometry or photometry in order to yield as complete as possible an energy distribution from 6000 A to the Lyman limit at 912 A. The energy distributions would then be compared against appropriate model atmosphere predictions in order to obtain improved temperatures for these objects.|Y
HSFSA|Elemental Abundances in Sharp-Lined Late B and Early A Stars|Saul J.|Adelman|The Citadel|We propose to combine ultraviolet and optical spectroscopic and spectrophotometric data for three sharp-lined late B and early A type field stars to derive in a thorough, selfconsistent analysis, the abundances of the elements in their photospheres. The use of IUE spectra will allow more complete coverage of the periodic table than is possible with the optical spectra alone and will also allow consistency checks between the two wavelength domains. This study and our previous study HSDSA begin the process of establishing reference standard abundances with which one may compare the chemically peculiar stars, lying in the same part of the HR diagram. Further these abundance determinations will provide insight into recent galactic chemical evolution in the solar neighborhood and will given some information about the starto-star scatter in elemental abundances for stars near spectral type AOV, which fall within a narrower range of ages than do late type stars. One of these stars has been observed previously by one of us (DSL) with IUE. However, the statistical quality of these individual images must be improved to justify exhaustive quantitative analyses. Therefore, we propose to obtain four high dispersion images of each star at each of the required exposure levels in SWP and in LWR.|Y
HSFTS|A Study of Moderate Ionization in Be Star Winds|Theodore P.|Snow|Lab for Atmospheric & Space Physics|We propose to use the IUE to obtain high-dispersion far ultraviolet line profiles of resonance transitions of two species of moderate ionization( SIII (1190-1202 A) and SiIII (1206 A)) in the winds of bright Be stars. Both lines are sensitive indicators of low density gas in the winds of early B stars and are in an ionization range which is typical of the bulk of the wind material. In two stars, preliminary Copernicus data has indicated that these lines are variable. We therefore propose to document the behavior of SIII and SiIII in Be star envelopes. Since all of the program stars are bright, only U.S. shift 2 time will be required.|Y
HSGAP|Ultraviolet Observations of "High Mass" Field Horizontal A Stars|A.G.Davis|Philip|Wesleyan University|The study of horizontal branch (HE) A-stars presents an opportunity to test stellar structure calculations for Population II stars in an advanced evolutionary state. Optical photometry and spectroscopy has revealed a group of HE A-stars which have anamalouslv high masses -is derived semi-empirically from colors and theory. Only two of them have been observed in the ultraviolet and both are peculiar! they are also unusual in the infrared.  We propose to make UV observations of the "high mass" HB  A-Stars and some previously unobserved HE A7-stars with similar optical colors. We wish to determine whether the UV characteristics of the high-mass group -are a general feature of the group, it is possible that some of these objects are binary and could provide a direct measure of the masses independentlv of theory. If they are not, then their unusual energy distributions will be exceptionally diffficult to understand in terms of current theories.|Y
HSGAT|Continuum Energy Distribution of O-Type Stars|Ana V.|Torres|Colorado|Knowledge of the overall energy distribution of O-type stars will allow us to determine how well the dereddened continua match the current model atmospheres, and will provide important information on local ,ariations of the interstellar extinction law. These observations will be combined with absolute spectrophotometry in the optical region that has already been obtained with the Intensified Reticon Scanner (IRS) at Kitt Peak National Observatory, thus we will have a wavelength coverage from 1200 A to 8200 A.  Garmany et al (1994) have found very large variations of the interstellar extinction law by looking at the continuum distribution (from  1200 A to 7000 A) of Wolf-Rayet (W-R) stars. This peculiar extinction can be circumstellar in origin or it can be characteristic of the interstellar medium By looking at 0-type stars Jr. the same association as the WR observed by Garmany et al we will be able to resolve this issue.|Y
HSGBM|The Nature of the UV Excess Objects with Missing H-Alpha|Bruce|Margon|Washington|During a photographic/spectroscopic survey of the plane of the Milky Way for faint UV-excess objects, we have discovered a subset of eight 15-16th magnitude stars which defy easy classification.

Explanations of these spectra in terms of composite systems, or light dominated by accretion disks, or as emission perfectly cancelling absorption, all have difficulties. We propose to obtain both short and long wavelength IUE spectra of each of the eight, with goals of deriving the energy distribution over a much broader range than currently available, the possible unambiguous detection of a hot component if the systems are composite, and a modelindependent derivation of the interstellar extinction through the depth of the 2200A absorption feature. It seems likely that these objects form a homogenous and previously unrecognized interesting stellar subgroup.|Y
HSGBS|A Study of the Most Luminous Supergiants in the LMC|Blair D.|Savage|Wisconsin|We propose to analyse low dispersion IUE data for BO-0.5 stars in the LMC in order to determine their instrinsic energy distributions. The sample will consist of stars with absolute magnitudes ranging from 3.8 to -8.1 mag. Observations of the lower luminosity stars will be employed to determine the foreground extinction to the LMC so that a sequence of intrinsic UV colors can be determined for a set of stars with the same spectral type and a luminosity range of about a factor of 20,000. An initial examination of the data indicates that previous determinations of the UV colors for the most luminious stars may contain errors larger than 50%! Since these stars are of considerable interest to stellar evolution theory, reliable estimates of their intrinsic UV continua are central to the proposed study.|Y
HSGCG|Ultraviolet Continua of B and Be Stars|Carol A.|Grady|CSC|We propose to use the IUE to obtain low-dispersion far ultraviolet continuum flux distributions for a group of rapidly rotating, lightly reddened B and Be stars in the ScoCen association. The ultraviolet continuous energy distribution of a rapidly rotating early-type star is particularly sensitive to both the equatorial rotation velocity and the angle of inclination of the stellar rotation axis to the observer's line of sight. This data set will be used to study any systematic differences between rotating B and Be stars at similar vsini and spectral type, as well as indicating the frequency and nature of any circumstellar extinction. The data will also be compared against model flux distributions for rapidly rotating B stars., Since all of the program stars are bright, only US shift 2 time will be required.|Y

HSGDB|Helium-Weak Photospheres and Stellar Winds|Douglas N.|Brown|Washington|Magnetically-controlled stellar winds have recently been discovered on several helium-strong stars, thereby expanding the known mass loss domain of the upper main sequence. Observations of helium-strong stars having different rotational periods reveal a complex interplay of magnetic, radiative and rotational forces in determining the character of the winds. The helium weak stars are somewhat cooler than the helium-strong stars and have recently been found to possess strong magnetic fields; one has been found to possess a rotationally modulated stellar wind. We propose to continue our investigation of magnetically controlled mass loss in helium-weak stars by observing UV resonance wind features. Comparison of magnetic and nonmagnetic, rapidly and slowly-rotating candidates in a range of temperatures will elucidate the relative importance of magnetic, radiative, and rotational forces.  In parallel, and using the same IUE observations, measurement of UV photospheric diagnostic features will make it possible to disentangle the contributions of temperature, abundance, and electron density inhomogenity in producing the observed spectrum and photometric variations.|Y
HSGFW|Low-Resolution Ultraviolet Observations of Hot B Subdwarfs|Francois|Wesemael|Montreal|The aim of this project is co obtain ultraviolet energy distributions for a sample of hoc B subdwarfs. This is part of a comprehensive program aimed at better understanding the properties and evolutionary status of these stars. The ultraviolet data will be combined with photometric and spectrophotometric optical data and these will be analyzed with the help of detailed model atmosphere calculations. Ultraviolet spectrophotometry provides a sensitive discriminant of the effective temperature in these relatively hot stars (25,000 K < Te < 40,000 K). With reliable determinations of the temperature, analyses of the optical data will yield improved values of the gravity and the H/He ratio in these stars. The ultimate goal of this program is to understand the physical processes (convection, diffusion, radiative forces) that are at work in the atmospheres and envelopes of sdB stars, and their effects on the superficial chemical composition of these objects.|Y
HSGGS|Ultraviolet Spectral Classification of B Stars Using IUE Archive Data|George|Sonneborn|CSC|Previous studies of ultraviolet spectral classification have been insufficient to establish a comprehensive classification system for ultraviolet spectra of early-type stars because of inadequate spectral resolution. We propose to initiate a new study of ultraviolet spectral classification of B stars using high-dispersion IUE archival data. High-dispersion SWP spectra of MK standards and other B stars will be retrieved from the IUE archives and numerically degraded to a uniform resolution of 0.25 or 0.50A. The spectra (in the form of plots or photowrites) will then be visually examined with the aim of setting up a two-dimensional classification matrix. We will follow the method used to create the MK classification system for visual spectra. The purpose of this work is to examine the applicability of the MK system (and in particular, the set of standard stars) in the ultraviolet, and to establish classification criteria in this spectral region. We also intend to produce an atlas of standard spectra that will enable other IUE observers to situate existing observations, as well as newly observed objects, in a two- (or multi-) dimensional framework. Images taken before 1981 will be reprocessed to eliminate spectral extraction errors which introduce spurious absorption features shortward of 1400A.|Y
HSGJD|Ultraviolet Spectroscopy of Subluminous O Stars|John S.|Drilling|Louisiana State|Observing time is requested to obtain low- and high-resolution spectra of 15 newly-discovered subluminous O stars. These stars occupy a previously empty region of the H-R diagram bounded by the central stars of planetary nebulae, the hottest white dwarfs, and previously known sdO's, and evidence has been found that the abundances of H, He, C, N, and Fe vary widely from star to star. We believe that detailed spectroscopic studies of these stars, both in the UV and in the visible, will be crucial to our understanding of stellar evolution immediately preceding the white dwarf state.|Y
HSGSA|Elemental Abundances of Mercury-Manganese Stars|Saul J.|Adelman|The Citadel|We propose to obtain IUE spectra of two sharp-lined non-magnetic chemically peculiar HgMn stars, using observational and data-reduction techniques which we have previously utilized in studying normal B and A stars with IUE. These techniques, involving the registration and coaddition of numerous images taken at various exposure levels at several different points in the large aperture, yield quantitative data in which both random and fixed pattern noise has been suppressed to a large degree and which are, therefore, suitable for detailed spectral synthesis. Previous studies of HgMn stars by several workers, while suitable as exploratory efforts, were compromised by rather poor signal-to noise in the data used. Our studies of normal stars with IUE provide a consistent framework within which to study the more exotic peculiar stars. We hope to derive abundances over a wide segment of the periodic table, to search for evidence of abundance anomalies not found in optical data, to use resonance and/or low excitation lines to re-assess abundance anomalies previously found from higher excitation optical lines, to search for evidence of atmospheric stratification or departures from LTE, and ultimately to provide some critical tests of the diffusion model for the production of the anomalous abundances.|Y
HSGWF|High Dispersion Observations of the Central Star of NGC 7293|Walter A.|Feibelman|NASA/GSFC|Preliminary, short exposures of the central star of NGC 7293 by Kudritzki et al. during the 6th year episode of IUE indicate that in addition to photospheric features of C IV and N V, a large number of Fe VI lines were observed. These observations were, however, not of sufficient length to obtain the desired signal to noise ratios, and we would therefore like to obtain a combined 16 hr SWP spectrogram to be started al; Vilspa and then to be finished at GSFC.|Y
HSGWW|Variability of Ultraviolet Line Ratios in Early Type Stars|Wayne L.|Waldron|A. R. Corp.|The location of the source of X-ray emission from early type stars is presently unknown. The base coronal model predicts that the ultraviolet resonance line ratios of CIV(1550)/NV(1240) and CIV(1550)/SiIV(1400) vary in opposite senses when subjected to changes in either coronal emission measure, coronal temperature, or mass loss rate. This behavior, and its application to understanding variability in ultraviolet lines, will be discussed. An initial search for this variability is currently in progress focusing on stars which are known to be X-ray variables. The preliminary results indicate that the predicted behavior in the line ratios is present. A further search for this predicted variability will be conducted for a larger class of early type stars using existing IUE data.|Y
HSHGS|Ultraviolet Flux Distributions in Later-Type B and Be Stars|George|Sonneborn|CSC|Analysis of ultraviolet spectra of B and Be stars has been directed primarily toward the study of stellar winds and interstellar extinction, with little attention given to the continuous flux distribution of these stars, particularly at the later B spectral types. Many studies typically assume that the underlying photospheric flux distributions are accurately described by those of slowly rotating standard stars, even though many B stars, and most Be stars, are known to be rapidly rotating.  Theoretical studies have shown that the ultraviolet continuous energy distribution of a rapidly rotating early-type star is particularly sensitive to the equatorial rotation velocity and the inclination angle of the rotation axis to the observer's line of sight. This is particularly true at wavelengths near the nominal peak of the energy distribution for a given spectral type. For later-type B stars this occurs in the wavelength range of the SWP camera, making the largest rotation effects observable with IUE, without supporting observations in other wavelength regions.  We propose to extend our current observing program to spectral types B5-B9 and determine the flux distributions of a group of rapidly rotating B and Be stars with very low interstellar reddening. The data will be examined for systematic differences between rotating and non-rotating B stars and between B and Be stars with similar v sin i and spectral type, as well as for evidence of circumstellar extinction in the Be stars. The spectra will also be compared against model flux distributions for rapidly rotating B stars. The study should provide better understanding of B and Be star photospheres, with benefits not only for analysis of the stars themselves and their local environs, but also for study of the interstellar medium.|Y
HSHJH|Narrow Absorption Components in Early-Type Stars|Joy|Heckathorn|STScI|The prime goal of the proposed archival search is to investigate and quantify the occurrence of narrow, blueshifted high-velocity absorption components in P Cygni profiles of early type stars, including O, Oe, Of, sdO, B and Be stars of all luminosity classes. Previous statistical studies carried out by us on a limited number of stars have shown that these narrow components occur in at least 50% of OB stars brighter than about M(bol) = -7 and in Be stars. Also some subdwarfs are known to exhibit these narrow lines. Studies of specific stars have shown that the narrow lines are often variable, both in strength and velocity, and, in some cases, are transient. Although there is presently no agreement on their origin, it is clear that these narrow, high-velocity components are formed in stellar winds of the stars and that they may play a major role in understanding stellar wind structure and the Be phenomenon.  We propose to carry out a complete search of all available highresolution SWP images obtained with IUE of O and B stars. We will produce microfiche plots of the Si III, N V, Si IV and C IV regions (12 orders) and use these to identify the presence of narrow components. The results will be used (1) to establish the locations in a HR diagram where these narrow absorptions occur, (2) to investigate further if their presence is related to stellar properties such as rotation, luminosity, Oe, Of, Be characteristics, stellar wind signatures and/or non-radial oscillation behavior, (3) to identify the degree of variability and time scales for the individual objects, and (4) to produce a microfiche copy of the spectral regions of interest and make this copy available to other investigators for different purposes (spectral diagnostics, interstellar surveys, abundance studies, etc.).|Y
HSHRD|The Nature of the UV Excuss Objects with Missing H Alpha|Ronald A.|Downes|A. R. Corp.|During a survey of the plane of the Milky Way for faint UV-excess objects, I have discovered a subset of seven 15-16th magnitude stars which defy easy classification. They are all extremely ultraviolet, show prominent H-beta and H-gamma absorption lines, but the strength of the H-alpha absorption line is variable, with the objects sometimes completely lacking any sign of H-alpha. An IUE SWP spectrum of one of the objects reveals both emission and absorption features. Explanations of these spectra in terms of composite systems, or light dominated by accretion disks, or as emission perfectly cancelling absorption, all have difficulties. I propose to obtain both short and long wavelength IUE spectra of four of the seven objects, with the goals of deriving the energy distribution, the possible unambiguous detection of a hot component if the systems are composite, and a model-independent derivation of the interstellar extinction through the depth of the 2200A feature.|Y
HSHRP|C IV Emission in Be Stars|Ronald S.|Polidan|Arizona|In the seven years of IUE observations of Be stars only two stars have been shown to have strong permanent C IV emission: Phi Persei and HD 33599. We propose to investigate the C IV emission in these stars in order to establish the characteristics of the emission, its relationship to other lines in the stellar spectrum, and its possible origin. We also propose to explore a few selected Be stars for which either poor IUE data or ground based data suggest that C IV emission may be present.  The data for Phi Persei is archival data only, NO NEW DATA is requested for this star. An analysis of the 17 SWP images available show probable periodic variations in the absorption component of the C IV line. With the entire data base these variations will be explored with the goals of documenting this variability and searching for an association with the orbital motion of Phi Persei. This may provide information on the location and distribution of the C IV in the system. New observations of HD 33599 will be obtained and combined with the existing (2) spectra for comparison with Phi Persei. Four stars (HD 61355, HD 135718 HD 173219, and HD 218674 will be explored for C IV emission.|Y
HSICG|Survey of Stellar Winds in Be Stars|Carol A.|Grady|CSC|A survey of IUE observations of stellar winds in B and Be stars has begun to reveal the ways in which the winds in Be stars differ from those observed in normal B stars. In general Be stellar winds are stronger, more highly ionized Marlborough and Peters 1982), and more variable than winds seen in normal stars. Moreover, the Be stellar winds are dominated by the presence of shortward-shifted narrow absorption components (SNCs) which are superficially similar to similar features in O stars, but which occur over a wider velocity range in the Be stars and are more strikingly variable. A survey of 32 Be stars included in the Larger B and Be wind survey has shown that Be stars with v sin i < 150 km/s rarely show SNCs or winds which are stronger than normal B star winds. The few Be stars in the survey with 150<v sin i<200 km/s sometimes showed SNC absorption, while those with v sin i>200 km/s frequently showed SNC absorption in at Least one IUE spectrum. This correlation of Be wind properties and projected rotational velocity has not previously been observed. In order to confirm the reality of our results, we need to examine a Larger number of stars. The IUE archives already contain spectra of an additional 22 Be stars which will be suitable for our analysis. If the results of the preliminary survey are supported by the extension of the sample to a larger number of objects and observations, it may be possible to associate specific wind profile characteristics WITH the aspect angle of the underlying star, and hence to constrain models for the production of strong and variable stellar winds in these objects.|Y
HSIDM|A Study of Photospheric Silicon and Carbon Lines in Early B Stars|Derck|Massa|A. R. Corp.|It is demonstrated that available models of the UV line spectra of silicon and carbon in early B stars are seriously inadequate for stars above the main sequence. We propose to measure equivalent widths of selected silicon and carbon lines in a set of B stars with a wide range of atmospheric conditions. These measurements will help determine how the physics contained in current model calculations must be modified.|Y
HSIGP|Abundances in Four Sharp-Lined, Early B-Type Stars|Geraldine J.|Peters|USC|Using high resolution IUE spectra which have been co-added to reduce both random and fixed pattern noise, we propose to determine abundances, especially of Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Ni, and other heavy elements, in four carefully selected early B-type stars. The program stars HR 1887 (B0.5 V), HR 1886 (B1 V), 1 Her (B3 IV), and Xi Oct (B6 IV) display the lowest values of v Sin i of all normal objects within their spectral classes. With the exception of an exploratory investigation using the published Copernicus Ul atlases of l Her and tau Sco (cf. Peters and Polidan 1985), abundances for the above-mentioned iron group elements had never before been determined for the early B stars since there are no measurable lines from these elements in such star's visible spectra. The inclusion of the mid-B star Xi Oct in our program allows us to relate these studies to those of six late B and early A-type normal stars (Leckrone and Adelman 1986). A careful determination of iron group abundances from observation will allow one to check theoretical calculations of the nucleosynthesis of light elements (especially those involving silicon burning). Voyager UVS continuum data (900-1700A), which already exist for l Her and will be secured for Xi Oct, and new ground-based observations of the Balmer line profiles (H-alpha-H-delta) will aid in the selection of the model atmosphere which best represents each star. Since HR 1887/HR 1886 are separated by only 4011, we will obtain their FUV energy distributions with the low resolution cameras on IUE. For each object we propose to co-add four high resolution SWP images optimized for 1500, 1940 taken at different positions in the large aperture and three similarly obtained LWP images optimized for 2200, 2400 and 2740. These spectra will also serve as templates for planning observations with the HRS on the Hubble Space Telescope.|Y
HSIJD|UV Spectroscopy of Very Hot Subdwarf O Stars|John S.|Drilling|Louisiana State|Observing time is requested to obtain high and low resolution spectra of 6 very hot sdO stars. In the HR diagram, these stars occupy a region bounded by the nuclei of planetary nebulae, the hottest white dwarfs, and cooler sdO stars, and evidence has been found that the abundances of H, He, C, N, and Fe vary widely from star to star. We believe that detailed spectroscopic studies of these stars, both in the UV and in the visible, will be crucial to our understanding of stellar evolution immediately preceding the white dwarf state.|Y
HSINM|Winds in Hot Main-Sequence Stars|Nancy D.|Morrison|Toledo|The resonance doublets of C IV and N V in 09 - B2 IV-V stars will be studied, in order to determine the dependence of mass-loss rate on the stellar parameters. These stars lie near the low-luminosity boundary of the domain of radiation-driven winds in the H-R Diagram, and we expect that a systematic study will offer new insight into the nature of these winds. Only members of clusters and associations or subgroups with well-determined distances will be included. The sample of stars is selected with special attention to sources of systematic error. For example, in order to eliminate stellar pulsation as a variable, we included only stars known to be photometrically constant.  The determination of mass-loss rates and luminosities will use newly derived effective temperatures and new estimates of the ionization balance in the wind, both based an a non-LTE line-blanketed model-atmosphere code by Anderson (1985).|Y
HSIRB|UV Spectrophotometry of Blue Stars in the Landolt Standard Areas for HST Calibration|Ralph C.|Bohlin|STScI|The purpose of this proposal is to complete the program of UV Spectrophotometric Standards for the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) by observing one target in each of four ground based standard selected regions. These standard selected regions have been neglected in previous IUE proposals for HST standard calibration sources. To account for the time change in IUE sensitivity, a companion proposal for IUE archival work has been submitted.|Y
HSJEF|Low-Dispersion Observations of Bright Stars|Edward L.|Fitzpatrick|Colorado - CASA|Seven US2 observing shifts are being requested to obtain low-dispersion SWP and LWP spectra of approximately 15 bright, nearby early-type stars. The targets are taken from the 10-year old effective temperature and bolometric correction study of Code, Davis, Bless, and Hanbury Brown (CDBB). The CDBB stars represent the only sample of stars for which angular diameter measurements are available. The stars which we plan to observe have been unobservable with the low-dispersion mode of IUE in the past because of their extreme brightness; however, the recent refinements in the fast-trailing technique now allow optimally exposed spectra to be obtained. With the new spectra and with Archival spectra which are available for some of the less bright CDBB stars, we plan to repeat the earlier effective temperature and bolometric correction determinations, taking advantage of the higher photometric stability and higher resolution of IUE over previous ultraviolet missions and utilizing improvements in the ground-based optical/lR data and calibrations. This study will tie the large IUE database into a system of fundamental stellar effective temperature and bolometric correction determinations.|Y
HSJGP|Multifrequency Observations of the Rapid Variable Be Stars|Geraldine J.|Peters|USC|To investigate possible phase dependent variations in photospheric temperature, luminosity, projected surface area, and mass loss in Be stars which show rapid variations in their optical light (0^m.02-0^m.1 in 0.2-2 days), we propose simultaneous Voyager, IUE, and ground-based photometric and spectroscopic (Reticon) observations of selected objects over one cycle In their light curves. Although rapid variations have been confirmed in over 40 Be stars, and suspected in many others, the cause for this photometric variability and how it relates to the Be phenomenon, in general, are unknown. Two currently popular ideas explain the variability as a result of nonradial pulsations or star spots. Progress on understanding these stars has been impeded because existing data bases are fragmentary. Similtaneous, multifrequency observations of a few stars at several locations worldwide are necessary. We intend to achieve this in this proposed project. Time-resolved continuum observations spanning a decade in wavelength from the Voyager UVS (900-1700A), low resolution IUE cameras (1200-3000A), and ground-based photometers (3000-9000A) located at several sites will be used to directly obtain values for the cyclic change in temperature and luminosity and thus constrain the proposed models. Any flux redistribution from the FUV to longer wavelengths will become evident. Estimates of AT and AL will allow us to infer the cyclic change in the projected area of the stellar surface. High resolution IUE (SWP) observations will reveal any cyclic modulation of the circumstellar environment (wind, shell) while the Reticon data (from telescopes in Europe and the United States) will provide information on any photospheric activity such as nonradial pulsations and allow us to assess whether the rapid light variations are a result of such pulsations. European collaboration for the IUE observations has been established to achieve more continuous coverage. Our program stars are confirmed rapid variables and nonradial pulsators for which periods are known. Primary targets are Omikron And, A Eri and omega Ori; KY And is a secondary target.|Y
HSKCB|The Wind Variability of Zeta OPH and Zeta PUP|C. Thomas|Bolton|Canada|We propose to obtain coordinated optical and UV spectroscopy of both the photosphere and the wind of zeta Ophiuchi (09 V) and/or zeta Puppis (O4 If). These data will be used to seek correlated variability patterns in an attempt to determine whether photospheric variations (which are believed to arise from nonradial pulsational velocity fields) play a significant role in the initiation or progress of the variable opacity enhancements in the winds of these stars.|Y
HSKCG|The Nature of the Luminous Blue Variables|Catharine D.|Garmany|Colorado - CASA|Luminous Blue Variables is a general term for a group of high mass, luminous hot stars which include the Hubble-Sandage variables, S Doradus variables and P-Cygni variables. They are characterized by their high intrinsic luminosities, enormous mass loss rates during outbursts (10 -4 M(sun)yr-1), optical variability, and positions at the upper end of the H-R diagram near the Humphreys-Davidson limit. These stars, and in particular P-Cygni type stars, appear to be progenitors of Wolf-Rayet stars and descendents of massive O stars which never undergo a red supergiant phase. However, there is as yet very little information on their masses or possible binary nature.  For resolving the nature of P-Cygni like stars and thus in turn all LBVs, the LMC star R81 is very important. This star has generally been considered a close counterpart of P-Cygni itself, with similar Teff, M(bol), radius, and similar wind characteristics. However, recently Stahl et al (1987) derived a light curve solution typical for an eclipsing binary. No other LBV star has clearly been shown to be a binary, making R81 unique for studies of the properties of these stars.  We propose to obtain high resolution IUE spectra of R81 during its eclipse phase in a collaborative effort with our European investigators. Since R81's peak brightness is in the uv, the observed integrated flux should give a good estimate of its total bolometric luminosity. Our primary goals are: 1) obtain an estimate of the M(bol) of the primary, 2) clarify the nature of the secondary companion, and 3) study stellar mass loss variations as a function of eclipse phase.|Y
HSKJN|High Resolution Observations of the Early-Type Halo Star PHl1580|Joy|Nichols-Bohlin|CSC IUE|Recently, as part of a survey of faint early-type stars al high galactic latitudes, high resolution optical spectra were obtained of PHL1580. A preliminary analysis of these observations using LTE and non-LTE model atmosphere techniques indicates that the star is not a low mass, subluminous object but a normal, massive Population I star at a z-distance of approximately 17 kpcs. When combined with estimates of the stellar age and current velocity, these results imply that PHL1580 must have formed in the galactic halo at z > 15 kpc. High resolution observations of this star with IUE are essential in order to confirm the stellar mass from an analysis of the P Cygni profiles.|Y
HSLHB|Ultraviolet Monitoring of Irregulary Variable Planetary Nuclei|Howard E.|Bond|STScI|We have used ground-based photometry to identify a new group of irregularly variable central stars of planetary nebulae. The variations have amplitudes of a few hundredths of a magnitude, and timescales of a few hours. The presence of such optical light variations is strongly correlated with the presence of ultraviolet P Cygni wind profiles, suggesting that the light variations may arise from short-timescale variations in the mass-loss rate.  We propose to explore this phenomenon further, by carrying out simultaneous groundbased photometric monitoring while we obtain sequences of IUE short-wavelength spectra. We have identified an optimum target, the nucleus of IC 418, which is wen placed for simultaneous Kitt Peak and IUE observations, and is bright enough for high-dispersion SWP spectra to be obtained in a reasonable exposure time. The aim of the program is to look for variations in the UV wind profiles and, if they exist, to correlate their behavior with the optical light variability.|Y
HSLPM|Stellar Winds in the Hot Stars of Nearby Galaxies|Philip|Massey|KPNO|We are proposing to continue our 5 year long program of studying the hot, massive stars of nearby galaxies. This project is aimed at understanding how stellar winds are modified by metallicity, and to study the UV extinction laws in other galaxies. Our exposures on these faint stars have been extraordinarily successful, and our results astonishing: the resonance lines of hot stars in M31 and M33 are all weaker than those of their Galactic counterparts, with no sign of P Cygni emission, and low terminal velocities (Hutchings, Massey, Bianchi 1987 Ap. J. Lett., 322, L79). Our optical data is also suggestive of differences in the stellar wind laws of massive stars in M31. In addition, we have found that the UV extinction law in both M33 and M31 resembles that of the LMC or SMC, being steeper and with a smaller 2200 A feature. These results imply a major revision in our thinking about stellar wind laws and how they differ in different environments, but the number of objects we have so far obtained is very small, and it is possible that the stars we have examined thus far are merely the pathological, as they tend to be the brightest. It is therefore crucial to confirm these results for additional stars, and to begin to probe differences within a galaxy such as might be expected to be seen as a function of galactocentric distances. With new ground-based techniques (multi-object, fiber-fed spectroscopy on the KPNO 4-m) we are now obtaining spectra of a large sampling of hot stars, allowing us to pick the best additional candidates for these IUE studies.|Y
HSMKB|IUE Observations of Selected Hot Stars Coordinated with Wuppe|Karen S.|Bjorkman|Wisconsin|The Wisconsin Ultraviolet Photo-Polarimeter Experiment (WUPPE) is part of the ASTRO payload currently scheduled for launch on STS-35 on 26 April 1990. WUPPE is designed to obtain ultraviolet spectropolarimetry of a wide variety of astronomical objects. One of our major scientific objectives is to obtain UV spectropolarimetry of hot stars: supergiants, Be stars, and Wolf-Rayet stars. These data will be used to investigate the nature of the material in the atmospheres of these objects. Changes in polarization across spectral lines can provide information about the location and geometric characteristics of the line forming regions in the winds of hot stars. The winds from these stars are known to have variable column densities, terminal velocities, and to exhibit variable structure in the form of discrete absorption components. Similarly, the column density of the circumstellar shells surrounding several of our program stars are known to be highly variable. Critical data for the full interpretation of the UV spectropolarimetry are the state of the wind and the shell absorption for our program stars as close in time as feasible to the WUPPE observations. These data cannot be derived directly from the WUPPE spectra, due to the instrument's 6 A resolution. Detailed information on the state of the stellar winds and circumstellar envelopes in our WUPPE targets can be most directly obtained from high dispersion spectra obtained at or near the time of the WUPPE observations.  Therefore, we propose obtaining high dispersion SWP and LWP observations of 14 hot stars which will be observed with WUPPE. These stars are considered the best candidates for detecting polarimetric line effects on the basis of ground-based visual spectropolarimetric observations. The observations should be made during the 10-day ASTRO mission which is currently slated to begin 26 April 1990.|Y
HSRSP|Confirming Detections of Hot Secondary Stars|Sidney B.|Parsons|CSC - Astronomy Programs|We propose to observe middle and late-type giant and supergiant stars whose previous UV data indicate the presence of a hot component, but which lack adequate UV information for definitive analysis. Some of the secondaries are seen weakly in optical spectra but cannot be classified accurately, while others are UV discoveries. The companions apparently lie on the upper main sequence, thus their accurate temperature classifications from the IUE spectra will lead to good estimates of their luminosities. These in turn can be used to derive more accurate luminosities than can now be done for individual giants and supergiants. Since the companions contribute little light in the optical region, some of these binaries can be useful in calibrating the upper end of the Wilson-Bappu relationship. Combined with previous IUE observations, this project will yield a total sample of 100 giant or supergiant absolute magnitudes, enabling both a firmer statistical base for luminosity calibrations and an opportunity to investigate temperature dependence of such calibrations.|Y

The helium weak spectra would than be compared to the normal spectra and reclassified by their UV spectra if possible. If not then the differences between the lines found in the helium weak stars and the normal stars will give an indication of gross temperature differences and gross anomalies. The differences of L and other stark broadened lines might be used to indicate density differences.|Y
HWGDB|Helium-Weak Photospheres and Stellar Winds, II: Analysis of Archival Data|Douglas N.|Brown|Washington|Magnetically-controlled stellar winds have recently been discovered on several helium-strong stars, thereby expanding the known mass loss domain of the upper main sequence. Observations of helium-strong stars having different rotational periods reveal a complex interplay of magnetic, radiative and rotational forces in determining the character of the winds. The heliumweak stars are somewhat cooler than the heliumstrong stars and have recently been found to possess strong magnetic fields; one has been found to possess a rotationally modulated stellar wind. We propose to continue our investigation of magnetically controlled mass loss in helium-weak stars by observing UV resonance wind features. Comparison of magnetic and nonmagnetic, rapidly and slowly-rotating candidates in a range of temperatures will elucidate the relative importance of magnetic, radiative, and-rotational forces.  In parallel, and using the same IUE observations, measurement of UV photospheric diagnostic features will make it possible to disentangle the contributions of temperature, abundance, and electron density inhomogenity in producing the observed spectrum and photometric variations.  This program entails a substantial amount of archival research to supplement the new observations. The current proposal addresses the archival research only; the new observations are proposed separately.|Y
HWPSS|Magnetically Controlled Circumstellar Matter Among the Helium Weak Stars|Steven N.|Shore|CSC - GHRS|We propose to observe a sample of helium weak and silicon stars around their rotation periods to search for evidence of trapped, magnetically controlled, circumstellar plasma. The sample is chosen based on groundbased optical and radio data. It is designed to extend the search for stellar magnetospheres to stars cooler than the helium strong stars, for which such regions are commonplace. We aim at delineating the physical conditions that produce both strong radio emission and dense circumstellar environments in the absence of strong, radiatively driven, stellar winds.|Y
HXPSV|Multiwavelength Observations of Her X-1|Saeqa Dil|Vrtilek|Harvard CFA - SAO|We propose to obtain IUE observations of the intermediate mass X-ray binary Her X-1 simultaneously with EUVE (10^5 sec already awarded), ROSAT (6,000s approved; 36,000s pending), and ASTRO-D (6,000s approved; 36,000s pending). Ground-based optical spectroscopy will also be undertaken. Such observations, which almost continuously span three decades in energy, will allow study of the highly variable continuum as well as line emission ranging from HeII and CIV (optical and IUE), Fe L-shell features (ROSAT), K-shell features (ASTRO-D) and Fe XVIII-XXII (EUVE). Together, the observations comprehensively examine ionized material throughout the source, from the inner edge of the accretion disk to the magnetosphere and corona.  We will interpret the results by reference to recently developed detailed models of continuum and line emission from accretion disks. Owing to its low interstellar column density, Her X-1 is the only X-ray binary that can be examined in the proposed way.|Y

HYGLH|High-Velocity Winds from Hybrid Stars|Lee W.|Hartmann|CFA|In a previous IUE program, we serendipitously discovered a high-velocity wind from the hybrid star alpha TrA (K4II). The broad absorption in the Mg II h and k line wings would not have been seen if we had not overexposed the emission line cores. Wind velocities are important to determine in order to analyze mechanisms of mass loss, and there is a strong observational bias against seeing high-velocity absorption in the faint h and k line wings of late-type stars. We request further observations of wind variability in hybrid stars, specifically aimed at detecting high velocity winds. The long exposures required will also result in detection of the C II 2326A emission lines, which are useful as a density diagnostic.|Y

Such observations can be made with IUE using quasars with redshift A. Short wavelength continua of three high-redshift quasars have already been detected with IUE. We propose to observe one of these objects with very long exposures in order to search for evidence of intergalactic helium.|Y
HZFRG|High Redshift Quarars|Richard F.|Green|Arizona|We propose to continue our long-term program of studying the far ultraviolet spectra of high redshift quasars. Our target list consists of three PG quasars, all with V ~ 15.8 and redshifts between 1.1 and 1.5, and one exciting new discovery from the S5 radio survey of V ~ 16.5 and redshift 3.4. The observations are prompted by three scientific objectives. The first is for further study of the distribution of Lyman continuum opacity with redshift, the effect of which is to steepen the observed quasar continuum below the Lyman edge. From these results we learn about the space density of Lyman-alpha forest clouds as a function of cosmic time, and can also target spectral regions of greatest interest for the High Resolution Spectrograph on Space Telescope. The possibility exists of reaching He II Ly-alpha 304 in the high redshift object, which would test for the presence of a diffuse intergalactic medium and act as a probe of primordial helium to hydrogen ratios. Secondly, we wish to study the optically thick Lyman absorption edge systems to confirm their constant density in co-moving volume and to derive their cross-sections. They also act as pointers for ground-based echelle spectroscopy to derive metal abundances and temperatures. Finally, the asymmetries in the Ly-alpha emission line profile will be compared with those in high resolution C IV and C III] profiles measured optically, and interpreted in the context of models for the broad emission line region. Further physical constraints will be provided by emission lines with wavelengths shorter than Ly-alpha.|Y
HZHMM|Long Exposures of High-Redshift Quasars|Matthew A.|Malkan|UCLA|We propose to obtain joint U.S. I/European 15-hour exposures of bright (B~ 16th mag.) high-redshift (Z- two or more) quasars to detect their far-ultraviolet continua at the shortest rest wavelengths yet studied. The 350 to 600A spectrum is a crucial input for thermal continuum models (e.g., accretion disks), as well as photoionization models of gas clouds in the broad-emission-line region and the intergalactic medium. It will also enable us to search for intergalactic absorption in several important resonance lines, including those of He I. Using IUE and ground-based spectra, we have made a careful selection of the six quasars which are most likely to have clear lines of sight at SWP wavelengths.|Y
HZIGM|A New, Bright High-Redshift BAL Quasar|Gordon M.|MacAlpine|Michigan|I have recently discovered a new high-redshift broad-absorption-line quasar with unusually strong, well-defined spectral absorption features and which is bright enough for observation with IUE. Knowledge of certain characteristics measurable with the LWP camera is necessary for accurate assessments of absorbing gas ionization conditions and chemical abundances. Objectives of this proposal are to detect and measure the requisite features, to analyze the responsible gas, and to predict broad-absorption-line quasar spectral characteristics at far ultraviolet wavelengths which may ultimately be observed with the Space Telescope.|Y
HZIJH|Very High Redshift Quasars|John P.|Huchra|CFA|We propose to extend earlier observations of very high redshift quasars to obtain higher signal/noise spectra. Observations of the ultraviolet spectra of quasars with redshifts greater than 3 enable us to (a) extend the measurements of the continuum flux distribution down to below 300 A in the quasar rest frame (b) measure or place a limit on the strength of the HeII 304 A resonance line and (c) apply the GunnPeterson test to HeII 304 A in order to measure or place a limit on the density of ionized Helium in the intergalactic medium. The proposed observations will utilize the maximum possible detection capabilities of IUE by a combination of a long exposure and very careful preparation of the SWP camera.|Y

IUE and ANS survey observations of R Arae have shown that it undergoes outside-of-eclipse ultraviolet flux variations up to a factor of two or more. A number of P Cygni lines with variable emission are present and a gas stream with a velocity of about 450 km s^-1 with respect to the primary component was detected. The system is also an x-ray source with an x-ray luminosity of 10 31-33 erg s^-1. R Arae is certainly in an interesting stage of evolution; probably at the beginning of the first stage of rapid mass transfer. We propose to study R Arae with IUE for 24 hours spread over five consecutive days.|Y
IBEMP|Interacting Close Binary Stars of Longer Period|Mirek J.|Plavec|CAL LA|A continuation is proposed of an on-going project of studying mass interaction in close binaries, specifically of the processes of accretion and mass outflow from the system. For the first time, it is possible to obtain direct evidence of mass outflow from the interacting systems from the profiles of the emission lines of highly-ionized ions in the far ultraviolet. Accretion, or better interaction of the transferred matter with the gainer, leads to a composite structure of the gainers. Extensive hydrogen clouds have already been discovered, emitting optically thin continuous radiation. It is probable that these clouds become optically thicker in the immediate vicinity of the gainer. It is proposed to observe certain eclipses with good time resolution in order to resolve these structures.  The losers in the interacting systems may be losing mass either by Roche lobe overflow or by stellar wind. It is possible that proximity to the critical lobe modifies and enhances the stellar wind emanating from the components in close binaries. This problem can be best studied on certain supergiant systems like Mu Sagittarii and Epsilon Aurigae, and on selected symbiotic stars. High-dispersion observations of these objects will serve an additional extremely important purpose, namely determination of masses and absolute dimensions of the systems. in Mu Sgr we detected a hotter component, whose eclipses and radial velocity shifts will provide all the necessary data. The very longperiodic system of Epsilon Aurigae also contains a hotter source, whose role in the system as well as the general structure of the system can be studied by observing the eclipse beginning in the summer of 1982.  Continued observations of the W Serpentis stars and of Algols promise to establish a continuous sequence of properties related to the rate of mass transfer between the components.  The above number of shifts requested represents an ideal situation; in section E, priorities are established for a more modest version of the project.|Y
IBFEB|Analysis of the Symbiotic Stars V1016 CYG, HM SGE and V1329 CYG|Edward W.|Brugel|Colorado-Lasp|We propose to analysis the archive observations of the symbiotic stars V1016 Cyg, HM Sge and to a lesser degree V1329 Cyg, with an emphasis on the high dispersion data. These data in conjunction with optical spectroscopic observations which we have already obtained and infrared observations which have been requested, will be used to provide constraints on the velocities of the various high excitation components of these complicated systems, and should considerably clarify the nature of the mass exchange interaction. These systems, also referred to as "d" symbiotic systems since they contain dust, show both evidence of extremely cool circumstellar material and, at least after an eruption, extremely hot material (very high ionization states and soft x-rays). We propose to test our particular interacting winds model, which involves a low velocity, high density, wind from the giant or Mira star and a high velocity, low density wind from a collapsed object. This model predicts multiple line components with systematic variations as a function of ionization potential, and a correlation between excitation and line width for individual features.|Y
IBFGM|IUE Spectroscopy of the Interacting Binary U Sagittae|George E.|McCluskey|Lehigh University|We propose to use IUE to further investigate the interacting Algol-type system U Sagittae. IUE survey observations of U Sge have shown the presence of Si IV and C IV resonance lines, which indicates the existence of regions considerably hotter than the B8 V spectral type of the primary would imply. Many absorption lines also show equivalent width variations of at least 50%. This system is currently in a state of active mass streaming. We propose to study U Sge with IUE for 32 hours spread over 4 or 5 consecutive days.|Y
IBFSP|HD 207739 and Other Strange F + B Binary Stars|Sidney B.|Parsons|NASA/GSFC|Several binary star systems containing an F giant or bright giant and a B or Be component, all showing strong H-alpha emission, are to be examined atmiddle to far ultraviolet wavelengths at several orbital phases each. Two previous IUE observations of HD 207739 both show strong Mg II emission but otherwise are almost totally different, changing in flux by a factor of 2 and in nature from a complex absorption-line spectrum similar to the interacting binary SX Cas to a more conventional hot star plus mild wind. We wish to learn to what extent these binaries are related to or differ from the "W Serpentis" binary systems containing hot plasma. High-resolution UV spectroscopy will be feasible and will give insight into the probable location of the plasma (envelope or accretion disk around the hot star, gas streams, and/or extended atmosphere of the cool star) and probable evolutionary status of these systems and related objects.|Y
IBGBB|Interacting F + BE Binary Stars|Bernard W.|Bopp|Toledo|Several binary star systems containing an F giant or bright giant and a Be component, all showing strong H-alpha emission, are to be examined at middle or far ultraviolet wavelengths at several orbital phases each. Previous IUE observations of some of these systems show strong MgII emission which varies in intensity and profile on a timescale of at least a few days. In one case the UV spectrum of an F + Be star showed a change in flux by a factor of two and a change in nature from a complex absorption line spectrum similar to the interacting binary SX Cas to a more conventional hot star plus mild wind. We wish to learn to what extent those binaries are related to or differ from the "W Serpentis" binary systems containing hot plasma. High-resolution UV spectroscopy will be feasible and will give insight into the probable location of the plasma (envelope or accretion disc around the hot star, gas streams, and/or extended atmosphere of the cool star) and evolutionary status of these systems and related objects.|Y
IBGGM|Accretional Heating and Gas Flow in Interacting Binaries|George E.|McCluskey|Lehigh University|High resolution spectra obtained with the IUE have revealed the presence of resonance lines due to high temperature ions, such as Si IV, C IV, and N V, in a number of Algol-type interacting binaries which do not have a component star sufficiently hot to create these ions in its photosphere. These lines are in absorption and vary with orbital phase, with time, and from system -to system. It has been suggested that gas streaming and accretional heating processes are involved in their formation. A sufficient number of high resolution IUE spectra of interacting binaries now exist to undertake a systematic study of the behavior of these lines. We propose to use IUE archival data to study the behavior of high temperature absorption lines due to Si IV, C IV, N V, and a few other ions in Algol-type binaries. This analysis will yield information on the nature of the line forming region, on accretional processes and on their dependence on the evolutionary state of the binary.|Y
IBGGP|IUE & Voyager Observations of the Early Type Contact Systems SX AUR, BF AUR and SV CEN|Geraldine J.|Peters|USC|Combining spectroscopic and photometric line and continuum data from IUE, the Voyager UVS, and ground based telescopes we propose a detailed comparative study of the early type contact binaries SX Aur, BF Aur, and SV Cen. We plan to determine the extent of the mass and angular momentum loss in SX Aur and BF Aur and compare this with that observed in SV Cen. In addition we will look for phase dependent mass loss and secular variability in the mass flow in all three systems. Based upon their published UV flux values, SX Aur and BF Aur may show a 200,OOOK, localized 'Continuum source as does SV Cen. We will-investigate this possibility and, if found, locate it in phase. Also planned is an abundance study of the stars and their circumstellar matter and a search for the presence of photospheric pulsations. Finally, light curve solutions will be produced from the combined IUE and Voyager photometry, which will provide uninterrupted flux data from 900 - 3000A, and the ground-based photometry. The extended wavelength coverage provided by IUE and Voyager will allow us to determine quite accurately the temperatures of any hot circumstellar components as well as photospheric conditions in the stars since these early type systems radiate most of their flux in the extreme-far UV. The observation plan is to alternate high and low dispersion exposures using both cameras and obtain all data within two orbital periods.|Y
IBGMP|Interacting Binaries with Thick Circumstellar Shells|Mirek J.|Plavec|UCLA|We propose to study five shell stars all of which are definitely interacting binaries with fairly long periods. These stars appear to be objects intermediate between two distinct categories of interacting binaries: the W Serpentis stars (ref. 7 in IUE-related bibliography) and the symbiotics.  The four objects that have already been studied with IUE show several common properties. They possess a dense circumstellar shell producing deep absorption lines; they are variable in light and flux distribution; and (with possibly the exception of 17 Leporis) the continuous spectra are contaminated by circumstellar hydrogen emission. All these properties complicate the determination of the characteristics of the component stars.  A new attempt is proposed here. We will study the archival data on KX And, AX Mon, and 17 Lep. We need additional IUE spectra for V644 Mon.  We propose to observe V505 Mon for the first time; it may be a very massive binary, and certainly is interesting as a binary system with a shell.  Our goal is to: (1) Determine the correct spectral types of the hotter components in KX Andromedae, AX Monocerotis, 17 Leporis, V644 Monocerotis and V505 Monocerotis. (2) Determine the flux distribution and the physical parameters of the hydrogen clouds present in these systems. (3) Determine the physical parameters, from the line profiles, of the circumstellar absorbing shells. (4) Discuss the similarities to, and differences from, the W Serpentis stars and symbiotics. Which parameters of the system decide its character? One US1 shift would be preferable, but we may try do with one US2 shift.|Y
IBGPS|Disk Developement in U Gem from One Outburst to the Next|Paula|Szkody|Washington|A direct test of current disk instability models will be accomplished through IUE and optical observations of the disk changes of a dwarf nova during a long quiescent interval from one outburst to the next. To insure that the entire disk will be involved and the ionization zone has the maximum change, a long outburst period, low mass transfer system is needed.  U Gem fulfills these criteria and is also ideal because it is among the brightest of the dwarf novae, has well known UV, optical and IR properties, and has a high inclination. The mean quiescent interval is near 4 months. One SWP and 2 LWR low dispersion spectra (taking onehalf shift) approximately every 2 weeks during this interval (with ground based spectroscopy during this same interval) will provide the necessary information about the boundary layer and ionization zone changes.|Y
IBGTA|The Interacting S Star Binary HD 35155|Thomas B.|Ake|CSC|In the course of an IUE investigation of chromospheric activity in S stars, we have discovered a hot, interacting companion to the otherwise unremarkable S star HD 35155. Intense emission lines of N V, C IV, Si IV, Si III] and C III] are superimposed on a moderately hot continuum apparently partially obscured by strong absorption features. The emission-line spectrum is of higher excitation than found in the mild Ba star 56 Peg and more closely resembles that of symbiotic stars or the recurrent nova T CrB. The absorptionline spectrum appears to be dominated by Fe II as seen in Zeta-Aur systems and the peculiar binaries SX Cas and HD 207739.  The few IUE observations available show UV variations of nearly a factor of 2 in the emission lines and continuum and suggest that the secondary is either highly variable on a time scale of weeks, with an outburst having occurred in late 1982, or that an eclipse occurred early in 1983. The variations of emission lines are found to depend upon excitation level, the highest level lines varying the greatest. The Mg II emission appears to show a strong absorption component obliterating part of the blue profile of the feature. If this is an eclipsing system, we are seeing stratification effects as different parts of the secondary are eclipsed. If the secondary is an accretion disk, the variations can be explained by changes in the physical conditions of the line forming regions at outburst.  We propose to make further IUE observations of HD 35155, the first S star known to have an interacting companion, to distinguish between the possible models for the system. Groundbased time is being requested at KPNO to study this system and other potentially interesting S and MS stars, selected by anomalous UBV colors or radial velocity variations, which we have included here as secondary targets.|Y
IBHAM|Temporal UV-Line Profile Variations in the Peculiar Object RX Puppis|Andrew G.|Michalitsianos|NASA/GSFC|The complex nature of the UV and optical emission lines observed in the peculiar nova-like star RX Puppis makes this object especially interesting for further IUE investigations. The C IV 1548 and He II 1640 emission lines are characterized by multiple structure in which seven distinct emission components in the C IV doublet have been identified. These components are predominantly redward of the rest wavelength; the highest velocity components are typically V max > +300 km s^-1. Multiple component structure is also evident in the intercombination lines of N III], N IV], O III], Si III] and C III], which suggests complex motion in the hot gaseous environment of the system. The dramatic variations observed in the emission line profiles of UV permitted and intercombination lines suggest that material motion in this system occurs on a minimum timescale of at least -6 months, i.e. the shortest time interval sampled during our previous IUE monitoring program. However, microwave observations obtained of RX Puppis at 5.0, 6.0 and 8.7 GHz indicate that its radio flux can vary by as much as 50-percent, on timescales less than 24 hours. It is extremely important to determine if the multiple structure which characterizes the C IV, He II and other lines vary on similar timescales < 24hours. Short timescale variability in line profile structure of UV resonance lines could provide important clues concerning the nature of dynamical activity between the component stars; the system is believed to consist of a hot subdwarf that tidally accretes mass from a 580-day period Mira. We propose to combine our high resolution IUE observations of RX Puppis with Very Large Array (VLA) radio data, for which observing time is presently being scheduled. Our observing program and description of general research goals follow.|Y
IBHGM|IUE Spectroscopy of the Strongly Interacting Binary TX Ursae Majoris|George E.|McCluskey|Lehigh University|We propose to use IUE to further investigate the interacting Algol-type system TX Ursae Majoris. A limited number of IUE observations of TX UMa have shown the presence of Si IV and C IV resonance lines, indicating the existence of regions considerably hotter than the B8V spectral type of the primary would imply. The strength of these lines is variable and this system is currently in a state of active mass streaming and accretion. We propose to study TX UMa with IUE for 32 hours spread over one orbital period (3.06 days). The proposed research will allow us to determine the nature of the mass flow and its accretional properties, knowledge of which is crucial to an understanding of the evolution of interacting binaries. TX UMa is one of the few active Algol-type binaries which is sufficiently bright and also has an appropriate period for a detailed study with IUE over one orbital period.|Y
IBHJE|Interacting Binaries That are Just Beginning to Initiate Mass Transfer|Joel A.|Eaton|Indiana University|A group of long-period binaries is identified which are unique in that they seem to be transferring mass from the more massive to the less massive component. A good prototype would be the bright star 5 Ceti, a 96-day binary containing a tidally distorted K giant and a faint secondary component detectable in the ultraviolet. Ultraviolet observations are proposed 1) to test the proposed model for these stars, 2) to determine the nature of the secondary components, 3) to discover other members of the group, and 4) to determine how steady is the rate at which mass is transferred.|Y
IBHJH|A Study of Mass-Exchange in Algol-Type Binaries|Johannes|Hardorp|Stony Brook|We propose to continue the research program on ultraviolet spectrophotometric observations of Algol-type binaries. For this purpose we request new observations of Delta Librae, TX UMa and Beta Persei with both short and long wavelength cameras, taken in high resolution mode at selected orbital phases. The observations will be made with regard to the following aims: - Atmospheric structure of mass-accreting stars, - Detection of mass-accreting regions and gas streams, - Secular variability of accretion, - CNO abundance analysis in the context of the evolutionary status of Algols.|Y
IBHMP|Eclipses of Interacting Binaries: An IUE/Voyager Project|Mirek J.|Plavec|UCLA|We propose to study circumstellar accretion structures in non-degenerate interacting binaries by combining IUE and Voyager observations as follows: (1) Combining high-dispersiori IUE spectra with Voyager scans of alpha Lyrae at its two eclipses and an additional phase. This will determine the flux distributions of both components between 900 and 3200 A. Repeating the same simultaneous observations 3 months later will help us ascertain the suspected variability of the disk-like secondary component.  (2) Combining again the IUE and Voyager observations, we will attempt to determine the duration of the total eclipse of Mu Sagittarii and decide if its is preceded by an atmospheric eclipse. The atmospheric eclipse would be very important for studying the extended atmosphere of the B8 Ia supergiant.  (3) Combining simultaneous IUE and Voyager observations, we propose to determine the spectral type of the hotter component of KX Andromedae and decide if the star or its envelope are variable.  (4) Running low-dispersion IUE observations through suitable eclipse phases, we propose to study the size and physical characteristics of the circumstellar accretion structures in the W Serpentis stars SX Cas, RX Cas, and W Crucis.  (5) By means of similar runs through eclipses, determine the physical characteristics of the circumstellar structures in the Algol binaries TT Hya, RS Cep, V356 Sgr, RW Per, and S Cnc or RY Per.  Six carefully selected US2 shifts can cover 12 different eclipses of 11 stars; some of these eclipses are otherwise rarely observable.|Y
IBHRP|500-3000 A Flux Distributions of Nova-Like Variables|Ronald S.|Polidan|Arizona|We propose to obtain simultaneous IUE and Vogager observations (500-3000 A) of the three nova-like variables V3885 Sgr, CPD -48 1577, and RW Sex, in order to study their flux distributions and line spectra. These data will be used to explore the inner disk/boundary layer region in these stars. V3885 Sgr- has a reported very soft Xray spectrum suggesting a very low hydrogen column density and, hence, a high probability of observing this star down to 500 A. The low sensitivity of Voyager for lamba > 1200 A does not enable adequate modeling of the continuum in these stars unless it is combined with IUE. The two spacecraft combined will give the most extensive wavelength coverage of these objects to date and provide an important test of accretion disk models. A comparison of the flux distributions of these stars with those of dwarf novae in outburst will also be made.|Y
IBHSK|UV Spectra of Symbiotic Stars Detected by the VLA|Scott J.|Kenyon|CFA|We wish to secure ultraviolet spectra over the course of an orbital cycle (2-3 years) for five symbiotic stars recently detected by the VLA. These spectra will be combined with contemporaneous optical, infrared and radio data to measure the flux distributions of these systems as a function of binary phase. The data-set will be analyzed using theoretical models developed by the authors to determine (i) the physical nature of the hot source of ionizing radiation, (ii) the physical conditions in the ionized nebula, and (iii) the binary separation for a small, but representative, sample of symbiotic stars.|Y
IBIAL|Spectrophotometric Synthesis Study of MR Cygni|Albert P.|Linnell|Michigan|A collaborative effort will obtain IUE and Voyager observations (900-3000 A), and ground-based UBVRI observations of MR Cygni. A new light synthesis program will provide synthesized continuous spectra at orbital phase of observation. Convolution of the synthesized spectra with filter pass bands will produce predicted UBVRI data for comparison with high speed ground-based photometry.  MR Cygni, a close (but not contact) B3 + B8 binary provides an appropriate benchmark test case for initial application of the new technique. Future studies will apply the technique to early-type contact and near-contact binary systems.  Existing light synthesis programs typically represent the continuous spectrum by a black body approximation. This crude representation is believed to be an important contributor to frequent failure to represent multi-wavelength light curves with a single set of parameters. Second, ground-based broad-band photometry does not reach the peak of the radiation curve of early spectral type systems. By resolving both problems, it should be possible to effect a major improvement in our knowledge concerning earlytype close binary systems.|Y
IBIFW|Detailed Study of the UZ Librae System at UV and Optical Wavelengths|Fredrick|Walter|University of Colorado|The FK Comae star UZ Librae is a close binary. Recent IUE spectra indicate the presence of a hot (17000K), faint continuum, which may indicate the presence of a hot companion in the system. If so, UZ Lib may be less evolved than FK Com, and further investigation of this system may well lead to an understanding of the evolutionary status of the FK Comae stars. We propose to obtain 16h SWP-LO spectra at phases 0 and 0.5 to study this hot companion, and to study the atmospheric structure of the K giant and look for structural differences between the dark and bright hemisphere. We also propose to obtain deep LWP-HI spectra over a 4 day period to doppler-image the chromosphere of the K giant.|Y
IBIJE|Interacting Binaries that are Just Beginning to Initiate Mass Transfer: Future Observations|Joel|Eaton|Indiana University|Observations are proposed for studying the interaction between a main-sequence star and its giant companion's wind in three long-period binaries. Well exposed high-dispersion spectra obtained at phases 0.86, 0.25, 0.4, and 0.5 will be used to relate optical depth-wavelength profiles of wind signatures to a density-position profile for the wind. Mg II P-Cyg features are expected to be used at all four phases; Fe II, near phase 0.5. Low dispersion spectra for the analogous binary system UU Cnc will be used to determine the nature of its secondary component and allow a solution of its light curve. Low-dispersion spectra of the secondary target AL Vel (near phase 0.9) will be used to search for wind absorptions in this star suspected of having atmospheric eclipses.|Y
IBIRW|Uniform Modelling of IUE Data for Cataclysmic Variables|Richard A.|Wade|Arizona|Understanding close binary star evolution relies on knowledge of the rate at which mass and angular momentum are transferred between the member stars or lost from the system. For semi-detached binaries containing a main-sequence star and a white dwarf (cataclysmic variables), the mass transfer rate dM/dt is more easily measured than dJ/dt. But accurate measurement of dM/dt requires that good models of the accretion disk spectrum be used, and statistical studies require that the data be analyzed uniformly.  This proposal addresses both of these issues, by reanalyzing in a uniform way IUE archival data for a group of cataclysmic variables with orbital periods longer than 6 hours. The aims of the study are to (1) test how well the observations are matched by current disk models and (2) if possible, find an ordering of the stars on some combination of physical parameters, such as the maximum disk temperature. The results will be compared with the results of a similar study of shorter-period cataclysmic variables now underway.|Y
IBJBB|Interacting F + BE Binaries|Bernard W.|Bopp|Toledo|Several binary star systems containing an F giant or bright giant and a Be component, all showing strong H-alpha emission, are to be observed at middle or far ultraviolet wavelengths at several orbital phases each. Previous IUE observations of some of these systems showed strong, variable Mg II emission; in at least one system (HD 207739) the UV spectrum showed flux changes of at least a factor of two and a change in nature from a complex absorption line spectrum similar to the interacting binary SX Cas to a more conventional hot star plus mild wind. Unfortunately, the IUE data were mostly obtained before orbital periods were derived for the systems, and the phase coverage of the UV observations is poor. We have now determined complete orbital parameters for four of these F + Be systems through groundbased spectroscopy. The optical data show dramatic phase-related variations in H-alpha intensity and profile, and emphasize the need for UV spectroscopy with adequate phase distribution to permit us to disentangle periodic from stochastic variations. We want ultimately to understand the evolutionary status of these objects and learn to what extent these binaries are related to or differ from the "W Serpentis" binary systems containing hot plasma.|Y
IBJBH|Ultraviolet Observations of the Unique Contact Binary VZ Piscium|Bruce J.|Hrivnak|Valparaiso|VZ Pso is a unique W UMa binary in that it possesses a mass ratio near unity (0.96). This suggests that it only recently evolved into contact, and thus it represents a rare, transient phase in the evolution of contact binaries. We propose to observe this system with IUE with the following two primary objectives. First, we plan to study the phase variation in the chromospheric emission by monitoring the MgII emission, as a test of the starspot model for the intrinsic light curve variation. Second, we plan to investigate the period-activity relation in this unique, short-period binary by measuring the high-excitation transition region emission with the SWP camera, which can then be compared with other cool contact systems and short-period detached systems. These spacecraft observations will be supported by ground-based photometry and spectroscopy.|Y
IBJDW|Coordinated UV/Optical Observations of IBWD Stars|Donald E.|Winget|Texas|We propose to measure as a function of magnitude the short-wavelength ultraviolet energy distributions of the two known interacting binary white dwarf outburst systems-PG 1346+082 and V803 Cen simultaneously with global, ground-based, time-series photometry and spectroscopy. The analysis of these data have a potential payback which is threefold: (i) Because the accretion flow is relatively-simple in these systems (helium with trace metals), realistic theoretical models may be possible. Through an observational and theoretical understanding of these simple systems, the more-general accretion-disk problem may be attacked. (ii) The characteristic temperatures of these systems vary and pass through the instability strip for helium-atmosphere white dwarfs. The shorttimescale photometric behavior and temperatures determined with the help of model atmosphere techniques may allow us to map the extent and boundaries of the instability strip to unprecedented accuracy, (iii) The secondaries of these systems are the H-exhausted, Herich degenerate cores of old stars. Thus, we are observing core- processed material brought to light in the accretion flow, which should aid in our understanding of quiescent (non-explosive) nucleosynthesis processes in stellar interiors.|Y
IBJJE|Interacting Binaries Containing Cool Giants|Jeol A.|Eaton|Indiana University|Observations are proposed for studying the interaction between a main-sequence star and its giant companion's wind in two long-period binaries. Low dispersion spectra for UU Cnc (K4 III + ?) will be used to determine the nature of its secondary component, to allow a solution of its light curve, and to study absorption of light in its chromosphere. High-dispersion LWP spectra of AL Vel, obtained at phases of the eclipse of the B8 star by the chromosphere of the KO giant, will be used to relate strengths, velocities, equivalent widths, and shapes of chromospheric absorption lines to properties of the chromospheric gas.|Y
IBKJN|The Intrinsic H I Lyman Alpha Profiles of Ty Pyxis|James E.|Neff|Colorado - JILA|IWe will obtain high-resolution spectra of the Ly-alpha (1216 A) emission line of the closebinary system TY Pyxis (G5-7 V + G4-5 V; Period=3.2 days) at opposite orbital quadratures. The combined systemic and orbital velocity produces a radial velocity difference between the center of the stellar emission and the center of the interstellar absorption of +142 km s^-1. Thus the core of the emission line from the star at maximum redshift (~0.7 A) will be effectively removed from the interstellar H I and D I absorption. By observing at both quadratures, we will measure accurately the intrinsic profiles of both stars in this system.  We will first use these profiles to compare the intrinsic Ly-alpha flux of the two stars in TY Pyx with the fluxes of other chromospheric and transition region lines. The intrinsic emission profiles will subsequently be used to derive, with lower precision, stellar Ly-alpha emission fluxes of other stars of similar spectral type using low-resolution spectra from the archives.|Y
IBLEG|Stalking the Migrating Spots, Plages, and Transition-Regions on VW Cephei|Edward F.|Guinan|Villanova|During 1987 and 1988 we have been conducting a coordinated effort of ground-based photometry and UV spectroscopy of the bright W UMa contact binary VW Cephei. The photometry has indicated the presence of large, cool starspot regions on the larger, cooler star of the system. PM observations were conducted to search for possible phase dependent variations of the strong chromospheric and transition region emission lines that could correlate with die location and extent of the starspots deduced from the light curves. From these data we found strong but not conclusive evidence to support the physical and geometrical connection between the photospheric starspots and the overlying transition region emission. This uncertainty results chiefly from the limited phase coverage so far achieved because of the relatively long exposure times needed for the SWP spectra (70-80 minutes) and the short period of the system.  We are proposing to observe VW Cep with the IUE over two consecutive days (2 US I and 2 US2 shifts) to secure a more detailed and accurate mapping of the surface activity. This would allow us to obtain SWP and LWP spectra with nearly double the phase resolution previously achieved. In addition, high dispersion LWP spectra will be taken at the quadratures of the orbit when the radial velocity separation of the two stars is greatest. This permits the Mg II h + k emission line profiles of each star to be resolved and the level of chromospheric emission to be determined for each component as well as examining the line profiles for the spectroscopic signatures of winds and possible mass flows.  Recent photometry (November/December 1988) indicates that the system is heavily spotted and thus it is a tremendous opportunity (and maybe one of the last with IUE) to study this important star in an active state. The proposed observations along with continuing ground-based photometry are important in order to extend the coverage of VW Cep for an additional year to monitor the possible 8-9 year activity cycle. VW Cep represents an extreme case for studying stellar dynamo theory and the proposed IUE observations can play a crucial role in the understanding of magnetic fields and activity cycles in rapidly rotating solar-like stars.|Y
IBLGP|The Gas Stream in the Algol Binaries TT Hydrae and V393 Scorpii|Geraldine J.|Peters|USC|Phase-resolved, high resolution IUE observations are proposed for the Algol binaries TT Hya and V393 Sco to determine their current rates of mass transfer. Both systems show H-alpha-emitting accretion disks that appear to extend out to the limit of the primary's Roche surface. A single high resolution image of TT Hya at 0 - 0.89 revealed only modest gas stream absorption even though, according to the models of Lubow and Shu (1975), the gas stream should have been most visible at this phase. The inferred rate of mass transfer from this observation is 4-6 orders of magnitude below the canonical value for Algols. This project is designed to test the idea that the gas stream in TT Hya is diverted both in azimuth and latitude by the star's extended accretion disk. I will look for 1) infall of material at earlier phases in TT Hya than predicted by Lubow and Shu, 2) evidence that much of the mass flow occurs outside of the orbital plane (by obtaining similar observations of V393 Sco, a partially eclipsing system with similar systemic parameters to TT Hya, and comparing the mass flow in both stars with that seen in archival IUE data on the non-eclipsing system CX Dra), and 3) the possibility that a substantial amount of material in the gas stream actually leaves the system at 0 - 0.5, as the H-alpha data suggest.|Y
IBLJE|Long-Term Observations of 31 Cygni|Joel A.|Eaton|Indiana University|Thirty-one Cygni is perhaps the most important of the zeta Aur binaries in that it has the greatest separation, cleanest eclipse, best determined orbit, and best existing combination of ground-based plus IUE data. Its next total eclipse will be centered in March 1993. In preparation for this unique event, I am proposing observations to monitor its spectrum far from eclipse and to try to detect the first whiffs of the upper chromosphere in early 1992. These will determine mostly the state of the wind in directions toward the hot component of the system.|Y
IBLJS|V1010 Ophiuchi|J. Scott|Shaw|Georgia|V1010 Ophiuchi (P = o^d.661; A7 V-IV + G2V) is the brightest member of a small group of short period (p<l^d) binaries with A to F primaries and G to M secondaries in which the components are very close but not in contact. These stars are of particular astrophysical interest because they are very closely related both physically and evolutionarily to A-type W UMa systems. They may be in the early stages of mass transfer which will result in their eventually becoming contact systems, Alternately, they could become W UMa systems which have previously been in contact and now have temporarily become detached from their Roche lobes.  We propose to observe V1010 Oph with the SWP camera at high dispersion at the quadratures of the orbit in order to determine the masses of the components from their radial velocities. We will measure the radial velocity of the cooler star by using its relatively strong Lyman a emission feature which was discovered in a previous study. It is possible to measure the cool star's Lyman a feature with the IUE because the A7 star contributes virtually no flux in this spectral region. Moreover, because of the short period of the binary the stellar Lyman a feature is doppler shifted away from the strong but narrow geocoronal feature. This permits the radial velocity and integrated flux of the stellar Lyman a feature to be easily measured in high dispersion with the SWP camera, making the IUE uniquely suitable in carrying out this experiment.  Also, we will observe with the LWP camera at high dispersion and the SWP camera at high and low dispersions over an entire orbit to locate (a) mass flow in the binary system, (b) gas stream impact regions, and (c) the level of chromospheric activity and its possible variations over the surface of the cooler component. The IUE observations will be supported by ground-based photometry to be made at the University of Georgia and Villanova University.|Y

IBLRP|Accretion Driven Outflows in the Interacting Binary V356 Sagittarii|Ronald S.|Polidan|Arizona|It is proposed that a series of high dispersion SWP and LWP images be obtained of the binary star V356 Sgr outside of the system's primary eclipse. These observations will be used to study the accretion driven outflow seen in the spectrum of the B3 primary star. IUE high dispersion observations of this binary during primary eclipse showed the presence of strong, exceedingly broad (FWHM ~ 1000 km s^-1) high ionization emission lines. No carbon lines (C II, III, of IV) are seen in the emission spectrum. Line profile analyses of the Si III 1206 line, and the N V 1240, and Si IV 1400 doublets has shown that these lines are formed in a single extended region that may contain clumps The most probable origin of this gas is an accretion driven wind from the B star of matter transferred from the CNO processed (carbon deficient) surface layers of the A2II companion. The proposed observations will be used to determine the geometrical and physical properties of the accretion driven outflow and compare the results derived for the flow with those obtained from the emission line study. The combined "wind" and emission line results will be used to test existing models for accretion driven winds.|Y
IBMBB|UV Observations of Interacting F + B(E) Binary Star Systems|Bernard W.|Bopp|U Toledo|The unusual binary system HD 207739 [F8 II + B(e)pp] is a remarkable object that shows Ha, Mg II, and [N II] emission; ellipsoidal light variations; variable UVexcess; and erratic UV line variability. As a class, HD 207739 and other F + B(e) variables are in an evolutionary stage where mass is being transferred from a yellow giant or supergiant star to a hot dwarf star with a substantial accretion disk and circumsystem material. Prior IUE investigations of these systems have shown extreme spectral changes that appear to be a mix of periodic and stochastic variations. However, the older data are not well distributed in phase to enable us to disentangle periodic changes on the orbital time-scale (141 days) from random (?) episodes of mass transfer. Now that we have determined a precise spectroscopic orbit, we propose to obtain a series of UV observations spaced about 0.1 in orbital phase, to follow the spectral variability of HD 207739 and one or two other F + B(e) systems over a single orbit. This will determine the nature/extent of any periodic spectral variability and allow a consistent interpretation of the earlier UV data, which was obtained over a base-line of over 20 orbital cycles and thus is more suited to an investigation of long-term spectral variability. The IUE observations will be coordinated with groundbased optical photometry and spectroscopy.|Y
IBMGP|Mass and Angular Momentum Loss in the Interacting Binary Au monocerotis|Geraldine J.|Peters|USC|AU Monocerotis is an Algol type binary system that displays permanent double peaked H-alpha emission, a high temperature plasma on its trailing hemisphere, and an interesting periodic long-term (411^d) variation of O^m.3 in its optical light, IUE observations during the past year and ones obtained in 1984 confirm that the mass transfer rate is largest when the star is faint, but the high temperature plasma is more prominent when the star is bright. Furthermore, the accretion disk in the system appears to be more dense when the star is faint. Archival IUE data also reveal that mass loss from the system is variable over the long-term cycle. The mass and angular momentum loss from Algol systems, important for theoretical modelling of their evolution, remains one of the least known parameters and sporadic IUE observations of a few Algols suggest that it varies considerably and may depend on the rate of mass transfer. This system gives us a unique opportunity to study the variation in mass loss in an Algol binary as a function of mass transfer in a predictable way. High and low resolution IUE observations with a phase resolution of OP1 are proposed for extreme phases in its long-term light (and mass transfer) cycle to investigate the effect of the variable mass transfer in this system on the systemic mass loss. Considering the phases in the long-term light cycle and constraints on spacecraft pointing the next possible times to carry through this program would be 1990 December and 1991 September. Therefore I request that the program extend over a two year period.|Y

These will determine mostly the state of the wind in directions toward the hot component of the system.|Y
IBMRP|CNO Processing in Massive Algol Binaries|Ronald S.|Polidan|NASA/GSFC|We propose to search for abundance anomalies indicative of CNO processing in six (6) massive interacting binary systems using low dispersion SWP exposures obtained during primary eclipse. Specifically, we will look for evidence of carbon depletion in the circumstellar matter in the binary system using the C IV 1550 doublet and in the photospheric layers of the A-spectral type mass losing component in the binary using the strong UV C I lines near 1657 A (multiplet 2). The stars for this study were selected from a recently completed optical survey of over 100 Algol systems as the best candidates for showing evidence of CNO processing. These data will be used to provide carbon depletion estimates to constrain models for mass transfer and for comparison with the chemical evolution predictions of stellar interior calculations.|Y
IBMRW|Characterization of Three Short-Period Binary Stars Using IUE|Richard A.|Wade|KPNO|We propose to obtain low-dispersion SWP and LWP spectra of three short-period binaries from the Palomar-Green catalogue. One of these, PG 0027+260, is a cataclysmic variable which cannot be classified on the basis of puzzling optical data; the other systems, PG 1550+131 and PG 1633+115, are pre-cataclysmic binaries. The IUE spectra will clarify the nature of PG 0027+260 and will provide the basis for accurate temperature and flux estimates for the other stars, essential for light-curve analysis, system age estimates, and disentangling their composite optical spectra.|Y

IBNRP|Pseudo-Luminous Stars in Binary Systems|Ronald S.|Polidan|NASA/GSFC|Ground based observations of Algol binaries have identified two shorter period binary systems, GG Cas and V342 Aql, that spectroscopically appear to contain luminous stars. Simple analysis shows that such luminous objects cannot possibly exist in these binary systems. These "pseudo-luminous" objects are the target of this. investigation. GG Cas is shown to be either a freak optical alignment of a G-giant and an early type Algol system or a rather interesting sdB+G binary system. IUE observations of this system will resolve the uncertainties regarding the nature of the B-component in this system. V342 Aql appears to be either the shortest period W Ser system discovered (by a factor of -3) or an unprecedentedly active Algol binary. IUE observations are proposed that would identify this system as a W Ser star or perform the first study of mass transfer activity in this unique system.|Y

ICJDY|Edges of Clouds|Donald G.|York|Chicago|The study of nearby interstellar clouds provides a convenient means of testing models of the interstellar medium. The current model of the ISM postulates cold clouds embedded In a hot gas from supernova remnants with a warm evaporating interface between them. This interface is important in the dynamics of the interstellar medium. To date very few studies have focused on the composition and structure of these regions. We propose to sample a recently discovered nearby cloud in the resonance lines of highly ionized species in order to understand the edges of clouds and the interface region. Because the cloud is nearby we are able to study a number of stars at various distances from the cloud center and therefore to sample the interface region at many locations.

ICJHB|Investigation of Interstellar Carbon|J. H.|Black|Harvard-CFA|Objective: Carbon has a spectrum rich in far ultraviolet lines arising from the ground states of all its first four stages of ionization. This fact coupled with its relatively high cosmic abundances and its potential detectability at medium and far infrared frequencies make it an ideal element for probing the excitation and ionization of varioud parts of the interstellar medium.|Y
ICJJH|Ultraviolet Extinction and Infrared Cirrus|John A.|Hackwell|Aerospace Corporation|We propose to study the correlation between high galactic latitude infrared (100 micron) "cirrus" emission and ultraviolet extinction. Modelling of the "cirrus" emission by Draine and Anderson strongly suggests that the size distribution of the infrared emitting particles is enhanced in small particles; these small particles are an important contributor to the ultraviolet extinction. The 100 micron intensity and the ratio of the 60 to 100 micron intensity also carries information about the dust. Therefore, a comparison of the infrared and ultraviolet measurements will tell us much about the interstellar material that produces the pervasive infrared "cirrus" emission. To avoid confusing effects being introduced into the study by program stars being at different distances with respect to the infrared emitting clouds, we have carefully selected two high-latitude galactic clusters (IC 4665 and NGC 1647) for the study. We will use the methods developed by Fitzpatrick and Massa to study ultraviolet extinction variations between individual stars in each cluster and to study variations between the clusters.|Y
ICKAD|CO Clouds in the Local Interstellar Medium|Andrea K.|Dupree|CFA SAO|A new component of the local interstellar medium - nearby molecular clouds has recently been discovered through sensitive millimeter-wave observations of CO. These clouds at approximately 100 pc from the Sun may be associated with the IR cirrus revealed by IRAS, and also with low mass star formation regions. The latter characteristic implies that these CO clouds harbor the nearest regions of star formation.  We propose to obtain high resolution ultraviolet spectra of warm stars behind and surrounding several clouds in order to specify conditions within the clouds, to search for evaporative cloud boundaries, and to define their distances more precisely.|Y

ICPDW|UV Studies of Translucent Interstellar Clouds|Daniel E.|Welty|U Chicago|Translucent interstellar clouds, characterized by visual extinctions 2.0 < A(v) < 10.0, occupy the transitional regime between the well studied, photochemistry dominated diffuse clouds and the gas phase chemistry dominated dense clouds. As such, they provide opportunities for further exploring correlations between farUV extinction characteristics and molecular abundances noted for the diffuse clouds, but under conditions where the photoprocesses are of reduced importance. I propose to determine accurate UV extinction curves for 20 highly reddened stars [E(B-V) > 0.7, A(v) > 2.0] for which optical molecular absorption-line data have been obtained, in order to study the effects of extinction on the structure and composition of interstellar clouds, the grain scattering characteristics in the far-UV, and the generally poorly known (but quite important) ambient far-UV radiation field in the cloud cores.  Since molecular abundances are predicted to be significantly higher in these denser, thicker clouds than in the diffuse clouds, I also propose to obtain high-dispersion long-wavelength spectra of six stars, characterized by a range in far-UV extinction, to search for absorption due to CS, OH, SO, and several other molecules. Achievable detection limits of  5-10 mA will provide significant tests for current models of the sulfur chemistry, set limits on the importance of certain grain surface reactions, and constrain the far-UV radiation field in the translucent clouds.|Y

IDHTS|Interstellar Depletions in Diffuse Cloud Cores|Theodore P.|Snow|University of Colorado|We propose to determine whether depletions of interstellar elements are enhanced in high-density regions in diffuse clouds. Our technique is to derive cloud core depletions from relative column densities of neutral atomic species, which exist only in the densest regions along a given line of sight. Comparison of these cloud-core depletions with those derived separately from observations of singly-ionized species will therefore tell us whether enhanced depletion occurs where the density is high. In order to measure weak lines of Fe I and Si I, we will use a special technique for reducing noise in IUE images, requiring multiple exposures of each target star.|Y
IDIJC|Characteristics of 2175 a Extinction|Jason A.|Cardelli|Wisconsin|We propose to observe a number of lines of sight which appear to exhibit unusually weak 2175 A feature strengths as determined from ANS extinction excesses. Recent work has indicated that the width of the feature (fwhm; gamma) varies while the central position (lambda0) appears to stay fixed. These results suggest that if the feature is caused by graphite grains, they are very small (a < 50 A).  The broadest observed features appear to be associated with dense, quiescent regions and are also largely represented by relative feature strengths that are weaker than average. We therefore feel that examining lines of sight with extremely weak feature strengths may lead to more extreme limits on gamma and lambda 0 Such results would certainly lead to tighter restrictions on the origin of the feature and seriously test the recent theoretical premise that the feature is the result of extinction by hydrogen-free carbon grains of the order a < 50 A.|Y
IDKEB|Variable Bump Extinction in NGC6530|Erika|Bohm-Vitense|Washington|We have found that the area and width of the 2200 A ultraviolet extinction bump varies dramatically from star to star within the young cluster NGC 6530. The bump is strongest toward stars in the center of the cluster and systematically weakens with distance from center appearing to reach an asymptotic state. Because the highest temperature stars in our sample are generally farther from the center this may also mean that the extinction bump is dependent on stellar temperature.  It is very unfortunate that five stars whose positions and/or temperatures make them well suited for separating the effects of distance and temperature have only low quality long wavelength spectra. We want to reobserve those stars and obtain spectra of new targets advantageously located within the cluster to study whether the extinction is dependent on distance from the center or on stellar temperature.|Y
IDKJC|Characteristics of Weak 2175 a Extinction|Jason A.|Cardelli|Wisconsin|We propose to observe a number of lines of sight which appear to exhibit unusually weak 2175 A feature strengths as determined from ANS extinction excesses, Recent work has indicated that the width of the feature (fwhm; gamma) varies while the central position (lambda 0) appears to stay relatively fixed. These results suggest that if the feature is caused by graphite grains, they are very small (a < 50 A).  In general, the broadest observed features appear to be associated with dense, quiescent regions and are also largely represented by relative feature strengths that are weaker than average. We therefore feel that examining lines of sight with extremely weak feature strengths may lead to more extreme limits on y and lambda 0. Such results would certainly lead to tighter restrictions on the origin of the feature and seriously test the recent theoretical promise that the feature is the result of extinction by hydrogen-free carbon grains of the order a < 50 A.  These studies may reveal lines of sight having extreme physical conditions which are ideally suited for studying dust-gas phase interactions and interstellar molecular processes.  Such processes are fundamental to both the evolution of the interstellar medium and star formation.|Y
IDKWL|Deuterium Observations Toward Early-Type Stars|Wayne|Landsman|ST Systems Corporation|The deuterium to hydrogen abundance ratio (D/H) is one of the few observational parameters in cosmology, and a key constraint on the baryon density of the universe. The best determination. of D/H in the interstellar medium, has come using Copernicus observations toward early type stars, by detecting absorption In the higher Lyman lines. Unfortunately, only the Lyman Alpha line will be accessible to the High Resolution Spectrograph (HRS) on Space Telescope, and deuterium Lyman Alpha absorption has never been observed toward an early type star. It has been generally believed that only late-type stars were sufficiently nearby, so that absorption from HI Lyman-alpha did not saturate the interstellar DI feature.  I propose to obtain IUE high-dispersion SWP spectra of two stars. Beta CMa (Bl II-II, d=200 pc), Eps CMa (B2 II, d=170 pc), located in a direction of the sky with an exceptionally low interstellar HI column density. Archival IUE spectra of these stars are very underexposed at Lyman Alpha, but do suggest that deuterium Lyman Alpha measurements are, in fact, possible toward these stars. I propose to take much deeper exposures than currently exist, and to coadd the spectra in a manner that avoids fixed pattern noise.  The continuum of an early-type star has several advantages over a. chromospheric Lyman-alpha emission line as a probe of interstellar deuterium. The hot-star continuum is much brighter, less likely to have intrinsic structure, and suitable for observing many other species as a diagnostic of the interstellar gas. Should this program demonstrate the feasibility of Lyman-alpha deuterium measurements toward these hot stars, then follow-up observations with HRS might plausibly yield the most precise value of D/H in the interstellar medium.|Y

IEBTS|Studies of Structure in the Ultraviolet Interstellar Extinction Law with the IUE|Theodore P.|Snow|Colorado|It is proposed to use IUE in a study of structure in the ultraviolet extinction curve. IUE is capable of substantially improving upon earlier attempts to do this, because more heavily-reddened stars can be observed with adequate spectral resolution than was possible with earlier instruments. Both resolution modes will be used in a search for ultraviolet features comparable to the visible-wavelength diffuse interstellar bands. The presence or absence of such features will provide valuable information on the nature of interstellar grains, will provide constraints on the carriers of the visible-wavelength bands, or will yield new data on interstellar molecular processes. Matched pairs of reddened and unreddened stars will be observed and the spectra compared in order to reveal possible structure in the extinction curve. Two allotments of eight shifts each are requested, to be separated by one year, so that first the short-wavelength region of the spectrum, and later the long-wavelength region, can be studied for the same stars. The best candidate stars for this study are available in the spring.|Y
IECBS|A Search for Variable UV Extinction in Hot Stars with Circumstellar Dust Shells|Blair D.|Savage|Wisconsin|We propose to observe  5 hot stars with circumstellar dust shells with IUE.

We propose to monitor the changes in the UV flux distributions those stars. The new data when combined with existing data will provide a data base extending over ~ 2 1/2 years. Measured changes in the UV flux distributions will yield valuable information about the composition and size distribution of the circumstellar particles.|Y

IEEGC|The Nature of Dust in the LMC|Geoffrey C.|Clayton|Toronto|This is a proposal to obtain short and long wavelength, low dispersion IUE spectra of several polarized supergiants in the LMC. It is part of an extensive study of dust in that galaxy. UBVRI photometry, linear polarimetry, JHK photometry and low resolution IUE spectra are being obtained for a sample of approximately 45 stars. An analysis of this data will reveal the characteristics of the extinction over a wavelength range of 0.1 to 2.2 microns. The wavelength dependence of the extinction and the polarization will be compared to computer scattering models. The stars in this sample were chosen to include as many stars as possible for which IUE spectra already exist. However, the subset of the sample containing 18 stars with polarizations greater than 1% is not well represented as only 5 have previously observed with the IUE. Therefore, this proposal is to observe an additional 6 polarized stars to give a more complete sample both in number and in spatial coverage across the LMC.|Y
IEETS|Observations of Grains in the Interstellar Medium|Theodore P.|Snow|Colorado|A continuation and extension of ongoing work on ultraviolet extinction curves is proposed. This phase of the study will concentrate on anomalous extinction curves in interstellar clouds. Previous studies have shown that possibly half or more of the diffuse interstellar clouds exhibit anomalous extinction. It is difficult to say why some clouds have anomalous extinction and some do not. It is very important to understand the nature of the grain population in interstellar clouds, not only to further the understanding of the clouds themselves, but also because the assumed extinction properties of the grains affect the interpretation of data from a wide variety of objects, ranging from proto-stars to Herbig-Haro objects to galaxies and quasars. This study will try to better define the nature and occurrence of grain anomalies.|Y
IEFAC|A Study of Reddening in Galactic Symbiotic Stars|Authur D.|Code|Wisconsin|We propose to undertake a systematic and diverse program of studying reddening in galactic symbiotic stars, using the extensive IUE database of low resolution IUE spectra. We will use both the 2200 A feature and measurements of the HeII (1640 A) emission line to derive estimates of E(B-V) and compare these results with the reddening indicated by the reddening-distance diagrams, where available, for the surrounding fields. Such estimates are crucial for the eventual interpretation and understanding of the ultraviolet energy distributions of symbiotic stars.|Y
IEFBS|A Study of Extinction in the Large Magellanic Cloud|Blair D.|Savage|Wisconsin|Seven IUE shifts are requested to observe 40 early-type LMC supergiants to better define the ultraviolet properties of LMC extinction, and to search for regional variability. Past studies have been severely handicapped by a lack of suitable flux standards to compare with the reddened stars. The resultant extinction curves are influenced by stellar mismatch errors. Thirty very lightly reddened standard stars have been chosen to span a wide range in luminosity and temperature. These will be combined with a large body of existing reddened star data and ten additional targets to produce high quality LMC extinction curves. Determination of the dust composition, size, etc. in the LMC and the intrinsic energy distributions of LMC stars requires that the properties of the extinction law be accurately determined.|Y
IEGAW|Far-UV Extinction and the Size Distribution of Interstellar Grains|Adolf N.|Witt|Toledo|We are proposing to determine the UV extinction curves for early-type stars embedded in dense interstellar clouds, which appear as bright reflection nebulae as a result of their association with the respective stars. The purpose of this program is to derive information concerning the size distributions of grains prevailing in these individual clouds. The data obtained from this program will be related to results derived from a parallel groundbased observing program directed at measuring the relative intensity of extended red/near-IR emission (ERE) emission (Sellgren, Werner, and Dinerstein 1983) in the same nebulae. The recently discovered ERE has been interpreted as being due to thermal radiation produced in temperature fluctuations of micrograins (10^-7 cm size), a hypothesized grain population intermediate in size between interstellar molecules and ordinary grains. It is our aim to determine whether relationships exist between the relative intensity of ERE and the steepness of the far-UV extinction rise in these nebulae, which would strengthen the interpretation of both phenomena in terms of a wide, continuous size distribution of very small grains in the 10^-610^-7 cm range.  An additional benefit of our study would be new information on the range of variation of extinction curves attributable to individual clouds.|Y
IEGBS|A Study of the Nature of Dust in the Open Cluster Trumpler 37|Blair D.|Savage|Wisconsin|This is a proposal to probe the nature of dust in the open cluster Trumpler 37. One cluster member, HD 204827, has been found to possess an extremely anomalous ultraviolet extinction curve which resembles the average LMC extinction. The fact that this star is a member of a cluster provides a valuable opportunity to study other dust lying at the same distance along nearby lines of sight. The observing sample contains stars which will allow the dust to be mapped in 3 dimensions to look for spatial variations in the extinction characteristics.|Y
IEGCG|Interstellar Reddening in the Small Magellanic Cloud|Catharine D.|Garmany|Colorado|It has become increasingly evident since the launch of IUE that there is no such thing as a mean galactic extinction low in the ultraviolet. This has important implications, both for attempts to derive unreddened stellar continua by an application of an average extinction low, and for models of the dust composition, size, and dynamical history of the interstellar medium. It is also possible to study the UV extinction in nearby galaxies and contrast it with our own. In the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), the "average" curve in the UV is higher, and in the SMC it is still higher. In addition, the curves derived in different studies show an enormous range in strengths. We propose to study the extinction in the SMC by pairing reddened and unreddened stars of similar spectral type. These stars have been identified from classification slit spectra we are taking as part of a separate observing program. We plan to combine IUE data with visual scanner data to derive an extinction curve over a long baseline. This will enable us to determine if a mean extinction low exists in the SMC and if some of the variation in derived laws is due to spectral mismatch. If a variety of UV extinction properties are found, then we will examine regional effects. The SMC is a key galaxy because of its low chemical abundance, and it is important to explore the extinction from a study of normal early-type stars which are unlikely to suffer abnormal circumstellar absorption. It is this group of stars, not previously identified in the SMC, that we propose to observe.|Y
IEGCW|Hot Dust and the 3.3 Micron Feature: Are 10A Grains the Solution|Charles E.|Woodward|Rochester|The physical mechanism responsible for both the unidentified 3.28pm feature and the high (1000K) dust temperatures observed in many galactic infrared sources has long been problematic in infrared astronomy. Bimodal grain distributions have been invoked, with the small grains of radius a< 0.01 micron responsible for near infrared characteristics and the larger grains for far infrared characteristics. Recently, Sellgren (1983) has suggested that. thermally fluctuating grains with a~lOA could possibly explain both the high dust. temperatures and the 3.28micron feature emission. We propose to test her hypothesis that an extrapolation of the usual interstellar grain size distribution to small sizes provides the small grains. We plan to model fit grain size distributions to UV extinction curves (properly weighted to be sensitive to the small grain cutoff) of exciting or nearby stars associated with the HII region M8, and 2 reflection nebulae NGC7023 and NGC2023. This project will utilize both new observations and archival data obtained with the IUE.|Y
IEGEB|Interstellar Gas and Dust Absorptions Near NGC 6530|Erika|Bohm-Vitense|Washington|In our study of the extinction law for 0 and early B stars in the young galactic clusters NGC 6530 we found a rather strong dependence of extinction on T(eff) (see Fig. 1). Since the highest temperature stars are also farthest away from the center of the cluster (see Fig. 2) this may also mean that the extinction law changes with distance from the cluster center. We want to study which is the true correlation by studying stars with the same T(eff) but at different distances from the Cluster center.  We also want to study the interstellar gas, which is concentrated near the Cluster in order to see whether the gas properties change in a systematic way in accordance with the observed changes in the extinction law.|Y
IEGJS|Interstellar Studies with IUE Archives|J. Michael|Shull|Colorado-Lasp|We propose to use the large amount of IUE archive data on OB stars for continued studies in two areas: (1) interstellar abundances and (2) interstellar extinction curves. We will use the software and expertise at the University of Colorado Regional Data Analysis Facility. Last year, we analyzed ~150 lines of sight to derive column densities of H I, Si II, and Fe II, and we made statistical correlations of the depletions and gas content with E(B-V), spectral type, galactic longitude, and scale height above the disk. In the coming year we will study ~100 more lines of sight (out to 5 kpc) and extend our analysis to Ni, Mn, and Zn. These studies will be correlated with extinction curves determined from low-resolution IUE data.|Y
IEIEF|The Properties of Ultraviolet Extinction Curves|Edward L.|Fitzpatrick|Colorado - JILA|In this proposal we are requesting continued support of a quantitative investigation, using Archival IUE data, of the properties of ultraviolet extinction curves. We have recently completed a study of the 2175 A bump toward a large sample of reddened Milky Way OB stars. The results of this study place strong constraints on the possible origins of the bump. We plan to extend this investigation to other aspects of UV extinction curves, e.g. , the properties of the far-UV extinction rise and their relationship to the bump properties. The ultimate goal of this project is to provide a complete and quantitative description of the properties of UV extinction curves, which is required for an understanding of the nature of interstellar dust grains.|Y
IEJDM|Far UV Extinction and the 2175 Angstrom Bump|Derck L.|Massa|Applied Research Corp.|Work in progress suggests that the far Uv curvature observed in uv extinction curves may be related to the width of the 2175A bump. If verified, such a relationship would be strong evidence for a graphitic origin of the bump. This is because graphite particles are expected to have a second resonance in their optical properties near 80oA whose width broadens in step with the one at 2175A. Consequently, a relationship between the bump width and the FUV curvature would be expected because the FUV curvature would actually be the red wing of the widening 800A resonance protruding further into the accessable UV. more observations are needed of extinction curves with broad and narrow bumps in order to verify the observed trend. We describe how to identify such stars using available ANS photometry.|Y
IEJTS|Depletions in 2200 a Scattering Regions|Theodore P.|Snow|Colorado - CASA|We propose to obtain high-dispersion spectra of the star HD38087 (B5V; V 8.30, E(B-V) = 0.24) for the purpose of determining interstellar elemental abundances and depletions. The reason for our interest in this star is that it is embedded in a reflection nebula where the 2175A extinction feature has been observed in emission; this is one of only two such regions known. The presence of 2175A emission has been interpreted as due to scattering by grains, and the profile of the feature indicates that the grain population is dominated by large grains, significantly larger than the general interstellar grain population. It is therefore of interest to determine abundances and depletions, to see whether the unusual grain size distribution is the result of grain growth processes that might have resulted in unusual depletions, and to determine whether the grains in this region have any compositional peculiarities that might be associated with their 2175A scattering properties. The faintness of the star requires rather long exposures. Further, we will need at least three exposures (at different offsets in the large aperture) optimized for each of three different wavelength regions, so that averaging can be done to maximize data quality. Hence three U.S. 1 shifts are requested.|Y
IEKEB|Ultraviolet Extinction in the Outer Galaxy|Erika|Bohm-Vitense|Washington|We propose to test whether the empirical trend of increasing far-ultraviolet extinction and decreasing 2200 A bump strength with decreasing metallicity seen among the solar neighborhood, LMC, and SMC is also valid within the Milky Way. Recent re-examinations of the average extinction curve in the LMC suggest that the dependence may not be as strong as originally thought; stars outside of the atypical 30 Doradus region exhibit extinction remarkably similar to that of diffuse regions in the Milky Way.  To test the validity of the trend requires observations of the extinction in other systems of different metallicities. Long exposure IUE spectra of luminous stars in M31 and M33 have been used to estimate the extinction in these galaxies but the low flux levels and uncertainties of the true stellar intrinsic colors make the results susceptible to large errors.  To study extinction in systems of low metal content does not require observations of extragalactic stars, however. With the galactic abundance gradient, a metallicity comparable to that in the LMC is reached in only three or four kiloparsecs from the solar circle. We intend to measure the extinction curves toward several stars at this distance or beyond. The low nearby extinction toward much of the outer Galaxy ensures that the extinction of the stars is dominated by distant dust. The use of relatively bright and nearby stars will allow us to measure the extinction in an unexplored metal poor environment with unusually high precision.|Y
IEKGC|A Connection Between Visual and UV Extinction|Geoffrey C.|Clayton|Wisconsin|Cardelli and Clayton (1988) have discovered that RV, the ratio of total-to-selective extinction, and the linear background slope in the near-ultraviolet extinction, as defined by Fitzpatrick and Massa (1987), are strongly correlated. Lines of sight with large values of RV have shallow slopes in the near-ultraviolet, while normal values of RV show steep slopes. The relationship is not well determined for large RV where the sample has few stars. It is not clear whether the slope approaches zero asymptotically or whether it simply Teaches a maximum value of Rv. This proposal is for observations of three additional lines of sight with large values of RV (>4). All three lines of sight exist in young, active star forming regions and are characterized by IR-visual extinction which flattens out in the B and U-bands. This new relationship offers the prospect of separating out the extinction of one particular grain population, namely the silicates responsible for much of the visual extinction and polarization. Of particular importance, this relationship now establishes a direct observable connection between extinction in two completely different wavelength regions which allows extinction information on both wavelength regions to be discerned when observations exist for only one of them.|Y
IETOO|Supernovae Observered as Target of Opportunity| |misc| |Abstract unavailable|N
IGBAD|Interstellar Matter Near X-Ray Sources|A.|Dalgarno|Smithsonian|A galactic X-ray source can have profound effects upon the physical state of surrounding interstellar matter. In particular, atoms in very high stages of ionization will be produced in much larger amounts than would be the case in the normal interstellar medium. We have previously identified very strong interstellar C IV 1550 in the ultraviolet spectrum of the binary X-ray system 3U1700-37 and toward the star HD153246 which is at a projected distance of 16 pc from the source of X-rays. Proposed high-dispersion observations with IUE will survey a number of distant OB stars whose lines of sight pass within a few hundred parsecs of strong X-ray sources. Analysis of the ultraviolet interstellar absorption lines in these directions will permit us to determine the effects of X-rays upon interstellar matter and to map out the extent of the X-ray "sphere of influence" around a source.|Y
IGBAW|Determination of Interstellar Abundance by Correlated X-Ray and Ultraviolet Observations|A. B.|Walker|Stanford University|Ultraviolet observations of interstellar absorption lines obtained with Copernicus have provided important new insights into the structure and composition of the interstellar medium (ISM). These observations have also raised important questions about interstellar matter which are difficult to resolve by ultraviolet observations alone. These questions include: (1) What fraction of the interstellar abundance of the important elements (C, N,  O, Mg, Si, S, Ar, Fe) is bound in the interstellar grains?; (2) What is the absolute (i.e. relative to H) abundance of C, N, O, Mg, Si, S, Ar, Fe?; (3) What is the interstellar abundance of Ne?; (4) What is the ionization structure of the interstellar gas?; (5) What is the composition and size of the interstellar grains? X-ray photoabsorption in the interstellar medium introduces observable edge structure in the spectra of galactic x-ray sources at the wavelengths of the Kand L-edges of the abundant elements (these edges occur at wavelengths between 1.5 and 50 A for the light abundant elements and for iron) which contain information on the structure and composition of the interstellar matter which is complementary to that contained in the ultraviolet. Interpretation of moderate resolution x-ray spectra of strong galactic sources has already provided unique information on the total column density of heavy elements (i.e. elements heavier than H and He) in the ISM. The prospect of higher resolution x-ray spectra to be obtained with the transmission grating experiment on HEAO-B and with a rocket experiment planned at Stanford will provide data of sufficiently high spectral resolution to allow a direct measurement of the total column density of several important elements (O, N, C, Ne, Fe) in the ISM. If ultraviolet and x-ray observations of the column density in the interstellar gas are available for the same sources, it should be possible to significantly constrain ISM models with regard to: (1) the fraction of the abundance of number of elements which is bound in grains; (2) the absolute ISM abundance of a number of elements; (3) the relative abundance of elements such as Ne which do not have convenient absorption lines in the ultraviolet; (4) the ionization structure of those elements for which line saturation makes accurate determination of total column density difficult in the ultraviolet; and (5) the typical size and composition of interstellar grains. We propose to analyze IUE observations of several of the strongest x-ray sources which have well established optical counterparts in conjunction with both moderate resolution observations (which are already available from SAS-C, Copernicus and HEAO-A) and high resolution observations which are expected from our rocket program at Stanford and from HEAO-B in order to refine present models of the ISM.|Y
IGBDY|Velocity Distribution of Interstellar Clouds in Distant Spiral Arms and in the Magellanic Clouds|Donald G.|York|Princeton|We propose to measure central velocities and extreme velocities (negative and positive) for selected interstellar lines in the most distant objects possible (galactic and extragalactic). We will search for deviations of those measured quantities from values expected for gas characterized by galactic rotation and by the cloud velocity distribution function applicable near the Sun. 0ur goal is to determine what modifications of local interstellar models are needed to more generally describe interstellar gas in Galactic spiral arm regions, interarm regions, the Galactic halo from 1 kpc to 50 kpc, and the Magellanic Clouds.|Y
IGBHM|Hydrogen and Deuterium Lyman Alpha Absorption in the Local Interstellar Medium and the Far Ultraviolet Emission L Spect|H. Warren|Moos|Johns Hopkins University|We wish to obtain high-dispersion far ultraviolet spectra with very high signal-to-noise of a few late-type stars in the solar neighborhood. The main purpose is to study the interstellar H I and D I absorption features seen against the stellar Lyman-alpha emission line and to derive densities and D/H ratios for a number of lines of sight in the local interstellar medium. An important by-product of these spectra will be high signal-to-noise profiles of stellar chromosphere and transition region lines. A secondary purpose of this proposal is to analyze these other data.|Y
IGBJH|Interstellar Lines in the ETA Carina Nebula|James E.|Hesser|Dominion Astrophysical Observatory|Optical studies of the interstellar lines in the Carina Nebula point to many unique and poorly understood features, including multiple components that vary in intensity over small angular distances and a total velocity range of 330 km/sec. It has been suggested that the observed phenomena represent a new type of interstellar line structure. I wish to obtain uv spectra of a selection of the stars already observed in the optical, in order to attempt to understand the conditions leading to interstellar line formation in the nebula, as well as to compare those conditions to other, less exotic, regions.|Y
IGBJS|Atomic Intersystem Lines in Interstellar Gas and Stellar Winds|J. Michael|Shull|Colorado|In this program we hope to detect weak atomic intersystem absorption lines in interstellar gas and in the winds of early-type stars. By supplementing the intersystem lines with strong interstellar resonance line data, one may obtain accurate abundances of 0, Si, and perhaps S. Intersystem line profiles of more highly ionized species in stellar winds may be used in conjunction with resonance line PCygni profiles as density diagnostics. These two objectives are combined in this program by using as background sources distant Ostars with substantial winds.|Y
IGBMJ|Observations of Interstellar Zinc|Michael|Jura|UCLA|We request 96 hours of telescope time to use IUE to observe interstellar zinc. Observations with Copernicus toward zeta Oph suggest that zinc is undepleted in this line of sight (Morton 1975), and we propose to determine the gas phase zinc abundance in a number of lines of sight with different amounts of depletion to determine whether zinc does or does not adhere to grains. If zinc is mostly found in the gas phase, it should be possible to use the zinc abundances to infer the rms variations in metallicity in the local interstellar medium.|Y
IGBPF|IUE Observations of Interstellar Lines In Stars Near the North Polar Spur|Priscalla C.|Frisch|Chicago|It is proposed to use the sensitive high resolution spectrometer on board the International Ultraviolet Explorer to study the interstellar gas in front of the nearby stars alpha Oph and gamma Oph which are located in the line of sight towards the North Polar Spur. It is the purpose of these observations to determine if the properties of this gas conform to those expected in material which has been processed by a shock front. If they do, it would be compelling evidence that a portion of the material associated with the North Polar Spur lies within 20 pc of the sun. High resolution ground-based observations will be made to supplement the ultraviolet data.|Y
IGBTS|The Physical State and Distribution of Gas in Our Galaxy, II|Theodore P.|Stecher|NASA/GSFC|We wish to include 20 Tau and 23 Tau in our existing IUE observing program of vibrationally excited H2. Jura has shown from Copernicus observations that the pumping rate for H2 for these stars is the highest known. These stars also show the largest known CH+ density. We (Stecher and Williams 1972, 1974) have published a theory of CH+ formation involving vibrationally excited H2.  These observations will determine the validity of our theory. We also wish to study the pumping mechanism which we (Stecher and Williams 1967) have shown under other circumstances to cause the destruction of H2 in the interstellar medium.|Y
IGBWS|IUE Observing Time and Support of Research on Interstellar Lines in the Galactic Halo|Wallace L.|Sargent|CIT|Ten sessions in shift one are requested to obtain high dispersion spectra of interstellar resonant absorption lines against distant high-latitude earlytype stars. These observations would provide a far more sensitive probe of the interstellar gas in the galactic halo than previous methods (using the 21 cm H I emission lines and the Ca H+K and the Na D lines).  The proposed observations should be able to establish convincingly the existence or absence of a substantial gaseous halo around the Galaxy. When present, the interstellar resonant absorption lines should allow determinations of the physical properties (e.g. density, temperature and metal abundance), the spatial and kinematic structure of the gaseous halo.  The existence and properties of a gaseous halo around the Galaxy have implications for several important astrophysical questions such as, (1) the existence of a massive halo around the Galaxy, (2) the accretion of intergalactic gas by the Galaxy (and therefore the evolution of the Galaxy), (3) the nature of high velocity H I gas observed at various high galactic latitudes, and (4) the origin of the quasar absorption lines.|Y
IGCAU|Interstellar Lines From High Ions|Anne B.|Underhill|NASA/GSFC|Strong, slightly displaced interstellar lines from Si IV, C IV and N V are present in the spectrum of P Cygni. These lines may be stronger than usual examples of the sharp lines from high ions commonly seen in the spectra of stars, or they may be revealing interstellar material which has been shocked by the explosion of P Cygni which occurred in the 1600 A.D. It is proposed to elucidate this question by observing the interstellar lines from high ions in the spectra of (1) stars lying within the shocked H II region around eta Carinae, (2) stars lying in H II regions not known to have been shocked and (3) stars not enveloped in a conspicuous H II region and comparing their strengths and displacements.|Y
IGCAW|IUE Studies of QSO Absorption Line Gas|A.|Wolfe|Pittsburgh|IUE observations of quasi-stellar objects whose spectra are known to have absorption lines can provide important information concerning the nature of these systems. In particular, observations of the L-alpha line in systems which show MgII and Fe II absorption can be combined with radio measurements of the 21 cm line to deduce the spin temperature of the HI gas. The spin temperature is related to excitation conditions and may provide a clue to the origin of the absorbing gas. Furthermore, observation of the He I  584 transition in highly redshifted systems may help to specify the level of ionization in a class of these absorbing clouds.|Y
IGCBS|Ultraviolet Observations of Gas in Galactic Halos|Blair D.|Savage|Wisconsin|We are asking for observing time to continue our research program which concerns interstellar matter in the  halos of the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds. Some of the specific issues that we will address with the additional observing time include: (1, Does the Milky Way Halo gas co-rotate with the interstellar matter in the galactic disk? (2) Can a stronger case be made for the existence of a region of Halo gas around the Magellanic Clouds? and (3) What is the origin of the very high velocity cloud seen toward the SMC star HD 5980?|Y
IGCDY|Extent of a Gaseous Galactic Halo|Donald G.|York|Princeton|IUE observations of high latitude, low velocity absorption lines in Magellanic cloud stars have been interpreted as indicating that a hot halo exists out to about 8 kpc above the plane of the Galaxy. Observationally, this "hot" gas contains C IV and C II, Si II, and O I at the same velocities. Whatever the cause of the coexistence of these quite different ionization stages, we can predict that absorption lines of Mg II (2800 A) observed in spectra of the cores of globular clusters (d ~1 10 kpc) will show almost the same velocity spread and equivalent widths as those seen in the Magellanic Cloud stars (d ~ 70 kpc). We propose to make long integrations of the cores of M15, 47 Tuc, NGC 362, and a few other objects to test this prediction of the current interpretation of velocities of halo gas. Successful similar observations of Ca II in M15 and NGC 362 are discussed, to demonstrate the technique.|Y
IGCFB|The Origins of Interstellar C IV and SI IV|Frederick C.|Bruhweiler|CSC|We outline, here, a systematic investigation to determine the origins of C IV and Si IV in the interstellar medium. So far, our investigations of these ions in 17 stars has shown a definite correlation of C IV and Si IV column densities indicating a new temperature regime in the interstellar medium in the range of some 40, 000K The physical process responsible for these ions is unclear, but photoionization cannot explain the observed ionization. We propose an observational program which provides data for four definite tests for the following physical processes; 1. Photoionization 2. Supernova remnants and interstellar bubbles 3. X-rays via Auger ionization 4. High density, low velocity circumstellar gas around interacting binaries.  These tests form strict guidelines for finding the physical process responsible for interstellar C IV and Si IV.|Y
IGCJS|IUE Spectroscopic Studies of Interstellar Matter and Stellar Mass Loss|J. Michael|Shull|Colorado|We propose to observe young stars in the Cygnus and Monoceros OB associations, using both long and short wavelength spectrographs of the IUE in high resolution mode. We will study interstellar abundances and cloud velocities toward these associations and will determine, whenever possible, mass loss rates from stellar P-Cygni profiles. It is hoped that these systematic analyses will elucidate the relationship between OB associations and the dynamics of the interstellar medium.|Y
IGCLC|Absorption Measures of Galactic Halo Gas|L.|Cowie|Princeton University|Evidence for hot 80000K gas has recently been presented based on IUE spectra of high latitude extragalactic stars in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds.  One very interesting problem highlighted by these results is the nature of the rotation curve for halo gas, a version of which has recently been used to obtain gas distributions from observed absorption lines attributed to the halo. Based on a few observations, C IV appears to exist only out to 8 kpc. By comparison, C IV lines in quasars must arise at 50-100 kpc from cores of galaxies if absorption lines in quasar spectra are interpreted as arising in galactic halos.  We propose to observe a number of extragalactic sources in which we expect to see absorption lines from a galactic halo. Using the IUE high dispersion mode, we will be able to discern whether a model of a rotating halo is consistent with the observations, or whether other processes are important for understanding velocities in the halo gas. Background sources are selected from a) Seyfert galaxies and QSO's whose emission lines are red shifted by appropriate amounts to coincide with galactic absorption lines and b) cores of elliptical galaxies, bright enough to provide a strong continuum at Mg II 2800 A.|Y
IGCTS|A Search for Interstellar Si O|Theodore P.|Snow|Colorado|It has been predicted on the basis of gas-phase chemistry models that several siliconbearina molecules, including SiO, should be moderately abundant in diffuse clouds. It is proposed to test these predictions by searching for transitions in SiO near 2300A that have known oscillator strengths. The appropriate sensitivity level can be reached by averaging spectra together, provided the large aperture is used and the star position varied, so that the spectra will be projected into slightly different arrays of pixels, allowing the fixed pixel-to-pixel noise to be reduced in the averaging process. For moderately reddened (F(b-v) =0.6) stars the expected column density of several times 10^12 cm^-2 will produce an equivalent width of 5-15mA for the strongest line of SiO. We request time to obtain several exposures of one star.|Y

IGEJS|IUE Interstellar Observations of Bright OB-Stars|J. Michael|Shull|University of Colorado at Boulder|We propose to obtain several high-resolution IUE exposures (SWP and LWR) of bright OB-stars, previously observed by the Copernicus satellite. These IUE exposures are all short and may be observed on the highbackground shift (US-2). After stacking the data, we will obtain interstellar abundances through a curve-of-growth analysis. Preliminary studies of two bright stars show that the extended wavelength coverage of IUE allows one to obtain improved column densities of elements studied by Copernicus, as well as of new elements available only to IUE. The proposed target stars will also fill a gap in IUE interstellar observations at reddenings 0.05 < E(B-V) < 0.30.  We have chosen stars for which Copernicus H2 absorption data exists. Therefore, we will be able to derive actual cloud conditions (density, kinetic temperature, UV radiation field) from the rotational populations. We plan to study correlations of cloud temperatures, metal depletions, and molecular fractions with actual cloud densities derived from H2 rather than from line-of-sight averages, N(H)/d. The comparison of data from IUE and Copernicus (of differing wavelength coverage, photometric sensitivity, and spectral resolution) will also provide useful guidance in the design of future far-UV spectroscopic instruments.|Y
IGELH|IUE Observations of Interstellar Carbon|Lewis M.|Hobbs|Chicago|We propose high-dispersion IUE observations of the semi-forbidden interstellar absorption line of C II at lambda(air) - 2324.69 A in the spectra of six or more stars. To date, this interstellar line has been detected, at the 4 sigma level, only in Copernicus observations of delta Scorpii, where it attains an equivalent width Wlambda = 0.6 mA. While its detection requires high photometric accuracy, this line is intrinsically so weak that it allows much more accurate measurement of the abundance of carbon in the interstellar gas than do the accessible permitted lines of C II. The required photometric accuracy can be achieved by careful analysis of pattern noise on the detector. With the assumption that the sum of the interstellar carbon abundances in the gas and in the grains is given by the solar carbon ratio, these measurements will also yield accurate estimates of what fraction is contributed by carbon to the mass of the interstellar grains, since the total mass of the grains can be estimated from the corresponding interstellar reddening in each of the directions studied, according to the general arguments of Purcell (1969).|Y
IGFBS|The Galactic Distribution of Highly Ionized Gas|Blair D.|Savage|Wisconsin|Six IUE shifts are requested to obtain high dispersion SWP spectra of galactic B stars with line of sight distances, r > 1 kpc and distances away from the galactic plane | z | < 1 kpc. The data will be combined with existing data for stars with | z | > 1 kpc to study the general interstellar C IV density x distributions as a function of | z |. B stars are selected as targets to minimize the contamination due to C IV absorption in the surrounding H II regions. The data requested will eliminate a serious sampling bias that now exists in studies of galactic halo gas. The measurements should allow us to establish whether or not the Milky Way has a C IV "transition layer."|Y

IGFGB|An Absorption Line Study of High Latitude Diffuse Clouds|Gibor S.|Basri|UC Berkeley|We propose to study diffuse clouds at high latitudes that have been identified in uvby beta photometric surveys. We will study absorption lines in the spectra of thirteen stars in two small (4 x 4) fields that contain these clouds. The ultraviolet absorption line data, when combined with the reddening and distance information gained from the photometry, and the optical absorption line study that we have already initiated, will provide a very complete evaluation of the physical state of these diffuse clouds. With this information, we will be able to assess quantitatively the accuracy of the photometric technique for detecting very small excesses. We will estimate abundances and depletions, and relate these to reddening values. By using stars at different distances, we will probe the structure of the ISM along the line of sight, and determine the location of components of different velocity and ionization. We may detect highly ionized species and determine their association with the clouds. Finally, we will initiate a long term study of the transition region between the very local ISM and the global ISM.|Y

IGFJR|White Dwarfs and the Interstellar Medium|John C.|Raymond|CFA|Narrow absorption lines of the highly ionized species C IV and Si IV have been detected in the spectra of hot white dwarfs. While it is often unclear whether these lines are stellar or Interstellar In origin, the large systemic velocity of Feige 24 has made it possible to discriminate between stellar and interstellar features. The Feige 24 spectrum shows both stellar and interstellar C IV and Si IV lines of about equal strength, while only stellar N V lines and interstellar lines of low ionization stages are present. Models of low density interstellar gas ionized by hot white dwarfs show that Feige 24 could create enough of an H II region to account for the interstellar C IV and Si IV. Standard estimates of white dwarf birthrates and cooling times suggest that photoionization by white dwarfs may account for much of the C IV and Si IV interstellar absorption observed toward more distant stars. The required ionization zones are 1/2 to 1 pc in radius, so the theory can be tested by observations of stars which lie behind the ionized zones surrounding nearby hot white dwarfs.|Y
IGFJS|IUE Interstellar Observations|J. Michael|Shull|Colorado - JILA|The Carina Nebula provides one of the best laboratories to study the impact of very massive stars on their surrounding interstellar medium. Some of the earliest, most massive stars in our galaxy are located in this region. The interstellar gas in the Carina Nebula is known to be highly disturbed from the optical Ca II and Na I lines, and from the low ionization interstellar lines in the UV. The largest velocity ranges yet observed in our galaxy (550 km/sec in the UV, 410 km/sec in the optical) are associated with this region.  We propose to study the high-ionization and excited fine-structure level lines in the high dispersion UV spectra of at least sixteen stars in the Carina Nebula using archival IUE data. The objective is to determine the origin of each velocity component in these interstellar lines by comparing the column density, velocity displacement, depletion and electron density calculated from the observed data with the predictions for various mechanisms, such as photoionization, semitorrid zones of gas, and shock waves from stellar winds and supernovae. The physical state of the gas in this active region can then be described.|Y
IGFLH|IUE Observations of Interstellar Carbon|Lewis M.|Hobbs|Chicago|We propose continued high-dispersion IUE observations of the semiforbidden interstellar absorption line of C II at lambda(air) = 2324.69A in the spectra of six or more stars. While its detection requires high photometric accuracy, this line is intrinsically so weak that it allows much more accurate measurement of the abundance of carbon in the interstellar gas than do the accessible permitted lines of C II. With the assumption that the sun of the interstellar carbon abundances in the gas and in the grains is given by the solar carbon ratio, such measurements will also yield accurate estimates of what fraction is contributed by carbon to the mass of the interstellar grains, since the total mass of the grains can be estimated from the corresponding interstellar reddening in each of the directions studied. To date, this interstellar line has been detected, at the 4 a level, only in Copernicus observations of delta Scorpii, where it attains an equivalent width Wlambda = 0.6 mA. The required photometric accuracy now has been achieved by careful analysis of the response pattern of the detector, in fifthyear IUE observations recently acquired by us to explore this possibility,|Y
IGGBS|A Study of Interstellar Gas Kinematics in the Large Magellanic Cloud|Blair D.|Savage|Wisconsin|Low-ionization stage interstellar lines towards LMC stars exhibit a velocity extent of over 150 kms^-1, centered near the LMC radial velocity. This range is much greater than that expected from the LMC disk gas or from nebular gas near the target stars. The additional absorption may arise from high-z LMC gas, or perhaps from a warp in the LMC plane. We propose to investigate the global kinematics of this absorption utilizing high-dispersion data obtained from the IUE Data Archives. The consideration of data from all regions of the LMC may allow the nature of the absorbing gas to be determined.|Y
IGGCB|Distribution of the Neutral Interstellar Hydrogen Toward The South Galactic Pole|C. Stuart|Bowyer|Berkeley|One of the most surprising results that has come out of the study of nearby stars at UV and EUV wavelengths is the extremely low column density of neutral hydrogen along certain lines of sight. However, these investigations have mainly been carried out with stars located in the galactic plane. There is little information on the distribution of neutral interstellar gas in the solar vicinity at higher galactic latitudes, and nothing at all is known about the direction towards the South Galactic Pole. We therefore propose to probe the local interstellar space in that direction to determine the amount of neutral hydrogen in depth. We will use early and medium type stars along this line of sight to observe the strongest absorption lines: at UV wavelengths arising from abundant interstellar species, mainly MgII. From these data, HI column densities will be derived which should be at least one order of magnitude less than those observable in 21 cm-observations.|Y
IGGDL|Interstellar Atomic and Molecular Observations of Stars Toward Reflection Nebulae|David J.|Lien|Michigan State|Radio emission studies of reflection nebulae show that these nebulae are good tracers of molecular clouds; indeed, the physical association of the embedded star with the cloud can be used to determine the mass of the molecular cloud - the angular extent of the CO cloud can be transformed to linear dimensions based on the spectroscopic parallax of the star. Many of the stars embedded in reflection nebulae have over one magnitude of visual extinction. This suggests, but does not prove, that the diffuse clouds responsible for this absorption are physically associated with the larger molecular clouds containing the reflection nebulae.  I propose to observe the atomic and molecular absorption lines toward eight heavily reddened (A v >1 magnitude) stars associated with reflection nebulae with known CO emission. The data for each star will consist of more than four coadded high dispersion spectra in both wavelength regions (four spectra obtained from this proposal, additional spectra to be obtained from archival data). Equivalent widths from atomic and molecular (^12 CO, ^13 CO, and possibly C2 ) species will be transformed to  column densities and compared with radio (CO, CII, OH, H2CO) and optical (CN, CH, CH+, NaI, CaI, CaII) data. I propose to address following points with these observations and comparisons: 1) what the percentage of ^12 CO and ^13 CO in the foreground diffuse cloud is; 2) what the temperature, density, and depletions are within the diffuse cloud; 3) whether the physical conditions within the molecular cloud are similar to those in the diffuse cloud; 4) what the relationship between the excitation temperature of CO in the diffuse and molecular clouds is; 5) whether more exotic molecules have survived in the diffuse cloud due to the non-disruptive properties of the embedded star; and 6) whether there is a difference between the physical conditions found in diffuse clouds associated with reflection nebulae and those associated with HII regions.  Additional high dispersion optical observations and high resolution radio observations will be made to support these data.|Y
IGGDY|Distances of 21cm High Velocity (Oort) Clouds|Donald|York|The University of Chicago|It has been known for about 20 years that high velocity 21 cm clouds (( |v(lsr)|>100 km s^-1) exist at high latitudes in the Galaxy. The origin of these clouds is not known. They may be anywhere from 1 to 100 kpc from the galactic disk. No mass estimates exist, save those using 21 cm fluxes, assumed distances, and assumed fractional ionizations. The properties of these clouds in other species, such as Mg I, Mg II, C II, Si III, C IV or Si IV are largely unknown. The clouds may be typical of systems in other galaxies. If they are generic to most galaxies, they may account for the large velocity widths seen in QSO absorption line systems, whatever their origin. Demonstrating the origin of these clouds (ejecta of supernova explosions, extensions of galactic spiral arms, infalling intergalactic gas, orbiting trash in the local group) depends on determining their distances.  We propose a preliminary program aimed at determining properties and distances of these clouds.  1) We propose to determine what ions exist in or around the clouds by observing distant QSO's and Seyfert galaxies that lie in the direction of the clouds.  2) We propose to study the UV spectra of RR lyrae stars that form ideal probes of the distances to these clouds.  3) We propose to observe objects at a range of distances toward these clouds, on the thesis that rough distances are known once absorption lines at the cloud velocity are seen in the spectrum of an object of known distance (and not seen in spectra of closer objects).|Y
IGGFB|Planetary Nebulae and Sharp-Lined Displaced Features in White Dwarfs|Frederick C.|Bruhweiler|Catholic University|Sharp shortward-shifted spectral features in two (2) hot white dwarfs and three (3) 0 subdwarfs indicate mass loss. The presence of such features in white dwarfs is quite puzzling. One possible explanation for the white dwarf features is that these lines are formed in old diffuse planetary nebulae. Yet, the presence of non-resonance lines of Si III in 2111+49 suggest a dense shell rather than an old planetary nebula. Since these stars have such large gravitational binding energies, other possible models might require "exotic" interpretations. Thus, the planetary nebula interpretation must be thoroughly explored before we consider such models. We identify five (5) early-type stars which would lie behind putative old planetary nebulae around the two white dwarfs exhibiting the shortward-displaced features. Observations of circumstellar material in the UV spectra of these stars could prove or disprove the old planetary nebula model. This question can be resolved with a small investment of IUE time, namely, one (1) US2 shift.|Y
IGGJH|Investigation of High-Velocity Interstellar Gas Toward HD 50896|Joy|Nichols-Bohlin|CSC|We have recently discovered an enormous, high-velocity, lowionization, expanding gas structure which may be associated with the well-known Wolf-Rayet star HD 50896. We detected it using IUE spectra of four stars within 2 of HD 50896 and at a distance of 700-1000 parsecs, suggesting a linear diameter of at least 25 parsecs. The data collected so far exhibit only blue-shifted components which can be interpreted either as a heretofore unknown supernova remnant or an interstellar bubble.  HD 50896 is a runaway Wolf-Rayet star widely believed to have a compact companion. If this large structure is related to HD 50896, investigation of its properties is crucial to our understanding of the formation and evolution of binary Wolf-Rayet stars.  We propose to obtain high-dispersion spectra for selected stars located both at greater angular distances and behind the high-velocity structure. These additional observations are essential in determing the structure's actual extent, distance and potential connection with HD 50896.|Y
IGGJR|Soft X-Ray Ionization of Interstellar Gas|John C.|Raymond|CFA|Theoretical studies of X-ray sources indicate that sizeable Stromgren  spheres of highly ionized gas -are formed about them in the interstellar medium, and that observable column densities of C IV, N V and Si IV should be present. These calculations have not yet been confirmed because most X-ray sources are distant, and many have 0 or B star companions, so that it is very difficult to unambiguosly discriminate between highly ionized species created by the X-rays and those normally present in the hot star's H II region or elsewhere along the line of sight. The soft X-ray source AM Her provides a target free of these difficulties.|Y
IGGJS|IUE Interstellar Observations|J. Michael|Shull|Colorado-Lasp|We propose continued studies of interstellar matter (H I content, heavy element depletions, and grain extinction) in the "local" medium, the disk, and halo. We will use distant OB stars and nearby white dwarfs as background sources. By profile fitting Ly-alpha and by curve-ofgrowth analyses, we will study correlations of heavy element depletions (Fe, Si, Mn, Zn, Mg, Co, Ni, Al) and gas content with distance, galactic longitude, and galactic scale height. In addition, we will develop a new technique of deriving H I column densities from low-resolution Ly-alpha data, thereby pushing our survey into distant heavily reddened regions such as the Cygnus rift.  The main scientific goals of these abundance and gas content surveys are to provide basic knowledge on the structure, metallicity, and thermal characteristics of the interstellar medium. Correlation studies with E(B-V), galactic coordinates (1,b,d), and mean line-ofsight density N(H I)/d may distinguish between competing theories of grain formation. Ultimately, these studies will have implications for EUV/soft X-ray opacities to extragalactic sources and for studies of quasar absorption line systems.|Y
IGGRF|UV Absorption Line Invest. in the Line-Of-Sight Direction To the SNR Puppis A|Robert A.|Fesen|Colorado-LASP|Wu et al. (1983) recently reported IUE ultraviolet spectra taken of an sdOB star projected near the center of the supernova remnant SNR 1006 AD. These data showed very strong and broad Fe+ resonance absorption lines together with 5000 km s^-1 redshifted Si^+, Si^+2, Si^+3 absorption features. This exciting discovery is direct evidence for high velocity, heavy element enrichment in young, Type I SNRs.  Unfortunately, with one possible exception, this kind of valuable UV investigation cannot be applied to other suspected young, galactic supernova remnants. This is because almost all other young remnants have large foreground reddening, uncertain distance estimates, and no early-type and centrally located background stars.  The one exception is the suspected young Type II SNR of Puppis A. This remnant exhibits strong enrichment of nitrogen in its optical filaments and abundance ratios for O/Fe and Ne/Fe three to five times cosmic values via Einstein observations. Recent optical observations (Kirshner and Winkler 1983) lend more evidence to indicate that Puppis A may be an older version of Cas A.  We propose, therefore, a UV absorption line investigation of Puppis A similar that done for SNR 1006. The estimated distance to Puppis A is only 2 kpc and it has relatively low foreground reddening [E(B-V) <= 0.2]. One target star, HD 71019, is at a distance of 2.6 kpc and lies in the direction of the remnant's brightest and most numerous filamentary region. Our objective is to obtain spectra of this and neighboring stars, in order to investigate the remnant's absorption lines and thus elemental abundances in this Type II remnant using the rich ultraviolet spectral region.|Y
IGIJN|Investigation of High-Velocity Interstellar Gnterstellar Gas in Line-Of-Sight to Two Wolf-Rayet Stars|Joy|Nichols-Bohlin|STScI|High-velocity components in the low-ionization interstellar lines have been observed in the IUE spectra of two Wolf-Rayet stars, HD 97152 and HD 96548. We propose to investigate these regions by observing several additional stars in these lines-of-sight, thus determining the distances, spatial extents, and abundances for the high-velocity structures detected.  The goal is to ascertain if these high-velocity interstellar structures could be interpreted as very old, previously undetected, supernova remnants, as in the case of the hiqh-velocity gas in the line-of-sight to another WolfRayet star, HD 50896 (Nichols-Bohlin and Fesen 1986). It is fundamentally important for the study of the evolution of massive stars to determine if Wolf-Rayet stars have been associated with supernova remnants in their past, and to investigate the properties of these stars and supernova remnants.|Y
IGJJS|UV Observations of Intergalactic Gas in the Coma Void|J. Michael|Shull|Colorado - CASA|In the past few years, astronomers have become aware that the large-scale distribution of galaxies is inhomogeneous, exhibiting 'bubbles and voids'. This structure may originate in the explosive-galaxy scenario of Ostriker and Cowie (1981). If so, the intergalactic medium may contain H I shells enriched with small amounts of heavy elements. Regions not swept by blast waves may contain pristine intergalactic hydrogen clouds. A simple analysis of the detectability of these shells (Shull and Silk 1981) suggests that they should be seen in UV resonance lines of H I and C IV.  We propose IUE low-resolution SWP observations of four active galaxies in the Coma-A1367 foreground void. The objective of this search is to find evidence of cold (H I) or warm photoionized (C IV) intergalactic gas between us and the Coma supercluster. Our targets have never been observed by IUE, but they have the virtue of being brighter than other quasars in the area. The radio galaxy 3C-264 is a good example, since it has V = 12.7 and is a strong point Xray source. The IUE observations can detect intergalactic gas with N(H I) > 10^14 cm^-2 or N(C IV) > 2 x 10^14 cm^-2. Thus, even null detections will set important cosmological limits on gas in the void. Detection of the galaxies' UV continua will also be important for the design of HRS experiments on the Hubble Space Telescope. The Coma void has the unique advantage of being near enough to check for faint intervening galaxies optically (fully 2 magnitudes fainter than Bootes), and yet sufficiently distant that intergalactic absorption is redshifted away from Galactic interstellar absorption.|Y
IGJTS|Extinction Properties of Cool-Star Circumstellar Grains|Theodore P.|Snow|Colorado - CASA|We propose to investigate the ultraviolet extinction from circumstellar envelopes of oxygen-rich M-supergiants and carbon-rich protoplanetary-nebula stars. By taking low-resolution, largeaperture IUE spectra of the hot-companions of M-supergiants in binaries, we can study the extinction of grains in a variety of cool-star envelopes because we will be able to better classify the hot stars and to derive, with the pair method, new circumstellar selective-extinction (spectral) curves for different stellar spectral types and luminosity classes. Using the acquired data we will be able to examine the effects of environment (differing ionizing flux, envelope temperature and density) on the formation of and spectral properties of oxygen-rich grains.  Our observations will also permit us to partially de-convolve the photometry of the composite systems and to estimate the distances to these M-supergiants. The two carbon-rich protoplanetary-nebula stars will provide a sharp contrast to the oxygen-rich supergiants, particularly at the 2175 A extinction feature, which is thought to originate from carbonaceous grains. Another proposal to analyze IUE and IRAS archival spectra of similar binaries (VV Cephei type) will broaden the scope of our survey by obtaining spectral extinctions of other stellar spectral-luminosity types. We hope, thus, by identifying extinction features of oxygen-rich or carbon-rich grain-formation sites, that knowledge of the extinction properties of these grain types will increase our understanding of the general, interstellar grain mixture.|Y
IGKDM|A Study of the Cep OB3 Cloud|Derck L.|Massa|ARC|we intend to combine ground based interstellar absorption line data for CH, CN, CH^+ and Ca with IUE measurements of CO, H I, C I, Zn II, S I and II for stars in and near the Cep OB3 molecular cloud. Together, these data will enable us to probe the structure this classical giant molecular cloud and to test some of the fundamental physical and chemical processes thought to occur in such clouds. To obtain our objectives, 5 US1 shifts will be required.|Y
IGKFB|The Interstellar Environment of Supernova 1987A|Frederick C.|Bruhweiler|Catholic University|Our analysis of optical narrow bandpass and Einstein X-ray imagery, as well as the interstellar IUE spectrum of the Supernova 1987a suggests that the explosion occurred in a large H II region/ superbubble complex with a diameter of -1 kpc. We argue against the need for the presence of a UV-flash or a circumstellar envelope ejected during the red supergiant phase of the progenitor. The large concentration of OB stars (over 700) near SN 1987a and the 1 kpc dimensions of the [O III] emission negates any need for a UV-flash to explain the strong C IV and Si IV. Predictions by Chevalier and interpretation of the developing narrow emission line spectrum imply that one should see evidence due to a low ionization circumstellar envelope in the interstellar absorption spectrum. High dispersion observations of two nearby stars in the LMC with projected linesof-sight 35 and 60 pc from the position of SN 1987a are proposed. The interstellar spectrum of these stars, which are free of any putative effects of an UV-flash or circumstellar envelope, will further constrain the final interpretations of the IUE interstellar spectra of SN 1987a. These observations are extremely important (and as of now a unique opportunity) in understanding both the immediate circumstellar environment and the ambient interstellar conditions surrounding a SN.|Y
IGKJN|High-Velocity Interstellar Gas in the Lines-Of-Sight to Wolf-Rayet Stars|Joy|Nichols-Bohlin|CSC IUE|High-velocity interstellar line components have been observed in the IUE spectra of four field Wolf-Rayet stars. From investigations of adjacent fines of sight to these four stars, we have discovered in each case strong evidence for a previously unknown, large, expanding shell of gas 50 - 100 pcs in diameter. In at least two of the cases, the shell is best interpreted as an evolved SNR, possibly associated with the Wolf-Rayet star. These stars may be in "the second Wolf-Rayet phase of evolution", i.e. stars which were previously members of a massive binary star system but, after the supernova explosion of the primary, are now runaway objects, probably having compact companions and ring nebulae associated with them. Detection of stars in this stage of evolution is fundamentally important to the understanding of massive star evolution.  One of the largest interstellar shells detected is in the line-of-sight to the WN6 star HD 192163. Optical and IR emission surveys indicate the presence of a 3' shell-like structure that is nearly centered on this star. However, incomplete existing UV data do not permit an in-depth analysis on the origin and properties of this interstellar shell structure. Similarly, we only have incomplete information regarding our newly discovered shell apparently associated with the WR star HD 96548. We, therefore, propose to obtain highdispersion UV spectra on the fainter and more highly reddened background stars around HD 192163 and HD 96548 in order to complete our UV/IR investigations. Our goal is to obtain adequate spatial and abundance information on these interstellar shell structures which will allow us to (1) define their expansion velocities, element depletions, and kinetic energies, and (2) combine these IUE results with IRAS and optical data analysis to deduce their true origins.|Y
IGKJS|IUE Observations of Intergalactic Gas in the Coma Void|J. Michael|Shull|Colorado - CASA|In the past few years, astronomers have become aware that the large-scale distribution of galaxies is inhomogeneous, exhibiting "bubbles and voids". If this structure originates in an "explosive galaxy" scenario, the intergalactic medium may contain H I shells enriched with small amounts of heavy elements. Regions not swept by blast waves may contain intergalactic hydrogen clouds, whose metallicity is also of great current interest. A simple analysis of the detectability of these shells (Shull and Silk 1981) suggests that they should be seen in UV resonance lines of H I, C IV, and perhaps other low-ionization species such as Mg II or C II.  During the past year, we have re-analyzed archival IUE data toward 3 QSOs claimed by Brosch and Gondalekhar (1984) to show absorption at the redshift of the Bootes and PerseusPisces voids. With better extraction and co-added spectra, we find no evidence for absorption in 2 of these cases, and slight evidence for Si IV absorption in a third. We also have analyzed 30 Seyferts and QSOs towards the Coma supercluster, and find no conclusive void absorptions. However, three objects located close together on the sky and near the center of the Coma void show evidence for Mg II absorption at z = 0.015 (4500 km s^-1). The single 385 min LWP spectrum of B2 1308+326 (V = 16.0, z = 0.996) is the most convincing of the three. In the same area, PG 1309+355 (V = 15.45, z = 0.184) has but a single SWP exposure and no LWP.  This year, we propose IUE low-resolution observations of two active galactic nuclei toward Coma, B2 1308+326 and PG 1309+355, in an attempt to confirm the Mg II absorption toward the first and obtain detections or limits for C II, Si II, Si III, C IV, and Si IV. These sources are probably the best probes of intergalactic matter in the Coma void. Our line-by-line extraction technique and co-added spectra increase the signal-to-noise considerably over previous searches for weak features.|Y
IGKSL|UV Spectroscopy of Young Stellar Populations in Interacting Galaxies|Susan A.|Lamb|Illinois|Collisions between galaxies have been implicated in the production of a wide range of energetic phenomena, including QSOs, AGN'S, and "star burst" nuclei. These phenomena can produce-different, distinct ultraviolet spectra and we propose to explore this aspect of their behavior for a small sample of closely interacting and merging galaxies for which we have supporting optical, radio, and infrared observations. The emphasis of our work will be to model the massive star populations in known star burst nuclei to investigate whether stellar populations produced during galaxy collisions are measurably abnormal. Additionally, we will search for evidence in the UV spectra of co-existence of AGN and "starburst" nuclei.|Y
IGLBS|A Study of the Origin of Highly Ionized Interstellar Gas|Blair D.|Savage|Wisconsin|We propose to study the highly ionized interstellar gas by obtaining IUE interstellar absorption line data toward six stars for which interstellar O VI absorption line measurernents from the Copernicus satellite are available. By interrelating absorption lines of ions of differing ionization potential, specifically Al Ill, Si IV, C IV and N v from IUE and O VI from Copernicus, we expect to be able to constrain models for the origin of highly ionized gas in the interstellar medium. The study will involve an intercomparison of absorption column densities and of velocities. The research is of importance to our understanding of the physical state and distribution of interstellar gas in the galactic disk and in the galactic halo.|Y
IGLRD|The Carbon Abundance in Thesuper Metal Poorgalaxy GR 8|Reginald J.|Dufour|Rice University|We propose to obtain three 16+ hour SWP low dispersion spectra of the brightest H II region in the nearby metal-poor dwarf irregular galaxy GR 8 via combined ESA/SERC + US shifts. The primary objective is to measure the C III]A909 emission line for determination of the gaseousphase carbon abundance in this galaxy, for which O/H is only 3% of solar. GR 8 is one of only a very few galaxies known to have O/H at 2-3% of solar; that is, comparable to I Zw 18, for which recent IUE and ground-based observations have found surprisingly high CIO and N/O values. The unexpectedly high C/O found in I Zw 18 for its O/H value is counter to the trend of C/O proportional to O/H found in several metal-poor irregulars with giant H II regions previously studied with the IUE, and thus observations of GR 8 would be fundamental to evaluating the reversed C/O trend at lowest O/H indicated by I Zw 18. In addition, the UV stellar continuum of GR 8 from the SWP spectra will provide information about the comparative high mass IMF and recent star formation history of GR 8 compared to I Zw 18. This should effectively double our knowledge regarding the UV spectra of H II regions and OB stars in chemically young star-forming galaxies at the low luminosity and metallicity limits for such galaxies.|Y
IGMJN|Investigation of High-Velocity Gas Toward Wolf-Rayet Stars|Joy|Nichols-Bohlin|CSC - Astronomy Programs|High-velocity interstellar structures detected in the directions to three separate Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars via shifted components in high-dispersion IUE spectra have now been interpreted, based on energy considerations and infrared morphology, as highly evolved SNRs virtually centered on the respective WR stars. These three stars, HD 50896, HD 96548, and HD 192163, may thus be stars in the second WR phase of massive binary star evolution, after the SN explosion of the primary. Each of the three stars has a ring nebula, a suspected compact companion, and WN5-8 spectral classification. This important discovery may be among the first observational evidence for massive binary star evolutionary theory.  The goal of this proposal is to observe three other WR stars which may also be candidates for secondphase WR stars. We have recently identified two new infrared ring nebulae via IRAS imagery, for which there are no optical counterparts, around two of these stars. In addition, these three stars have suspected compact companions, WN5-8 spectral classifications, and are possible runaway stars. We will search for high-velocity components which might be indicative of the presence of a SNR, as in the previously studied cases.|Y
IGMJS|High-Velocity Gas Along the SW Edge of the Monoceros Loop|J. Michael|Shull|Colorado - CASA|The Monoceros Loop is an old and very large Galactic supernova remnant situated between the bright Rosette Nebula to the southwest, and a larger, more diffuse H II region surrounding the OB association NGC 2264 to the north. The Monoceros Loop is one of only three remnants where background stars exhibit high-velocity interstellar line components. However, in the case of the Monoceros Loop, there is only one star, HD 47240 (BI Ib) which shows high-velocity optical and UV components at +70 km s^-1 (V[LSR]) in low ionization resonance lines. Why only this star? HD 47420 lies along the very edge of the Monoceros Loop's Southwestern rim. Despite our previous observations of several stars better centered behind the remnant, RD 47240 is still the only star showing such high-velocity absorbing interstellar gas. Our examination of IUE data on HD 47240 also reveals C IV and Si IV line components at +25 km s^-1 and we have recently discovered similar C IV and Si IV components in two other close neighboring stars. Is the low-ionization 70 km s^-1 gas related to the expansion of the Monoceros Loop or to the SNR's interaction with the Rosette Nebula? And what is the nature of the high-ionization components? In order to determine the nature of these high-velocity UV absorption features, we propose IUE observations On several previously unobserved stars whose lines of sight lie very close to HD 47240. A well defined array of sharp optical filaments in HD 47240's immediate area suggests a possible interaction of the remnant's shell with the Rosette, and we have carefully selected our target stars to lie both in and out of this filamentary structure. The specific goals to be realized from these new data are: (1) survey the remnant's SW rim for evidence of an interaction with the Rosette Nebula via study of the high-velocity low-ionization interstellar lines (e.g. Si II and Fe II) in the UV spectra of target stars; (2) investigate the high-velocity C IV and Si IV components, which might represent the remnant's true expanding shell; (3) learn about late-time SNR evolution in a cloudy ISM and the interaction of a blast wave with IS clouds; and (4) obtain accurate Monoceros Loop distance and diameter information.|Y
IGMLD|IUE Observations of a Galactic Loop|Laura|Danly|STScI|Results from 21-cm and other surveys have shown a large, arch-shaped loop of gas stretching over much of the northern galactic hemisphere. Something unusual, and probably highly energetic probably occurred over this region to disrupt the gas. Despite its prominence, very little is actually known about the origin of the loop. We propose to obtain new high resolution spectra of some previously unobserved stars in the direction of the loop. A few images toward stars lying behind the feature exist in the IUE archives, but they are generally of low signal-to-noise. We would therefore like to take additional spectra toward some of the best sightlines through the loop in order to improve signal-to-noise for a quantitative analysis.|Y
IGNLD|IUE Observations of the Intermediate Velocity Arch|Laura|Danly|STScI|The "intermediate velocity arch" is a single complex of neutral gas with fine of sight velocities between -50 and -90 km/s that covers nearly one third of the northern galactic hemisphere, and has a z distance of between 450 and 1700 pc. An unusual and probably highly energetic event has occurred in this region to disrupt the gas. Despite the large mass (about 10^5M[sun]), large energy (> 10^52 ergs), and great extent, very little is known about the origin of this gas. Our previous studies have placed upper limits on the distance to the IV arch, and revealed some interesting variations in the ionization Structure. We propose to obtain new high resolution spectra of previously unobserved stars to improve the limits on the distance to the IV arch, to determine the global ionization structure of this gas, and to determine the extent of local ionization differences within the arch.|Y
IGNTH|The Far-Ultraviolet Spectra of Powerful Far-Infrared Galaxies|Timothy M.|Heckman|Johns Hopkins University|A major result of the IRAS mission was the discovery of a class of powerful far-infrared galaxies FIRG's) having far-infrared luminosities, L[EIR] = 10 ^10 - 10^12 L[sun], and far-infrared to blue luminosity ratios of 10 - 100. Ile far-infrared radiation from these galaxies is primarily thermal emission from heated dust grains. Nuclear optical spectroscopy of a large sample of FIRG's (Armus, Heckman, and Miley 1989) has revealed evidence for large populations of young, hot stars. Optical broad-band continuum and narrow band emission-line imaging suggest a model in which the interaction 1 and rapid merger of two gas-rich spiral galaxies leads to a nuclear starburst producing 10 - 100 yr^-1 over 10^7 - 10^8 yr (Armus, Heckman, and Miley 1987, 1990).  We propose to observe three FIRG's with the SWP camera of the IUE. We will combine these spectra with archived spectra of three additional FIRG's to give us high S/N far-UV spectra of 6 FIRG's spanning almost two orders of magnitude in far-infrared luminosity. Using the stellar optimizing synthesis technique as developed by Fanelli, O'Connell, and Thuan (1987), we will determine the stellar populations that dominate the far-UV spectra of FIRG's, and access their importance in the overall energy budgets of these remarkable galaxies. The star formation history determined from the far-UV spectra will also be compared to that estimated from both the optical spectra and the continuum morphologies to test the interaction/merger induced starburst scenario in detail.|Y
IGPJC|Limits on Grain Surface Chemistry|Jason A.|Cardelli|U Wisconsin - Madison|On the basis of a sample of published extinction curves derived from IUE data along with optical molecular data, it has recently been determined (Cardelli 1993) that a strong correlation exists between the measured width, gamma, of the '2175 A' bump and N(CH)/A(V), the column density of CH molecules per magnitude of extinction and V. These results show the first tangible evidence that specific grain modification processes, as measured by extinction variations, are directly associated with specific in situ gas-phase processes. Relationships also exist between the bump width and N(CN)/A(V) and N(CO)/A(V), with more scatter because the clumpiness of the interstellar medium affects their chemistry more than it does CH.  This proposal is intended to explore these new important relationships in greater detail by determining values of gamma for sightlines with intermediate and large values of N(CH)/A(V). These results will determine if there is a spread in the gamma vs N(CH)/A(V) relation at large N(CH)/A(V), such as there is for CN. In addition, some of our targets will allow us to greatly extend the range of the gamma vs N(CO)/A(V) relation.|Y
IGPLD|Infalling Gas in the Southern Galactic Hemisphere|Laura|Danly|STScI|We wish to explore the possible relationship between infalling intermediate velocity gas (IV) in the southern galactic hemisphere with the IV Arch in the northern galactic hemisphere by comparing the dynamics and ionization balance of the two structures. The IV Arch is a coherent arch-like mass of infalling HI that covers nearly a third of the northern galactic hemisphere. Its general structure, distance, and ionization balance has been explored by a successful program of UV absorption line studies with the IUE. HI in the Southern galactic hemisphere has lower column densities and a more fragmented appearance. However, there is a seemingly coherent structure that mirrors the IV Arch. Ultraviolet absorption line spectra from lines of sight toward HI concentrations with high column densities and clear velocity separation from lower velocity gas will aid in the determination of the relationship between these two structures, and may provide further valuable insight on the well known problem of HI velocity and mass asymmetry between the northern and southern galactic hemispheres.|Y
IGPRB|Determining Gas Densities and Grain Compositions|Richard H.|Buss|Johns Hopkins University|We propose to acquire high-resolution spectra toward rapidly-rotating A2-B8 V stars that lie near the edge of the local interstellar bubble and that are heating asso ciated dust clouds of known size. The column densities of the interstellar metal lines of Zn, S, Fe, Mg, and Si will arise predominantly from a single component at the edge of the bubble, increasing the accuracy of the curve-of-growth method and allowing us to derive physical densities and grain compositions in the clouds. Such quantities will give us insight into the lifetime of the bubble and the shocks that may have formed it.|Y

The present proposal asks for observing time to secure high resolution data for a group of about 5 LMC stars to be selected from Table I. The overall goal will be the study of gaseous matter between the sun and the LMC with the emphasis divided into two principal programs which are: a) A study of the Halo of the Milky Way and b) A study of the interstellar matter in the LMC. Even with an increase in background radiation rates or a degradation in detector sensitivity, parts of the proposed program can be completed.  Ten shifts of low radiation time are requested.|Y

D.|Donn|NASA/GSFC|We propose to study the direction and extent of chemical evolution in galactic clouds utilizing atomic and molecular data from the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) and the facilities of the Goddard Space Flight Center Astrochemical Laboratories.  I. Objectives: 1. Observe UV spectra of molecules already detected via radio or optical astronomy.  2. Detect new molecules with special attention given to young clusters.  3.

IMBKD|Interstellar Extinction and Interstellar Lines in Two Close Stars Near Orion B|Klaus S.|DeBoer|Wisconsin|A small amount of IUE observing time is requested to observe one pair of stars, HD 37903 + HD 37744, on either side of the Horsehead. The stars are of equal spectral type but have quite different extinction. ANS observations probably were contaminated by diffuse light and so the anomality of the extinction curve derived from these stars is questionable. Because the stars are separated by only 40 arc min, the fainter one 100 pc farther away, they provide a unique possibility to study the interstellar gas by way of its resonance lines: the foreground effects are equal, the conditions in the gas near each star are vary different.|Y
IMCPF|Highly Obscured Interstellar Clouds|Priscilla C.|Frisch|Chicago|A proposal is made for IUE observing time to acquire data on the interstellar material associated with a group of heavily obscured stars. These data will be used to help determine the cause of the unusually strong interstellar cyanogen lines observed optically in some of the program stars. The properties of the interstellar material that will be derived from these data are the average gas depletions, carbon monoxide abundances, amount of ionized material, and the reddening curves for the interstellar grains.|Y
IMDFB|The Interstellar Medium Within 50PC of the Sun Through Observations of White Dwarfs|Frederick C.|Bruhweiler|CSC|Four white dwarfs previously observed by IUE in low dispersion are found to be accessible at high dispersion for studying the local interstellar medium. These four white dwarfs all have measured Parallaxes and are within 50 parsecs of the sun. We propose to obtain LWR and SWP high dispersion images of all four of these stars in order to study the interstellar medium near the sun. Results from this work would have a direct bearing on future EUV investigations and the suggestion that the solar system is inside a hot, low-density cavity, typified by diffuse X-ray observations and interstellar 0 VI observed toward alpha Vir.|Y
IMDGB|Ultraviolet Spectroscopy of Young Compact Regions in Dense Molecular Clouds|G. N.|Blair|Electro-Magnetic Application|It is proposed to use the IUE short wavelength, low resolution spectrograph for a period of five observing shifts to observe at least 16 of 21 compact nebulae, associated with active sites of recent and current star formation. There is ample evidence from a variety of data (optical, IR, MM and radio) to suggest that these nebulae have recently emerged from a dense ( ^nH 2 = 10^4 - 10^5 cm^-3 ) condensation on the near edge of their parent molecular cloud: All are closer than 3 kpc and exhibit luminosities at least as great as a BOIV star. Hence, each should be detectable within 60 min integration with the short wavelength camera. The objectives are (1) to determine physical characteristics, (2) to search for strong, highly ionized, spectral lines for future high resolution observations to study stellar wind molecular cloud interactions, (3) to obtain crude C and Si abundances, (4) to refine extinction estimates and (5) to resolve conflicts between sets of data at other wavelengths regarding the nature of certain sources.|Y
IMDJR|Elemental Abundances & Interstellar Dust in Supernova Remnants|John C.|Raymond|CFA|The Vela Supernova Remnant is roughly three times fainter than the Cygnus Loop, and therefore more difficult to study with IUE. It provides an important comparison however, for the study of the destruction of dust grains in shocks. In addition, extensive absorption line studies of high and low velocity material provide strong constraints on radiative shock models when combined with emission line observations. We also wish to observe a supernova remnant In NGC4449 which has only oxygen emission lines In the visual, providing an opportunity to study directly the results of nuclear processing. Unlike Cas A and N132D, this remnant is not too highly reddened to be accessible to IUE. We will search for carbon and silicon, which have no strong optical lines. We will also observe one other remnant, probably S147 to obtain abundance and grain destruction estimates.|Y
IMDTS|Interstellar Si Iv & Civ Abundances in the Lines of Sight Towards A Stars|Theodore P.|Snow|Colorado|An outstanding mystery uncovered by previous IUE observations is presented by the widespread appearance of interstellar SiIV and CIV lines in the spectra of O and B stars. Particularly difficult to understand is the high ratio of SiIV to CIV indicated by the data; current theories of the ionization of the interstellar medium cannot explain this anomaly. One possible interpretation is that the SiIV lines arise in circumstellar HII regions, where ultraviolet radiation from OB stars can ionize silicon to SiIV, while leaving carbon in lower stages, such as CII and CIII. This proposal is aimed at testing this possibility by ascertaining whether SiIV is anomalously strong in the lines of sight towards A stars, whose radiation is insufficient to produce SiIV by photoionization.  Efforts have been made to find reddened A stars not in OB associations. The data obtained through this proposal will be combined with data from a separate ESA-supported study of nearby A stars, so that a wide range of column densities will be explored.|Y
IMEJR|Grain Destruction & Elemental Abundances in Interstellar Shocks|John C.|Raymond|CFA|The minimum shock velocity required for complete destruction of refractory grains In the shocked gas Is a crucial Input parameter for models of the overall grain population and elemental depletion In the Interstellar medium. It also provides Important clues to the physical nature of the grains. Selection effects have led the observation of relatively high velocity shocks In IUE supernova remnant observations thus far. We propose one further high velocity shock observation to specify abundances and physical conditions In shocks which completely destroy grains and observations of several slower shocks which should only partially destroy them.|Y
IMFJS|Stellar and Interstellar Studies with IUE Archives|J. Michael|Shull|Colorado - JILA|We propose to use the large amount of IUE archive data on earlytype stars for studies in three areas: (1) interstellar abundances; (2) interstellar extinction curves; and (3) stellar mass loss rates. We will use the local expertise and software at the University of Colorado Regional Data Analysis Facility. We have begun studies of heavy element depletions, H I (L-alpha) column densities, and UV extinction curves for a subset of IUE stars. The requested funds will allow us to take full advantage of the archives for statistical surveys.|Y
IMFKB|Interstellar Absorption and Extinction|Karl-Heinz|Bohm|Washington|We propose to analyse existing IUE data in and immediately around the rho Oph dark cloud complex. In particular we want to study whether we can find any systemmatic changes in: 1.  the degree of ionization in the local ISM with increasing density; 2.  the degree of depletion for various elements with density; 3.  the degree of ionization and depletion with distance from UV bright stars; 4.  the wavelength dependence of the local interstellar extinction with density and/or degree of depletion of various elements.  5.  the absolute interstellar extinction with position and its effect on local ionization.  The above points can be examined by analyzing short and long wavelength IUE spectra of both high and low resolution. IUE data for a considerable number of stars around the center of the rho Oph cloud with a range in E(B-V) up to 1.00 currently exists in the archives.|Y
IMFRP|UV Study of Gas and Dust in Orion|Robert|Panek|Computer Sciences Corporation|We are primarily concerned with the extinction in the region of the Orion Trapezium. Previous studies have left an ambiguity in the interpretation of the anomaly in the Orion normalized extinction law. In particular, the suggestion is that the absolute UV extinction. i.e., A[lambda]/E(B-V). is normal in the far UV. In this view, the weakness of the normalized UV extinction, i.e., E(lambda-V)/E(B-V), is a consequence of the peculiarity of the visual extinction, the anomalously large Av/E(B-V). This ambiguity can be resolved with absolute extinction curves for a sample of stars with well determined ratios of total visual to selective extinction. Additionally, we wish to follow up on several specific questions which we raised in a 4th year study. These include: (i) the investigation of a localized cloud discovered in front of LP Ori, which contains dust with an anomalously strong 2200 A extinction bump (Sigma Sco type) and gas which is overabundant in Cl. The object is to identify correlations between abundances in the gas and peculiarities in the dust (ii) completion of a study of the T Orionis variables. This has indicated that the cause of the variability of the nebular variables is peculiar, variable extinction.|Y
IMFTS|Interstellar Lines and Ultraviolet Extinction in Dark Clouds|Theodore P.|Snow|Lab for Atomospheric & Space Physics|Molecular clouds have always been difficult to study in the ultraviolet because of the very high extinction levels. For this proposal, target stars have been selected on the basis of optical data to show very strong molecular lines, while still being bright enough to be accessible to the IUE in the high dispersion mode. Good quality high dispersion data will be analyzed to determine atomic and molecular abundances within the cloud. Low dispersion data will also be taken to determine the grain extinction properties, so that correlations among depletions, chemical activity, and grain properties can be tested. The results will provide a valuable insight into the physical conditions in dark clouds.|Y
IMGJS|Stellar Wind-Shocked H II Regions|J. Michael|Shull|Colorado-Lasp|We propose to use the IUE archives at the Colorado RDAF to Study H II regions in which stellar winds from OB-stars presumably dominate the dynamics. We plan to stack high-resolution spectra of individual earlytype stars in and behind the nebulae to determine velocity fields and column densities of H, Si, Fe, S, Mn, Zn, Ni, etc. As targets, we have chosen an "evolutionary" sequence of H II regions (Rosette Nebula, S308, S129, lambda Ori) in order to guide theoretical understanding of H II region/stellar wind interactions.  By measuring the kinematics of the gas and the total column densities of the shells, we hope to compare the "bubble" dynamics with predicted departures from standard (adiabatic) theory of Castor, McCray, and Weaver. The shell mass, when compared with total masses of young stars in the cluster, may be used to estimate the mass efficiency of star formation -- Currently controversial based on optical emission lines alone.|Y
IMGRF|Identification of Extremely Evolved Supernova Remnabts|Robert A.|Fesen|Colorado-LASP|Little is known about the properties of extremely old supernova. remnants (SNRs) due to their weak or undetectable optical and radio emissions. Yet, it is precisely the last stages in a SNR's evolution which would provide the best estimates of a remnant's total amount of swept-up mass, final size, and elemental depletion, and relationship to high-velocity interstellar clouds.  We propose the first direct measurements of some of the basic physical properties of extremely old STIRS via UV interstellar absorption lines observable in the spectra of early-type stars located behind suspected old SNRs. We have identified several large-scale, shell-like dust features which can be plausibly associated with extremely evolved remnants. An archival IUE observation supports our identification procedure as well as the feasibility of studying extremely old SNRs using methods similar to those used for much younger remnants. This new approach of identifying and studying the massive shells (> 10^3 M[sun]) absorption line measurements offers a means of probing the properties of these objects just prior to their merger with the ISM.  Spectral data collected at high resolution in the long and short wavelength regions of carefully selected target stars behind and outside the candidate remnant shells can provide direct measurements on several properties of these structures: 1) estimate of maximum dimensions of shells, 2) a measurement of the column density via curve-of-growth analysis leading to an estimate of the shell's total mass, 3) the shell's present kinetic energy and thereby an estimate of the original total energy of SNR, and 4) examination of absorption line strengths for evidence of element depletion by grains.|Y
IMGRH|Local Interstellar Medium|Richard|Henry|Johns Hopkins University|We propose to use small-aperture, high-dispersion, IUE spectra of Lyman-alpha emission to derive the column density, bulk velocity, and velocity dispersion of neutral hydrogen toward late-type stars in the immediate neighborhood of the sun. The Lyman-alpha profile of alpha Cen B has never been studied at high dispersion, and the derived interstellar parameters will provide an important consistency check with those derived toward alpha Cen A. The value of the HI column density toward HR1099 is important for future observations of its expected strong chromospheric EUV emissions. Finally, analysis of both Copernicus and large-aperture IUE spectra indicate that a relatively precise value of D/H can be derived along the line-of-sights toward alpha Aur and alpha CMi.|Y

A new technique for reducing fixed-pattern noise in the IUE detector will be used for some of the brighter stars in the study. Low dispersion data will also be taken to determine the grain extinction properties, so that correlations among depletions, chemical activity, and grain properties can be tested. The results will provide a valuable insight into the physical conditions in dark clouds.|Y
IMHCI|Ultraviolet Extinction in the Taurus Dark Clouds|Catherine L.|Imhoff|CSC|We propose to study the ultraviolet extinction due to the grains in the Taurus dark clouds, a site of low-mass star formation. Previously published studies have dealt with individual objects in Taurus - HD 29647, a late B star with large visual extinction; AB Aur, a pre-main sequence A star; and HD 23512, a Pleiades star with about 1 mag of visual extinction. Taken together these results indicate that Taurus UV extinction is fairly "normal" but characterized by a weak 2200 A feature, but objections may be raised to relying strongly on the results of any of these stars. We propose observing additional early-type stars with significant visual extinction from the list of Vrba and Rydgren in order to improve the accuracy and generality of the Taurus extinction law results. In addition, we will extend the extinction curve to the full available wavelength range of 1200 A to 3.4 microns, by using their visual and infrared results for these stars. A modest amount of observing time is required.|Y
IMHDY|Distances of 21CM High Velocity (OORT) Clouds|Donald G.|York|Chicago|It has been known for about 20 years that high velocity 21 cm clouds (|v[lsr]| > 100 km s^-1) exist at high latitudes in the Galaxy. The origin of these clouds is not known. They may be anywhere from 1 to 100 kpc from the galactic disk. No mass estimates exist, save those using 21 cm fluxes, assumed distances, and assumed fractional ionizations. The properties of these clouds in other species, such as Mg I, Mg II, C II, Si III, C IV or Si IV are largely unknown. The clouds may be typical of systems in other galaxies. If they are generic to most galaxies, they may account for the large velocity widths seen in QSO absorption line systems. Demonstrating the origin of these clouds (ejecta of supernova explosions, extensions of galactic spiral arms, infalling intergalactic gas, orbiting trash in the local group) depends on determining their distances.  We propose a program aimed at determining properties and distances of these clouds.  1) We propose to determine what ions exist in or around the clouds clouds by observing distant QSO's and Seyfert galaxies that lie in the lie in the direction of the clouds.  2) We propose to study the UV spectra of RR lyrae stars that form ideal probes of the distances to these clouds.  3) We propose to observe objects at a range of distances toward these clouds, on the thesis that rough distances are known once absorption lines at the cloud velocity are seen in the spectrum of an object of known distance (and not seen in spectra of closer objects).|Y
IMHJS|Interstellar Studies with IUE Archives|J. Michael|Shull|Colorado-Lasp|In two observing proposals, we have asked for IUE time related to problems arising from our 3-year IUE surveys of interstellar H I and heavy element abundances. towards 241 OB stars. In this archive request, we ask for support for continuing interstellar studies of the >150 O-star high-resolution spectra that have not been analyzed. Studies of mean hydrogen density Ti, of <N(H I)/E(B-V)>, and of metal abundances and depletions are important statistical parameters for understanding the state of the interstellar medium -- its extent, scale height above the disk, and gas-grain interactions. Differences in the distribution of gas between arms and interarms, or variations in the grains induced by shock processing can affect the reddening corrections to stellar distances, and play a key role in determining EUV/soft-X-ray opacities, radiative cooling rates, and global energy budgets of the ISM. Questions about the completeness of OB stars in recent attempts to measure the initial mass function of massive stars hinged on the distribution of clouds and reddening towards O-stars. The proposed studies will enlarge our statistical sample by 60%, and will serve as baseline measurements of the ISM until well into the Space Telescope era.|Y
IMHRH|Local Interstellar Hydrogen and Deuterium|Richard|Henry|Johns Hopkins University|We propose to use high-dispersion, small-aperture, IUE spectra of Lyman-alpha emission to derive the column density, bulk velocity, and velocity dispersion of neutral hydrogen and deuterium toward 5 late-type stars in the immediate neighborhood of the sun. The Ly-alpha profiles of Epsilon Eri, Procyon, and Altair provide unique diagnostics of the interstellar gas within 5 pc of the sun. The HI column densities toward HR 1099 and Capella are important for interpretation of their expected strong chromospheric EUV emissions. Finally, analysis of both Copernicus and large-aperture IUE spectra indicate hat a relatively precise value of D/H can be derived along the sightlines to Procyon, Capella, Epsilon  Eri, and HR 1099.|Y
IMIJS|Interstellar Studies with IUE Archives|J. Michael|Shull|Colorado - CASA|In two observing proposals, we have asked for IUE time related to problems arising from our 4-year IUE surveys of interstellar H I and heavy element abundances towards 241 OB stars. In this archive request, we ask for two years of support for continuing interstellar abundance studies of the 241 stars plus >150 additional O-star high-resolution spectra that have not been analyzed.  We will derive H I column densities and abundances for Si, Fe, Zn, Mn, Mg, Ni, Al, and perhaps Co. We will compare the depletion pattern of these elements with the theoretical prediction that the interstellar grain population is almost entirely determined by shock processing rather than formation physics. We will also study the 2-point correlation of depletions with angle (for stars within 100 on the sky) to study fluctuations between clouds and intercloud material (a test of the McKee-Ostriker 3-phase model). Studies of mean hydrogen density n, of <N(H I)/E(B-V)>, and of metal abundances and depletions are important statistical parameters for understanding the state of the interstellar medium - its extent, scale height above the disk, and gas-grain interactions.  Differences in the distribution of gas between arms and interarms, or variations in the grains induced by shock processing can affect the reddening corrections to stellar distances, and can play a key role in determining EUV/soft-X-ray opacities, radiative cooling rates, and global energy budgets of the ISM.

IMITS|Depletion in Dense Diffuse Clouds|Theodore P.|Snow|Colorado - CASA|We propose a two-year continuation of our ongoing program of study of depletions in diffuse clouds. We are now concentrating on clouds thought (on the basis of CN data) to have relatively high densities, because in the previous year we uncovered an apparent tendency of certain elements (such as Mn) to deplete preferentially in dense regions. If confirmed, this is very significant, because it may allow us to specify which elements are depleted during grain formation, and which are later depleted by accretion onto grains. We also plan to pursue an apparent relationship between enhanced depletion and UV extinction curve shape, which potentially may tell us which grains are responsible for the depletion that occurs in clouds. Data quality must be high for this study, and we plan to use multiple exposures made with the target stars at varying offsets in the large aperture, so that the fixed-pattern noise in the detectors will be reduced by co-adding the exposures.|Y
IMLAW|Molecular Hydrogen Dissociation Fronts and Red Dust Emission in Reflection Nebulae|Adolf N.|Witt|Toledo|Recently, we made the first IUE observation of radiatively excited noncoherent resonant fluorescence of molecular hydrogen in Interstellar space. There is good evidence to suggest that the photodissociation of H2, which accompanies this fluorescence process, also leads to a strong enhancement of the hydrogenation of amorphous carbon dust, which in turn reveals Its presence by photoluminescence in the red spectral region. We propose to test this suggested connection by obtaining low-resolution IUESWP spectra of sites previously identified by their enhanced red dust emission, with the object of demonstrating the presence of radiatively excited noncoherent resonant fluorescence of H2. Such a demonstration would make available a simple groundbased technique for the identification of H2 dissociation fronts in interstellar space.|Y
IMLDM|Small-Scale Structure in the Diffuse Interstellar Medium|David M.|Meyer|Northwestern|We propose to obtain IUE observations of the interstellar Fe IL MnII, and Mg II absorption toward both components of several resolvable binary star systems in an effort to probe the small-scale structure of the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM). Recent radio observations of the diffuse interstellar cloud toward zeta Oph have revealed velocity structure indicative of clumpiness in the gas. With projected linear separations ranging from 400 to 4900 AU among our targeted binaries, we plan to probe for such structure in the diffuse ISM over a wide range in length scales.|Y
IMLLH|The Pressure of the Interstellar Medium|Lewis M.|Hobbs|Chicago|The work proposed here constitutes an exploratory step toward a better future understanding of what range of total pressure exists in the ISM. The possible role of non-thermal contributions to the total interstellar pressure is of particular interest. We will measure the local pressure in several nearby molecular clouds found at high galactic latitude (HLCs), by determining the relative populations of the ground and excited levels of the ground term of C I atoms in the clouds, and by then making use of the interpretation of those relative level populations developed previously by Jenkins and Shaya. Because these young clouds apparently are in pressure equilibrium with the atomic gas from which they formed, the resulting pressures to be inferred may characterize the more general interstellar medium as well.  This program will require detection limits of ~5 mA for the C I lines arising from the excited fine structure levels in the spectra of 2 or 3 stars; these limits are well below the 20 30 mA typically achievable from a single IUE image. Approximately 8 high-dispersion spectra therefore will be added for each program star. As the increase in signalto-noise ratio resulting from such co-addition is typically limited by the "fixed-pattern" noise of the detector, the flat-fielding technique previously developed by us will be used to remove most of this effect.|Y
IMLPF|Local Interstellar Gas. IV|Priscilla C.|Frisch|Chicago|The low density interstellar cloud surrounding the Solar System provides an optimum opportunity to study an interstellar cloud without the confusion of properties introduced by longer sightlines. The goals of this proposal are to (a) Map the local cloud, including N(FeII), N(MgII), in 15 new directions; (b) Working at high S/N, detect ZnII 2025 absorption in a star sampling the gas associated with a patch of nearby magnetized interstellar dust; (c) Determine relatively accurate Fe, Si, Mg column densities in a star near Capella, thus providing one of the best available estimates of absolute Fe, Si and Mg abundances currently available for low density sightlines; and (d) Search for systematic density dependent N(MgII)/N(FeII) ratios that might be indicative of wisps of gas in the nearby cloud.|Y
IMLTS|Interstellar Depletions and Ultraviolet Extinction in Dense Clouds|Theodore P.|Snow|Colorado - CASA|We propose a continuation of our ongoing study of depletions in diffuse clouds. We are concentrating on clouds thought (on the basis of CN data) to have relatively high densities, because in previous years we uncovered an apparent tendency of certain elements (such as Mn) to deplete preferentially in dense regions. If confirmed, this is very significant, because it may allow us to specify which elements are depleted during grain formation, and which are later depleted by accretion onto grains. We also plan to pursue a recently-discovered relationship between gas phase abundances and the strength of the 2175 extinction bump. One possible outcome of this research could be the ability to Predict extinction curve shapes based on measurements of a few gas-phase absorption lines. Data quality must be high for this study, and we plan to use multiple exposures made with the target stars at varying offsets in the large aperture, so that the fixedpattern noise in the detectors will be reduced by co-adding the spectra.|Y
IMMAW|Scattering in the 2175 Angstrom Interstellar Extinction Feature|Adolf N.|Witt|Toledo|The correct identification of the carrier of the 2175A interstellar extinction feature is of foremost importance for the understanding of interstellar grains. The serendipitous discovery of enhanced scattering associated with the 2175A feature in the two reflection nebulae Ced 201 and IC 435 has produced a new and powerful constraint, potentially useful in eliminating most current models from further consideration. We propose to examine the phenomenon of scattering in the 2175A feature in a new sample of five, previously unobserved reflection nebulae, which have been selected on the basis of greater than average strengths of their 2175A features. This characteristic, coupled with the relatively high surface brightness of these nebulae. produces a high detection probability of scattering in the 2175A feature. provided such a phenomenon if fairly common in dense interstellar clouds. We propose to relate any detected scattering enhancement to the size dependent characteristics of the nebular extinction curves. such as the central wavelength of the feature and the steepness of the far-UV portion of the extinction curves.|Y
IMMCI|The 2200A Extinction Feature in the Taurus Dark Clouds|Catherine L.|Imhoff|CSC - IUE Observatory|We propose to study the variation in the strength of the extinction feature at 2200 A in hot stars seen through the Taurus dark clouds. We have obtained extinction curves for eight such stars which appear to show a decrease in the relative strength of the 2200 A extinction bump with increasing reddening. If this trend can be shown to hold throughout the Taurus region, it may be valuable in improving our understanding of why the 2200 A bump exists, and why it varies in strength. We propose observing several additional early-type stars in order to definitively confirm the existence and generality of the correlation suggested by our previous results. At present the statistical significance of our result is limited by the fact that we have data for only eight stars; observations of several more stars will remove this limitation and should require only a moderate amount of observing time. The additional data will also permit us to examine possible variations in other characteristics of the extinction, such as bump width and the far-ultraviolet extinction.  Finally, this study will permit better determination of the intrinsic flux distributions of pre-main sequence stars imbedded in the clouds.|Y
IMMDM|A Survey of Interstellar Gas Inside the 3 KPC Arm|Derck L.|Massa|ARC|We are requesting 5 US1 shifts to obtain high dispersion spectra Of B stars in the direction of the 3 kpc arm. The interstellar absorption along these lines of sight will be compared to models for the absorbing gas in order to determine whether additional absorption is present inside the 3 kpc arm. This information will help to distinguish between the two competing theories for the formation of the arm.|Y
IMMDW|UV Extinction in High Latitude Clouds|Daniel E.|Welty|Chicago|We propose to determine the UV extinction in one nearby high latitude molecular cloud (HLC) by obtaining low-dispersion spectra of a B3V star located behind the cloud's dense, molecular core. As a class, the HLC's are both relatively nearby (within ~200 pc) and isolated, with little confusion from other clouds along the same lines of sight; they are thus excellent candidates for comparing the emission and absorption characteristics of individual interstellar clouds. Comparison of the UV extinction with the infrared emission observed by IRAS should provide constraints on the relative contributions of very small grains and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons to both phenomena, which may in turn lead to better understanding of the relationships among AV, Iv(100micron), and cloud mass and of what role shocks may have played in the formation of the HLC's. In addition, knowledge of the UV extinction is essential for understanding the ambient radiation field in the cloud core, and thus for the ionization equilibrium, abundances, and molecular chemistry in these diffuse high latitude clouds.The primary star to be observed, HD 210121, is perhaps the earliest type star known to be located behind the dense core of an HLC, and thus may provide a unique opportunity for reliably determining the UV extinction in an HLC. The bright B7IVe star omicron Aqr is apparently located behind a more diffuse part of this particular HLC; we thus plan to compare both high and low dispersion spectra of the two stars to explore the differences in both extinction and abundances between the dense and diffuse parts of this cloud.|Y
IMMEB|UV Extinction Law and CIV, SIIV Column Densities in NGC 6530|Erika|Bohm-Vitense|Washington|We discovered that in the central part of the young galactic cluster NGC 6530 there is a strong correlation between the C IV and Si IV column densities and the strength of the interstellar extinction bump at 2175 A. Both depend on the distance from the star W 93, which is close to the center of the high stellar density part of the cluster. In the absence of any evidence for high velocity gas we conclude that a strong UV radiation field is responsible for the ionization to CIV and for the changes in the UV extinction law. The BIV star W93 is too cool to photoionize CIII, however. An unseen neighbor or companion to W 93 must be the source of the UV radiation.  While the correlation between extinction bump and distance from W 93 is based on about 10 stars, the correlation between extinction bump and C IV, Si IV column density is based on four stars only. The data refer mainly to the southeast part of the cluster and to stars southeast of W 93. We would like to extend our studies to more stars and to different directions from W 93.|Y
IMMJC|Low Density Extinction in the Disk and Halo|Jason A.|Cardelli|Wisconsin|The recent results of Cardelli, Clayton, and Mathis (1988, 1989) have shown that the variability of extinction between diffuse and dark cloud environments is both systematic and predictable and can be understood through a regular and systematic application of relative growth and destruction processes.  Are these results also applicable to environments where a single 'process', such as destruction, dominates? To answer this question, we are requesting 5 US2 shifts for the purpose of studying the nature of UV extinction variability toward a number of sight lines that sample extremely low density gas in the galactic disk and halo where destruction processes like shocks and radiation are expected to dominate. The program sight lines sample a range of galactic distances, 3 kpc <= R <= 9 kpc, and altitudes, 20 pc <= |z| <= 2000 pc.  This proposal will allow us to address several basic questions. What is the nature of '2175 A' bump and farUV extinction in extremely low density gas? Do the characteristics of extinction in low density gas depend upon the height above the plane? Does long-term exposure of dust to harsh, low density environments result in a well-defined, uniform extinction curve? The answers to these questions, when combined with our current knowledge of the nature of dust processing in diffuse and dark cloud environments, will set practical limits on the possible origins of the dust. In addition, these results may allow a single, quantifiable average extinction law to be determined for low density environments, as has been done by Cardelli, Clayton, and Mathis (1989) for diffuse and dark cloud environments. Such an extinction law will have applications to the dereddening of extragalactic sources in the UV which will be extremely useful in the era of UV observations with the Hubble Space Telescope.|Y
IMMJS|UV Fluorescent Background from Interstellar IONS and H2|J. Micheals|Shull|Colorado - CASA|This proposal asks for 6 US-1 shifts to study the UV background produced by fluorescent emission from interstellar ions and H2. A recent Colorado UV rocket observation detected fluorescent emission lines from H2 and atomic ions near SN 1987A, throughout the LMC, and at high Galactic latitude. Both observations and theory predict that UV fluorescence should be ubiquitous in the diffuse interstellar medium and that H2 lines should be strong near sources of intense UV radiation. We therefore propose to obtain IUE lowresolution spectra of three types of sources: (1) two star-forming regions of the LMC; (2) locations in the reflection nebula NGC 2023 (where observed IR fluorescent lines of H2 predict UV radiation fields 200 times the mean interstellar value); and (3) nebulae near hot stars (in which IRAS 12 and 100 micron fluxes suggest UV fields 10-50 times the mean interstellar value). IUE detection of this background requires longduration exposures in regions of intense UV radiation and high column density (which explains why it has heretofore gone unnoticed). However, we believe that it is detectable toward the regions we propose.  The UV fluorescent background is extremely important as a diagnostic of physical conditions in star-forming regions. Furthermore, until the origin and nature of this background is understood, these lines will contaminate long UV exposures of faint objects taken with the HST-FOC as well as long-slit spectra of Galactic objects taken by future missions. Fluorescence line mapping provides a new way of studying the distribution of interstellar gas almost anywhere on the sky, and the line/continuum ratio provides a direct measure of grain UV albedos. Ultimately, the H2 fluorescent emission may provide a tracer of molecular content, star formation, and the interstellar radiation field in our galaxy and external galaxies.|Y
IMMPF|Small Scale Structure in the Interstellar Matter Towards Zeta Oph|Priscilla C.|Frisch|Chicago|These observations study the small scale structure in interstellar matter foreground to zeta Oph. Interstellar absorption features are measured in stars which sample a column 50-150 pc long and 50 in radius. The column densities, abundances, temperatures of the individual clouds are found from these IUE data. These UV data will be supplemented by existing and future ground-based optical data (a proposal is pending at KPNO to complete the ground based data). Stars of spectral type A-F are used to achieve the ability to sample small intervals of space. A key aspect of the data analysis will be constructing synthetic stellar profiles, using a Kurucz model atmosphere, in order to accurately distinguish stellar and interstellar features in the spectra of these relatively cool stars.|Y
IMNCI|The 2200 A Extinction Feature in the Taurus Dark Clouds - II|Catherine L.|Imhoff|CSC - Astronomy Programs|We propose to study the variation in the strength of the extinction feature at 2200 A in hot stars seen through the Taurus dark clouds.

IMOJC|Structure of Interstellar Medium Along Low Density Galactic Sight Lines|Jason A.|Cardelli|U Wisconsin - Madison|The recent results of Cardelli, Clayton, and Mathis (1988, 1989) have shown that the general variability of extinction arising in diverse range of environments from diffuse to the outer portions of dense clouds is both systematic and predictable and can be reasonably understood through a regular and systematic application of relative growth and destruction processes.  Are these results also applicable to environments where a single 'process', such as destruction, may dominate? To address this question, we are requesting 5 US2 shifts for the purpose of studying the nature of UV extinction and its range of variability toward a number of sight lines that sample very low density gas in the galactic disk and halo for which we have also obtained high resolution (4 km/s optical data of Na 1 and Ca II, elements which historically have been used as probes of gasgrain interactions. The program sight lines, which are only moderately reddened, sample a range of galactic distances, 3 kpc <= R <= 9 kpc, and altitudes, 20 pc <= |z| <= 2000 pc.  This proposal will allow us to address several basic questions. For example, what is the nature of '2175 A' bump and far-UV extinction in low density gas? Do extinction characteristics in such sightlines depend upon the nature of the gas distribution? Do the characteristics of extinction in low density gas depend upon the height above the plane? The answers to these questions, when combined with our emerging understanding of the nature of dust in diffuse and dark cloud environments, will set practical limits on the possible physical nature of the dust. Also, understanding the nature of UV extinction variability in low density disk and halo gas has applications to the dereddening of extragalactic sources which is extremely useful in the era of UV observations with the Hubble Space Telescope.|Y
IMPCU|Intensive Multiwavelength Monitoring of PKS 2155-304|C. Megan|Urry|STScI|Our November 1991 multiwavelength monitoring of the UV-bright BL Lac object PKS2155-304, based on IUE, Rosat, and ground-based observations, revealed extremely rapid UV variability, with a possible quasiperiodic time scale of ~ 0.7 days, and for the first time demonstrated a strong correlation of UV and X-ray emission on short time scales. We now propose to extend the previous continuous monitoring with IUE from 4 to 15 days, in order to: (i) obtain well-sampled UV light curves long enough to study the power spectrum in the frequency interval around the suggested period, (ii) investigate the stability of the UV-X-ray correlation over longer time scales and better measure the lag, and (iii) understand the relation between spectral and intensity variability. Simultaneous Rosat, Astro-D, GRO, optical, infrared, and radio observations will be proposed.  The November 1991 data strongly favor the synchrotron mechanism as the origin of the UV-X-ray continuum. If the fast UV variability is confirmed to be periodic or quasi-periodic, it is probably tied to the orbital dynamics around, or the rotation, the putative black hole. Thus the new campaign may probe the very production of a relativistic synchrotron-emitting jet. Since any periodicity is likely tied to the orbital dynamics around a black hole, the UV observations may probe the very production of a relativistic synchrotronemitting jet.|Y
IMPIG|Intensive Monitoring of Spectral Evolution in 0716+714|Ian M.|George|USRA|This project seeks to take advantage of the special properties of the BL Lac object 0716+714 to gain new information about the compact continuum emitting region. Although the standard relativistic jet model is in fair agreement with the time integrated spectrum, mapping the spectral evolution of flares provides much more stringent tests of the underlying physics. Specifically, we will test predictions of the shock acceleration process, of synchrotron cooling, and of the high energy photon production expected from the Compton catastrophe.  The recent observation of very rapid, correlated optical and radio microvariability in 0716+714 implies extremely high brightness temperatures (> 10^15 K). If confirmed, such strong broadband variability poses severe problems for the standard model. Due to its high latitude, 0716+714 is also the only bright BL Lac object for which satellite and solar constraints allow simultaneous monitoring with IUE, ROSAT, Astro-D, CGRO, optical and radio telescopes. We are already undertaking an optical and radio monitoring campaign of this source in 1994 March, and will apply for X-ray and gamma-ray time. Here we request 5.6 days of continuous sampling with IUE to provide coverage in the crucial ultraviolet regime, to probe the emission from the highest observable synchrotron frequencies.|Y
IMPRE|International AGN Watch: Continuous Monitoring of NGC 4151|Richard A.|Edelson|NASA/GSFC|Previous large IUE Seyfert 1 monitoring campaigns have led to impressive advances, including determination of the line-response time scale for the broad emission lines and clear demonstration of ionization stratification in the broad-line region. Because the variability time scales have turned out to be considerably more rapid than anticipated, even the most intensive previous programs still do not have sufficiently fast sampling to allow either measurement of the lag between variations in continuum bands or accurate determination of line transfer functions for the most rapidly varying lines at short delays. In order to investigate key outstanding questions in AGN astrophysics, we propose a program based on 9.6 days of continuous monitoring of NGC 4151 at the rate of one pair of spectra every 80 min. This interval is an order of magnitude faster than that achieved in previous AGN monitoring campaigns, allowing us to (a) measure a lag between SWP and LWP continuum variations, providing a critical test of accretion disk models, and (b) measure in unprecedented detail the transfer function of the most rapidly responding emission lines, greatly improving the constraints on the distribution of the innermost broad line gas. We will also try to measure the transfer function as a function of velocity, yielding information about the velocity field in the BLR. If we obtain simultaneous Rosat, Astro-D and GRO time, we will also determine the relationship between the ultraviolet and higher-energy continua. The continuous sampling approach is both highly efficient, as exposures will be made at a rate close to the highest achievable with IUE (yielding 200 pairs of spectra), and logistically simpler than previous monitoring programs. The daily observations before and after the intensive sampling will probe longer time scales and further improve the line transfer function.|Y
IMPVB|Observations of Interstellar Molecules|Paul A.|Vanden Bout|Texas|Abstract unavailable|N
INOTA|Collaborative Observations of HDE 332077|Thomas B.|Ake|CSC - GHRS|We propose to take a collaborative SWP low dispersion exposure of the peculiar S-star spectroscopic binary, HDE 332077, argued by Jorissen and Mayor (1992) to be a low-mass, rather luminous (Mv ~ 3), and Tc-poor S star with a post-mass transfer A-type main sequence companion. We have obtained H-alpha observations and an LWP exposure, and have found this star to exhibit several unusual characteristics, including broad H-alpha emission with a strong central absorption and a nearly featureless UV continuum, except for Mg II and perhaps Al II in emission. The LWP data can be approximately fit by a heavily reddened A5 V star or a cooler continuous source (accretion disk?) with little reddening, but the A-star hypothesis has difficulties explaining the line spectrum while the disk model has difficulties explaining the mass function of the secondary. A deep SWP exposure will distinguish between the possibilities. This system bears on studies that the Tc-deficient peculiar red giants are mass-transfer systems rather than genuine asymptotic giant branch members.|Y
IONMM|IO and the Plasma Torus|Melissa A.|McGrath|Johns Hopkins University|IUE observations of the lo plasma torus have been made at least once a year since 1979, when the first observation was made simultaneously with the Voyager 1 fly-through of the torus. It is the only data set capable of establishing long-term trends which has been regularly updated and analyzed to provide a continuing picture of the physical state of the torus. It is currently being used to establish possible connections between the torus and volcanic activity, and between the torus and auroral emissions. IUE also currently provides the only long-term measure of the major neutral constituents of lo's atmosphere as well as simultaneous UV observations of both the emissions from lo and the plasma torus. Fourteenth episode IUE observations are requested to make near-simultaneous observations of lo at both eastern and western elongation and of the eastern and western ansa of the plasma torus. Contiguous observations permit deconvolution of the torus E-W brightness asymmetry from those due to lo's atmosphere, allowing constraints to be placed on the degree of E-W asymmetry In lo's atmosphere: they also minimize the effects of torus temporal variations. We have a unique opportunity to evaluate the stability of the plasma torus via changes occurring in Its UV emissions with new IUE observations. In addition, continued IUE observations are essential to ensure continuity and cross checking between the existing IUE data set and the upcoming observations of lo and the plasma torus already approved for the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Linking the HST and IUE data sets will establish an unbroken set at UV observations of the torus beginning with the Voyager I mission in 1979 and extending through the Galileo observations (which will occur throughout the mid to late 1990s) and the Cossini flyby of Jupiter, currently anticipated In the year 2000. HST and recently-acquired Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope data are also expected to resolve some of the outstanding uncertainties about interpretation of the IUE and Voyager data sets, which will markedly increase their long-term value.|Y
IOOMM|Ultraviolet Variability in the Io Plama Torus|Melissa A.|McGrath|Johns Hopkins University|We propose to attempt the first detection of oxygen ion emission from the lo plasma torus in the farultraviolet via its emission at 2470 from singly ionized oxygen. These observations will be undertaken because of the new emphasis being placed on oxygen abundance in the torus by recent spectroscopic observations and reanalysis of Voyager 1 PIS and UVS data on the torus. Detection of oxygen emission would be a major achievement for IUE in its 15th episode, and would contribute substantially to our understanding of the lo torus. A second objective is to clearly identify a connection between the physical state of the torus, determined through IUE observations, and volcanic activity on lo, determined by ground-based IR observations of active thermal brightenings on that satellite. Understanding the variability of key components of the Jovian system such as the torus and how or if they are interrelated is a primary objective in preparation for the Galileo encounter with Jupiter in 1995. As such a concerted effort to observe and connect various phenomena in the system has been made under the auspices of the International Jupiter Watch organization for the past 5 years. Despite extensive ground-based observing programs, the IUE observations of the torus comprise virtually the only consistent data set capable of establishing long-term trends which has been regularly updated, analyzed and published, providing the clearest available picture of the physical state of the system on a time scale of months to years.|Y
IOPDH|The Temperature of Io Plasma Torus Electrons|Doyle T.|Hall|Johns Hopkins University|We propose to observe the Io plasma torus to determine electron temperatures, focusing on variations with distance from Jupiter and between dawn and dusk ansae. This has not been attempted previously because of uncertainties in calculated atomic data and severe blending of key emission lines in the IUE spectra. However, insight gained from high resolution Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope spectra now allows the use of IUE to measure Io torus electron temperatures. Measurements on the east and west ansae covering the same sector of longitude will establish the existence and magnitude of dawn-dusk electron temperature asymmetries. Observations at two ansa locations (5.7 and 6.1 Jupiter radii) will indicate radial temperature variations. The research will achieve the following scientific objectives: 1) measure torus electron temperatures to define the radiative cooling and energy balance of the plasma, 2) verify the existence and magnitude of the dawn-dusk temperature asymmetry and constrain responsible heating mechanisms, 3) establish upper limits for cross-tail electric fields that are diagnostic of convective magnetospheric plasma flow, 4) establish temperature variations between 5.7 and 6.1 Jupiter radii to determine the current radial thermal structure, and, 5) provide a monitor of torus emission in the period preceeding the 1996 Galileo spacecraft encounter with the Jupiter system.|Y
IOPSS|IUE Studies: A Galileo-Precursor Search for New Species in IO's Atmosphere|S. Alan|Stern|Southwest Research Institute|We propose that IUE conduct a sensitive search for Mg I and other potential atomic neutrals in Io's extended atmosphere and torus. This search will also bear on Si I and Al I in the torus, neither of which are presently well constrained. The proposed program requests 2.5 US shifts.  Although no new atomic species have been detected in Io's atmosphere in over a decade, a detection of new species would yield important insights into understanding Io's surface composition, its volcanic processes, and its atmosphere. The proposed search would also have significant implications for Galileo mission planning.  Our proposed program relies on a unique observing geometry to greatly (i.e., > 50 x) improve the effective detection sensitivity of LWP observations of Io. As such, the proposed observations will make the most sensitive survey ever for species fluorescing in the 2100-3200 A mid-UV. The protocol which allows this sensitivity gain is to offset the LWP slit from Io (so that it is outside the aperture) in order to reject Io's albedo signal, and thereby enhance the ability of IUE to detect faint emission lines from the atmosphere. No such search has ever been undertaken.  Newly detected species will provide important dynamical tracers for studies of Io's extended atmosphere and torus by both HST and Galileo. A negative result (not preferred, but possible) would in itself also be valuable, since it would strongly constrain (or perhaps rule out) the oft-proposed sputtering of cosmicabundance silicates as the dominant atmospheric source mechanism, by implying either a thick atmosphere (which inhibits surface sputtering), or the depletion of Mg relative to Na on the surface.|Y
IPJGB|The Nature of the Pulsed Light in Intermediate Polars|Graham|Berriman|University of Arizona|Intermediate Polars are cataclysmic variable stars in which a presumed magnetic white dwarf disrupts the interior of the accretion disc. They are identified by coherent visual and X-ray pulsations of amplitudes as large as 30-40% and typical periods 15-20 minutes. Despite this spectacular photometric behaviour, it is not yet known whether the pulsations arise directly from material falling onto the white dwarf or through reprocessing of that radiation by material located elsewhere in the system. Moreover, the true magnetic field strengths in the Intermediate Polars and their relation to the more well known AM Her systems are unknown, in large part due to the lack of a strong circular polarization in the visual and infrared. In this proposal, we aim to address these questions with a novel observational technique to obtain the phase resolved continuum energy distributions of two representative systems, FO Aqr and 3AO729+103.|Y
IPJRP|Anomalously Weak C IV Absorption in Interacting Binaries|Ronald S.|Polidan|Arizona|A long standing anomaly in the ultraviolet spectra of interacting Algol systems has been the presence of strong N V and Si IV absorption lines coupled with very weak C IV lines. These lines arise in a high temperature region associated with the mass accretion process. Two theories have been proposed to explain the anomalously weak C IV lines: 1) that emission, from a more extended hot region, is filling in the C IV line (filling emission in the N V and Si IV lines is argued to be significantly less), and 2) that the carbon line arises in a line formation region that is deficient in carbon (due to evolutionary and mass transfer effects). Observations are proposed for four eclipsing binary systems that will fundamentally test these two hypotheses.|Y

In the case of intermediate polars. the accreting magnetic white dwarf spins faster than the orbit of the binary. giving rise to coherent modulations at the spin period (and/or at the beat-period when reprocessing on the binary companion star is important).  Although the spin periods can be short. we have recently  used a synchronized trailing technique with the IUE to discover evidence for spin-modulated UV emission in AE Aqr (Pspin = 33s). Further study of these UV modulations is warranted because the pulse profiles and phase-shifts among various spin-modulated spectral lines and continua can help in mapping the geometry and ionization structure of accretion inflows and wind outflows in these systems Several additional systems with spin-modulations in X-ray and optical light are identified as candidates for study with IUE. We propose here to begin a campaign of spin-resolved IUE observations to survey the range of spin-modulated UV emission in the intermediate polar systems.|Y
IPOTA|Coordinated Observations of Interacting Peculiar Red Giant Binaries II|Thomas B.|Ake|CSC - GHRS|During the Fourteenth episode, we began making coordinated IUE and H-alpha observations for the three known interacting binaries involving a carbon or S star as the primary component: HD 35155 (S3/2), HR 1105 (S3.5/2), and HD 59643 (C6,2). Earlier IUE observations had shown that all of these systems are highly variable in the UV and likely involve accretion of material from winds or gas streams from the primaries onto degenerate companions. We have argued that these objects are systems where the PRG primary has not been formed by internal dredge up but rather was created by mass transfer from the current secondary component when it was an AGB star. Complete models of the systems are difficult to determine from archival IUE data since they were taken sporadically. We do know that different emission and absorption lines and parts of the continua arise from different places in the systems. Last year we requested two years of IUE time to monitor these stars over their orbital phases, and received time for the first year only. This request is for the second year. The simultaneous UV and H-alpha observations will help us to locate the line and continuum forming regions, model the accretion rates, and determine the mechanisms of current mass transfer.|Y

In another recent observation (FO Aqr, P(spin) = 1254s), we have in addition shown that for the longer period systems, a method of placing several spectra on a single frame, each spectrum representing the sum of many exposures at a fixed spin phase, results again in detection of spin-modulated UV emission. Further study of these UV modulations is warranted because the pulse profiles and phase-shifts among various spinmodulated spectral lines and continua can help in mapping the geometry and ionization structure of accretion inflows and wind outflows in these systems. Several additional systems with spinmodulations in X-ray and optical light are identified as candidates for study with IUE. We propose here to continue a campaign of spin-resolved IUE observations to survey the range of spin-modulated UV emission in the intermediate polar systems.|Y

IRMBW|Polarization, Hot Dust and Broad Absorption Lines in Iras Qso's|Beverley J.|Wills|Texas - Austin|In our last IUE proposal we suggested a relation between optical polarization by scattering, a 'hot' infrared spectrum (peaking at lambda < 10microns), and the existence of low-ionization broad absorption lines. Our prediction was strikingly confirmed by our recent IUE observations of broad absorption line troughs of Mg II, C IV, Si IV, and Ly-alpha in IRAS 07598+6508 - showing it to be the most extreme of about 3 known low redshift BAL QSOs.  Our prediction was essentially empirical - based on the previously-known relation between significant (quiescent) optical polarization in high redshift BAL QSOs, and the extraordinary optical polarization we have found in several IRAS-discovered QSOs. However these relations are naturally explained.  The model we proposed is derived from the unusually high wavelength-dependent polarization in the reddened QSO IRAS13349+2438 - a disk partially obscuring a normal QSO nucleus, with electrons or dust grains that scatter and thereby polarize a relatively unreddened QSO spectrum towards the observer. This model is like others proposed for polarized Seyfert nuclei, at least some of which are quite IR luminous, suggesting that the observed properties of these polarized IRAS QSOs are likely to depend on viewing angle. They may also provide a link between the most luminous IRAS galaxies that could harbor almost completely dust-enshrouded QSOs, and the most luminous, least dusty QSOs. We propose (i) further IUE observations of 3 bright IRAS QS0s, and (ii) LWP and SWP observations of 4 new IRAS QSOs with 'warm' IR spectra, in order to understand conditions in dust and (BAL) absorbing material close to the QSO nucleus. This will also provide a test of our model, and suggested evolutionary and/or inclination-dependent links with other kinds of AGN and QSOs.|Y
IRNJH|The Link Between UV Extinction and IR Cirrus|John A.|Hackwell|Aerospace Corporation|We propose to further study the correlation between high galactic latitude 60 and 100 micron IR "cirrus" emission and ultraviolet extinction by observing 25 stars in five high latitude open clusters. Our previous work on two high galactic latitude clusters (IC 4665 and NGC 1647) indicates that there is a link between the UV "linear" term and the IR cirrus. When the UV "linear" term is present, the 60/100 micron color temperature of the cirrus is low and the spatial correlation of the 60 and 100 micron emission is poor. When the UV ''linear'' term is absent, the IR cirrus color temperature is high and the 60 and 100 micron emissions have good spatial correlation. We interpret this to mean that the UV "linear" term dust, when it is present, dominates the 100 micron emission. When this component is absent, the observed 100 micron emission is from the hotter grains that normally only dominate at 60 microns. Because the foregoing conclusions are based on observations along only two lines of sight, we need further observations to put the work on a firmer footing.|Y
IRORC|The X-Ray to IR Continuum of PG 1522+101|Ross D.|Cohen|UC San Diego|We propose to observe the QSO PG 1522+101 (z=1.321) from the soft x-ray to the near IR. This object is known from IUE observations to be observable to approximately 550A in the rest frame. Because of the unusually clean line of sight, we can study the shape of the long wavelength side of the "big blue bump" in detail using these IUE and scheduled HST and optical/near-IR observations, while the proposed ROSAT observations will set limits to the short wavelength cutoff of the bump. These observations will provide spectra which can test models of the accretion disk and surrounding region, allow better limits on models of the broad-line region (based on observations of high-ionization lines), and yield measurements of the slope of the spectrum in the 2-5 keV (rest) region for radio quiet QSOs.|Y

ISHBS|A Search for Variability of the 2175A Extinction Bump|Blair D.|Savage|Wisconsin|We propose to use archival data to study the structure of the 2175 A bump toward lines of sight with peculiar UV extinction. Initial results are presented which indicate that the bump width varies from place to place in the Galaxy, but that its central position does not. Should this result hold in general, it would cast serious doubt upon the graphite origin of the bump which is currently the most widely accepted interpretation.  In order to determine if observed differences in the parameters which describe the bump are significant, it will be necessary to establish their measurement errors. We describe how this can be accomplished by analysing extinction curves for stars in open clusters.|Y
ISHDY|How Far Will We See at 500A|Donald G.|York|Chicago|We propose to determine upper limits to H I column densities toward four halo dwarf stars that are more than 1 kpc away. Our objective is to find the frequency of pathlengths through the halo with N(HI) < 10^19 cm^-2. If such low column densities can be found, it will have important implications for design of future Far UV instruments (FUSE), since it means such an instrument should be designed with significant spectroscopic ability at lambda < 912A. Such low H I column densities would also imply the existence of tunnels through which UV radiation from the disk could escape into the halo. Such leaking radiation could easily dominate the halo radiation field: the leaking radiation sets the upper limits to the unknown photoionization rate at lambda < 912A in the galactic halo. Finally, the path lengths with minimum H I are the directions along which direct measurements of the UV background radiation from QSO's, galaxies, or decaying neutrinos should be searched for.  A test exposure taken last summer proves the feasibility of this program and shows that indeed N(HI) toward that one star is less than 1/10 of the value expected for a star at d> lkpc based on the 21 cm all sky maps and the UV absorption studies of normal O and B stars.  We wish to eventually complete 4 stars, preselected from reddening and 21 cm studies to be in regions of low reddening.|Y
ISHEF|A Further Investigation of Extinction in the Large Magellanic Cloud|Edward L.|Fitzpatrick|Colorado - JILA|Five IUE shifts are requested to obtain low dispersion spectra of 23 LMC supergiants to study the properties of ultraviolet extinction outside the 30 Doradus region. A recent investigation by one of the proposers (ELF) has shown that the extinction properties within the 30 Doradus region are very uniform and that the "LMC average curves" derived in past studies are actually dominated by 30 Doradus stars. The several non-30 Doradus stars for which IUE data exist and which are suitable for an extinction study suggest that outside the 30 Doradus region the 2175 A extinction bump may be variable in strength and that the level of the far-ultraviolet extinction may be considerably weaker than in the 30 Doradus region. The non-30 Doradus data may be biased, however, toward regions with higher-than-average dust density. The proposed observations will sample a number of lines of sight through the LMC, and enable us to determine the typical extinction properties outside the 30 Doradus region.|Y
ISHFB|The Interstellar Wind and the Ionization of the Local Cloud|Frederick C.|Bruhweiler|Catholic University|It is known that the Sun is embedded, near the edge of a small interstellar cloud or cloudlet. The relative motion of the Sun with respect to this cloud produces an observed interstellar wind with an amplitude of 410-35 km/s. A reliable determination of the velocity vector of this wind will be a very important discriminant of the ionization in the local cloud. High quality Copernicus data for lambda Sco (d = 105 pc) indicate both a neutral H-I component at -32 km/s and a comparable, predominantly ionized component at -23 km/s. Copernicus and IUE results for stars with d < 25 pc show serious contradictions with Crotchet's interpretations of visual data for six (6) stars, which are probably the result of the greater distances involved in the visual data as compared with UV data that sampled much closer to the Sun. This may reflect global gas motions in the local ISM. We wish to use UV interstellar lines toward nearby (d < 35 pc) B and early A stars to determine the velocity vector of the interstellar wind due to only the local cloud. Since N I column density correlates well with that of H I, we will also obtain reliable N I column density estimates toward the nearby B star, alpha Gru. These results, combined with those from Copernicus, should conclusively determine whether the local cloud is predominantly neutral or ionized. These results will also have definite consequences for the physics in the local cloud and for other currently proposed cooperative IUE studies of the Local Interstellar Medium for larger distances.|Y
ISHJS|Interstellar Metal Abundances Survey|J. Michael|Shull|Colorado-Lasp|We have just completed a 3-year IUE survey of interstellar H I (Shull and Van Steenberg 1984), in which we studied the H I column densities, the "gas-to-dust" ratio N(H I)/E(B-V), and the Galactic scale height towards 241 OB stars. We are continuing with a survey of heavy element abundances (Si, Fe, Ni, S, Zn, Mn, etc.) towards these stars. To complete the survey, we are requesting LWP spectra of 33 stars and SWP spectra of 7 stars. Both spectra are needed for accurate curve of growth determinations. Archive data on 10 of these stars is overexposed. These new observations can mostly be done with US-2 shifts; a few require US-1 time. (the distant, reddened stars).  Our scientific objectives are to study the statistical relationships of elemental depletion with density n, reddening E(BV)/r, location in the galaxy, and spectral type. Such studies can discriminate between competing theories of depletion or grain processing by shocks (look in regions of activity such as Monoceros or Orion). A correlation of depletion with n already suggests that some elements deplete in  situ (within clouds). Theoretically, one may use our abundance survey to find the opacities, radiative cooling rates, and energy budget of the interstellar medium out to 2 or 3 kpc.|Y
ISHPF|Interstellar Clouds Near the Sun|Priscilla C.|Frisch|Chicago|The variety of observations of interstellar material within 100 pc of the Sun have proved difficult to synthesize into a coherent picture of nearby interstellar material because of the paucity of data on the distribution of ionized gas. The proposed program studies the distribution of both ionized and neutral gas close to the Sun. Variations in the ratio MgI/NaI are used to trace out HII regions since MgI is formed in warm gas by dielectronic recombination. Possible variations in elemental abundances, which might confuse the data interpretation, are removed by comparing ZnII and Call abundances. We have already acquired the NaI and CaII data for most of the proposed target stars as a part of an optical observing program. Since the lines of interest here are weak (;<20 mA), a tested technique for removing fixed pattern noise is used. This technique requires alternate observations of the target star and standard star allowing the target spectra to be flat-fielded on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Although some of these stars have been observed previously by IUE, they were not observed in the manner required for this program.|Y
ISIJS|Investigation of the Anti-Center Supershell|J. Michael|Shull|Colorado - CASA|We propose to obtain high-resolution IUE spectra of OB stars located along the line of sight to the recently discovered 21-cm H I anti-center supershell (ACS). This is probably the best example of Heiles' supershells, but its distance and origin are completely unknown. Optical (Ca II, Na I) studies have been largely unsuccessful, but UV absorption is several orders of magnitude more sensitive. This shell is moving at velocities up to -90 km/s and may be an expanding sphere, a ring of high velocity gas, or the interaction of high velocity clouds with the Galactic disk. We will use IUE spectra to study high-velocity ISM resonance lines of Si II, Fe II, C IV, and Si IV. In the IUE archives, we have already found high velocity gas towards four stars situated at one edge. By spacing our targets at distances ranging from a few hundred parsecs to several kiloparsecs we will be able to determine the distance, size, mass, and energy of the shell. Target stars outside the 21-cm shell will serve as "controls".  The ultimate goal of this work is to determine the origin of the ACS. If the ACS is a superbubble located beyond several hundred parsecs, then the inferred kinetic energy of the gas is several times 10^52 ergs, indicative of several tens of supernovae. Alternatively, it has been suggested that the shell is the result of interaction between high-velocity 21-cm clouds and the Galactic disk at 2-5 kpc distance. Through these IUE observations we will place the distance of the shell, its geometry, and energetics.|Y
ISILH|A High-Sensitivity Search for New Interstellar Molecules, atOMS, and IONS|Lewis M.|Hobbs|Chicago|We propose an archival research program to search for weak, previously undetected absorption lines of interstellar atoms and molecules in existing IUE echelle spectra. As a first step in this effort. we obtained in 1982 and 1983 a total of rhoabout 65 useful LWR Images of two program stars. rho Oph AB and beta1 Sco. and a standard star, eta Lup. Using a new method of recording and analysing IUE spectra, we have achieved an unprecedentedly sensitive detection limit (2sigma) corresponding to an equivalent width or W(lambda) < 4 mA (Welty, York. and Hobbs 1986) in a search for the spin-forbidden [C II] 2325 line in the spectra of the two program stars. We propose here to extend greatly the sclentific return potentially available from both the earlier observing time and the considerable computational capability which has been developed for the initial analysis. Specifically, it is straightforwardly practical to analyze most of the spectral interval from 2200 - 3100 A recorded In the 65 LWR spectra. at a sensitivity comparable to that so far applied only near the 2325 line. This combination of sensitivity and spectral coverage may reveal numerous (previously undetected) lines of significance for interstellar abundance studies.|Y
ISIPF|Interstellar Clouds Near the Sun. II.|Priscilla C.|Frisch|Chicago|The variety of observations of interstellar material within 100 pc of the Sun have proved difficult to synthesize into a coherent picture of nearby interstellar material because of the absence of data on the distribution of nearby low density warm gas. Using the fact that MgI formation is enhanced in warm gas by dielectronic recombination, we used the MgI/Nal ratio determined during the Year 8 shifts to locate large regions of nearby (d<40 pc) warm gas. For the proposed Year 9 observations, we will extend the MgI observations to additional sight lines and also observe ZnII to determine simultaneously the electron density. These data are then compared with ground-based CaII (and NaI) observations to complete information on abundances. This program requires LWP spectra (to avoid a fatal reseaux point found in LWR spectra) so archived data are unsuitable. The lines of interest here are weak (<50 mA), therefore a tested technique for removing fixed pattern noise is used. This technique requires observations of both the target star and a standard star, allowing the target spectra to be flat-fielded on a pixel-by-pixel basis.  The ultimate goal of both the IUE and ground-based program is to map out the local interstellar medium. Apart from the intrinsic interest of this problem, it will help define regions where ultraviolet sources can be observed with FUSE/Lyman at lambda<912.|Y
ISIWL|New Probes of Local Interstellar Deuterium and Hydrogen|Wayne B.|Landsman|NASA/GSFC|I propose to obtain small-aperture, high-dispersion SWP spectra of a TRi (F61V, d=17 pc, vsini=93 km s^-1) and a Gem (K1III, d=45 pc, vsini=22 km s^-1 -- two extraordinarily powerful sources of chromospheric Ly-alpha emission. These data will be used to derive the column density, bulk velocity and velocity dispersion of neutral hydrogen and deuterium in the local interstellar medium. Unlike previous IUE studies of this kind, these sightlines were never studied with Copernicus. In addition, the large rotational velocities of these target stars makes them superior interstellar probes to previously observed late-type stars, and may thus plausibly yield the most precise D/H abundance in the interstellar medium.  I also propose to use low-dispersion SWP spectra to obtain the Ly-alpha fluxes of other promising probes of the local interstellar medium.|Y
ISJGS|Small-Scale Structure of the Ism in Orion OB1|George|Sonneborn|CSC|We propose to map the small-scale structure of the expanding shell of highvelocity (HV) gas which surrounds the Orion OB1 association ("Orion's Cloak"). The Orion HV (v < -100 km/s) feature, first observed in Copernicus spectra, is observed only in singly and doubly ionized species. It is undetectable in visual absorption and 21cm lines due to its low column density, and is located in the region corresponding roughly to the area enclosed by Barnard's Loop.  The primary goals of the program are to a) map the variation in column density, abundances, and ionization structure on a distance scale <5 pc of a 25 X 35 pc (3 X 4) region in the plane of the shell centered on Orion OB1, b) probe the the shock structure near the projected edge of the shell toward Barnard's Loop, and c) look for sub-parsec structure in the HV gas along selected sightlines. The proposed observations will be used to test current models of interstellar shocks and the role OB associations play the overall dynamics of the interstellar gas in the Galaxy. Detailed knowledge of the HV shell geometry and inhomogeneities will lead to better estimates of the shell mass and energy, and, ultimately, its probable origin.  Orion is one of the best regions for studying the absorption spectrum of interstellar radiative shocks because of the high surface density of moderately bright B stars, proximity to the sun (d<500 pc), location out of the galactic plane, exhaustive study from the ground (reddening, distances, and membership are well-determined), the lack of high-luminosity 0 and Wolf-Rayet stars which dominate the gas dynamics in some associations, and the low column density of the HV gas.|Y
ISJJN|High-Velocity Gas Toward the WR Stars HD 96548 and HD 97152|Joy|Nichols-Bohlin|CSC|The identification of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars that have been associated with supernovae in their past, and the investigation of the properties of these stars and supernova remnants, would be pivotally important for study both of the source of hot, highvelocity gas in the ISM and of the evolution of massive stars. High-velocity components in the interstellar lines have been observed in the IUE spectra of three field WR stars. We have investigated the line-of-sight to one of these WR stars, HD 50896, and have initiated a similar study of HD 97152. In these cases we have discovered large, expanding shells of gas 50-100 pcs in diameter, which are best interpreted as supernova remnants and which are possibly associated with the WR stars.  We propose to investigate the region near HD 96548, the remaining field WR star showing high-velocity components, by observing nearby stars to determine the distance, spatial extent and abundances for the high-velocity gas. The goal of this investigation is to ascertain if the high-velocity gas in the direction of RD 96548 can be interpreted as an evolved, previously undetected supernova remnant, as in the cases of HD 50896 and HD 97152. We also plan to obtain more complete spatial information for the structure in the direction of HD 97152.|Y
ISJPF|Interstellar Clouds Near the Sun, III|Priscilla C.|Frisch|Chicago|We propose to continue a study of interstellar sight-lines with low total column densities in order to determine the nature (temperature, density, fractional ionization) of the low density gas near the Sun and within the interior of the local superbubble. IUE data, combined with previous Copernicus observations, can be used to delimit the filling factor of nearby low density warm gas, and by default restrict the filling factor of 10^6 K plasma. In the proposed program, observations of MgI and  ZnII(and in one region CIV) are combined with cloud maps and ground-based NaI observations (from a separate program) to restrict gas temperature, spatial and electron densities. The Welty et al. (1986) technique for removing fixed pattern noise through observations of a template star (used to flat-field the target stars on a pixel-by-pixel basis) is used to enable 3sigma absorption line detections at the 6-9 mA level, depending on the number of exposures involved. The ultimate goal of both the IUE and ground-based program is to map out the local interstellar medium. Apart from the intrinsic interest of this problem, it will help define regions where ultraviolet sources can be observed with FUSE/Lyman at lambda<912 A.|Y
ISKBS|Gas Associated with Heavily Modified Dust|Blair D.|Savage|Wisconsin|In the 9th year of IUE, we initiated a program to study the strength, width and central wavelength of the 2175 A extinction bump in a sample of stars known from ANS photometric data to have anomalous extinction. A major result from that program (Cardelli and Savage, "A study of the Fundamental characteristics of the 2175 A Extinction Feature ") is the discovery of the line of sight to HD 62542 which exhibits a UV extinction curve which is the most extreme of any so far found in the Milky Way. The HD 62542 extinction curve has a very weak and very broad UV extinction bump which is centered at 2110 A rather than the normal 2175 A (see Figure 1). Both the bump width and position are well outside the range found for any extinction curve yet observed, including those for the LMC and SMC. The far UV portion of the curve is higher than for any Milky Way sight line for which published data exists. HD 62542 exists in a star forming region of densely packed, swept up interstellar as and dust in the region of the Gum nebula near two stars which exhibit strong stellar winds (zeta Pup and gamma2 Vel). The region appears so extreme that the anomalous extinction may be produced by a combination of shock processing of grains, by grain cogulation, and by mantle growth. In any event the dust toward this star has been so severely modified, it is very likely that the gas phase of the ISM is also extremely anomalous. We therefore propose to obtain high dispersion SWP and LWP spectra of HD 62542 to study the gas-dust interaction along this exceedingly interesting line of sight. Some specific questions we will try to answer include: 1. Are the abundances of molecules anomalous? If the anomalous extinction is produced in a dense interstellar environment either by grain coagulation or mantle growth, the conditions may be favorable for molecule formation. The survival of molecules near HD 62542 may be enhanced by the high far UV extinction of the dust. The HD 62542 sight line may represent the best known sight line to pursue UV studies of interstellar chemical processes.  2. Are the elemental depletions along this sight line anomalous? If shocks produced by the winds from zeta Pup and gamma2 Vel have occurred, then significant matter may have returned to the gas phase at some point in the regions formation. If this effect was significant, then radical variation in the relative depletion patterns may lend clues to the nature of the the gas-grain chemistry.|Y
ISKJS|IUE Extinction and Abundance Studies of Interstellar Gas|J. Michael|Shull|Colorado - CASA|We have recently completed an IUE abundance and depletion survey of H I and five heavy elements (Si, Mn, Fe, S, Zn) towards 261 OB stars in the Galactic disk and halo (Shull and Van Steenberg 1985; Van Steenberg and Shull 1987a,b). We have also examined the correlation of IUE metal abundances with IRAS measurements of infrared cirrus fluxes at 60 and 100 micron (Van Steenberg and Shull 1987c). These surveys are by far the most extensive data base on interstellar abundances and cirrus intensities. Three discoveries of the survey are especially significant: (1) Depletions are correlated with mean line-of-sight hydrogen density (n) but not physical density; (2) Iron appears to be enriched in the gas phase above the disk; and (3) Infrared cirrus intensity correlates with increased depletion of Fe, Si, and Mn. These correlations suggest shock processing of grains in a multi-phase structure and a grain size distribution extending to small radii. Alternatively, Fe may be enriched in the halo by Type I supernovae in a galactic fountain or by selective depletion of Fe onto grains in high-density diffuse clouds. Ultraviolet extinction curves offer the key to distinguishing among these explanations for the Fe abundance enhancements and the depletion correlations.  In this proposal, we ask for 5 US-2 shifts to obtain low-resolution SWP and LWP images for UV selective extinction curves toward selected stars in our data base: those with moderate reddening or lying in the halo (|b| > 20). We will correlate quantitative measures of the extinction curves with n, heavy element depletions, infrared cirrus fluxes, and 60/100 micron grain temperatures to test models of grain shock processing, IR cirrus grain sizes, and grain formation in the ISM, particularly in the halo where effects of supershells and a galactic fountain may be maximized. Preliminary studies of extinction curves for 10 lines of sight indicate correlations of extinction-curve parameters with depletion, cirrus fluxes, and n. These effects are important and need to be checked toward a sizable number of our stars. Although we have high-resolution data on all 261 stars, the low-resolution data is needed for properly exposed spectra near the 2175 A "bump" and at short wavelengths.|Y
ISKRH|Local Interstellar Hydrogen and Deuterium|Richard C.|Henry|Johns Hopkins University|We propose to obtain small aperture, high dispersion IUE spectra of interstellar HI absorption against the chromospheric Ly-alpha emission lines of nearby late-type stars in order to derive the column densities, velocity dispersions, and bulk velocities of the neutral hydrogen along the different lines of sight. Furthermore, interstellar deuterium (DI) may be seen in absorption on the blue wing of the III feature and the cosmologically important D/H ratio may be derived.  Recent ground-based optical observations have revealed considerable velocity structure in the local interstellar medium (LISM), and additional velocity structure was seen in our recent IUE observations. The interstellar HI densities, temperatures, and bulk velocities found through this proposal will provide new information, over previously unexplored lines of sight, about the complex spatial and velocity structure of the LISM.  Some evidence for variations in the D/H ratio in the LISM was also obtained from our previous IUE observations, and could prove very important in understanding the chemical evolution of deuterium in the universe. These new observations will shed further light on the "true" D/H ratio in the LISM and on its spatial variation and therefore may yield more accurate values for the primordial D/H ratio, crucial in testing cosmological theories.|Y
ISKSS|Study Interstellar Medium Surrounding Alpha Orionis Subassocation in Orion OB1:Dynamics of a Disrupted Molecular Cloud|Steven|Shore|New Mexico Institute Mining & Technology|We propose to study the stellar population and small scale dynamics and structure of the interstellar medium of the lambda Orionis subcluster of the Orion OB1 Association using combined high and low resolution SWP and LWP spectra. This region is the center of an expanding molecular ring and the H II region S264, and appears to be the result of the disruption of the parent molecular cloud. We will determine the dynamics and abundances of the ionized and warm neutral gas in the vicinity of the molecular material using some 20 B stars surrounding lambda Ori and compare these results with the dynamics determined for the Orion Cloak. This region provides an unprecedented opportunity to observe the detailed process of the disruption and dispersal of the parent molecular cloud of a star forming complex.|Y
ISLJH|An IUE Determination of Interstellar Hydrogen Columns to He-Rich Degenerates|Jay B.|Holberg|Arizona|We propose to obtain accurate interstellar H I columns to a selection of hot He-rich degenerates through measurement of the Lorentz wings of the observed Lyman-alpha profiles. The resulting interstellar H I columns are of great interest, not only to studies of the interstellar medium but are also critical quantities for the proper interpretation of existing and anticipated soft X-ray observations of these objects. In particular, the simplest analyses of broad band soft X-ray observations of degenerates dwarfs often lead to a correlation, or correlations, between effective temperature and interstellar absorption (H 1). These correlations, frequently allow a wide range of possible effective temperatures. In the case of He-rich degenerates, metals may play a critical role in determining soft X-ray opacity. Inclusion of the additional free parameter of metal abundance further widens the uncertainty in all parameters. We show that an independently determined H I column can substantially reduce the range of models to be considered. In an effort to minimize the contribution of geocoronal Lyman-alpha contamination to our data we introduce innovative methods for selecting observation times that minimize the geocoronal signal and for removing any remaining residual signal.|Y

The velocities of this cloud trace the downwind part of the local interstellar gas flow, These IUE observations will determine FeII, MgII, ZnII, MgI, CrII, and SiII column densities in the cloud, and combined with ground based data, will give the abundance patterns, temperature, geometry and kinematics of the cloud.|Y
ISMAC|Probing the is Gas of the Superbubble LMC2|Adeline|Caulet|NASA/GSFC|Supershells are gigantic bubbles of hot gas, blown in galactic disks by the action of stellar winds and supernovae. Providing an enormous energy input to the ISM, these structures should have an important effect on local gas dynamics, and on galactic halos. Nine supershells have been identified in the Large Magellanic Cloud which, because of its almost face-on orientation and its known small distance, is the best galaxy for supershell detailed studies. One of these, LMC2, has been studied extensively by us using Fabry-Perot techniques, and is characterized by additional X-ray and radio observations.  In order to probe the IS gas of the superbubble LMC2, we propose to obtain high resolution IUE spectra of two background supergiant stars in the direction of the LMC2 ionized filaments. The observational goal is to measure the velocities and strengths of the UV insterstellar absorption lines arising in the superbubble gas, for temperatures between 100 and 10 K. The scientific goals are to find a satisfactory model of LMC2 describing the physical characteristics of the superbubble, and to explore the effects of supershell expansion or break-out on the LMC halo.|Y
ISMAM|Dust in the Small Magellanic Cloud|A. M.|Magalhaes|Wisconsin|Observations of reddened sun in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) indicate that the interstellar grains in that galaxy may show distinct optical properties from those in the Galaxy. In a careful study of three SMC objects, Prevot et al (1984) have shown that the LTV extinction law in the SMC is almost linear with inverse wavelength and the 2200A feature is generally absent.  The first results of a program to determine the wavelength dependence of the interstellar optical polarization in the SMC (Magalhaes et al 1989) indicate that highly polarized objects are scarce. However, the three thus far most polarized objects, AV 211, AV 398 and AV 456, present a wavelength dependence of polarization comparable to that of the Galaxy, but with the following important remarks. AV 456, which presents a 'galactic' extinction law, has a 'normal' value for its wavelength of maximum polarization, lambda max, while AV 398, which shows a 'typical' SMC extinction curve, shows a somewhat smaller value for such wavelength. AV 211 present the most extreme (small) value of lambda max but has not had its extinction curve in the UV determined yet.  We therefore aim at determining, despite the anticipated difficulties, the extinction law in the direction of AV 211. As discussed in the text, such results are likely to have an important bearing on constraining the composition and size distribution of the interstellar dust in the SMC.|Y
ISMCS|Differential Extinction in Clusters and Associations|C. Gregory|Seab|New Orleans|The goal of the proposed observations is to obtain information on the changes in the interstellar extinction curves occurring inside of clusters and nebulae. This project differs from previous studies in that it focuses explicitly on the differences in the extinction properties within a cloud. Star clusters are used because they provide enough target stars to adequately map the extinction properties at different depths in a single cloud. Foreground extinction can be removed by observations of targets at the front edge of the cloud. Changes in the extinction properties require new observations of reddened stars deep within or behind the central part of the cloud.|Y
ISMDB|Spatiall Varation of UV Extinction in the Orion OB1 Association|Douglas N.|Brown|Washington|This program is designed to investigate, using low dispersion IUE spectra, the spatial uniformity or variation of ultraviolet extinction among those lines of sight which intersect the high velocity (HV) "Orion's Cloak" dynamical feature which surrounds the Orion OB1 Association. Dramatic spatial variation, on a projected linear scale significantly less then 1 pc, has recently been discovered in the high velocity components of C II and Mg II lines which are formed in the "Cloak". The spectroscopic evidence strongly suggests small scale fragmentation of the rapidly expanding gas shell. Any spatial correlation between the UV extinction curves and the elemental depletion of the HV gas would have important implications for models of interstellar grain processing in the diffuse ISM. We propose to obtain extinction curves from IUE spectrophotometric observations of all BO-B3 stars in the Ori OB1 subgroups except for the nebular cluster. Roughly half the program stars are represented in the IUE Archive by low dispersion spectra appropriate to this research; we propose new observations for the balance of the sample. Completion of the proposed sample would complement an existing statistically complete sample of cooler B-stars in the same subgroups and allow the calculation of the diffuse integrated UV flux as a function of position in much of the volume external to the dense molecular clouds. Knowledge of the UV radiation field would then allow an search for correlations between extinction properties of interstellar dust and the UV flux to which they are exposed.|Y
ISMDM|Small-Scale Structure in the Interstellar Medium|David M.|Meyer|Northwestern|We propose to obtain IUE observations of the interstellar Fe II, Mn II, Mg I and Mg II absorption toward both components of several resolvable binary star systems in an effort to further probe the small-scale structure of the interstellar medium (ISM). Data recently obtained with IUE toward the binary HR 6952/3 indicates structure on scales less than 2100 AU in the H I shell associated with Radio Loop I. Our proposed observations will determine if such structure is pervasive in Loop I, probe for structure on larger scales, and examine sightlines at high galactic latitudes.|Y
ISMFB|Probing the Local Interstellar Void and the Future of EUV Astronomy|Frederick C.|Bruhweiler|Catholic University|The local ISM consists largely of an expansive H I-free region (interstellar void) which spans 200 pc toward the B star Beta CMa. The actual extent and physical conditions of this region have never been adequately explored.  Two important factors are now refocusing attention on the local ISM and the H I-free region that occupies such a large fraction of the local ISM. First, in 1991, the EUVE will be launched and will very efficiently map out the extent of the H I-free region. Yet, this spacecraft will provide no information on H II and the quantitative results for H I column densities will depend upon assumptions of the intrinsic EUV flux distributions of the detected sources.  Second, the recent discovery of diffuse H-alpha emission both out of and in the galactic plane presents evidence for a pervasive, warm, at least partially ionized component for the ISM. It is generally assumed that the hot coronal (106 K) substrate fills the interstellar void. But, the third quadrant (180<1<270) in the direction of Beta CMa contains several prominent ionization sources that could produce a pervasive, diffuse warm H II region in that direction.  We will probe the extent of the H I-free region and search for both H I and H II gas in this void. We will especially use the interstellar lines of S II in B stars as the primary tracer of (H I + H II) gas, while N I will trace H I. These results will provide constraints on H II/H I toward the third quadrant and on the very important EUVE results. The findings of this study will have definite implications on theoretical models for the ISM and the future of EUV astronomy.|Y
ISMTS|IUE Observations of Interstellar Lines Toward HD154368|Theodore P.|Snow|Colorado - CASA|We propose to obtain high- and low-dispersion IUE spectra of the O9Ib star HD154368 (V = 6.13, EB-V = 0.82), to supplement our planned HST GHRS observations of the same object. The HST program entails a detailed study, at high spectral resolution, of atomic and molecular interstellar absorption lines, but will not provide sufficient spectral coverage to include the moderate to strong lines of important species such as MgII, SiII, SII, MnII, FeII, and ZnII. We will analyze the proposed IUE data independently at first, using a standard onecomponent curve-of-growth procedure, but will later modify the analysis using the more detailed information on velocity structure in the line of sight that we expect to obtain through our HST observations (we expect that this may necessitate a multi-component curve of growth). The result should be one of the most complete and accurate analyses of any interstellar line of sight, applied to a "translucent" cloud expected to contain substantial molecular abundances. The lowdispersion spectra will be used to obtain the UV extinction curve for the line of sight, providing a further basis for the analysis and comparison with other diffuse and translucent cloud sightlines,|Y
ISNDM|The Structure of Interstellar Clouds at the Smallest Scales|David M.|Meyer|Northwestern University|The IUE satellite has been obtaining high resolution spectra of UV interstellar absorption lines since 1978. In this proposal, we discuss our plans to re-observe a number of stars in interesting interstellar regions such as the Pleiades star cluster, the Orion OB association, and the Vela supernova remnant that IUE observed early in its mission and search for variations in the strengths of the interstellar absorption lines. The high proper motion and/or turbulent nature of the selected stars and regions make them excellent candidates to probe the structure of interstellar clouds on scales less than 200 AU. This study will test recent VLBI observations and other evidence which suggests that =25 AU diameter clumps may be common. Such spatial structures could be linked to the complex velocity structure typically seen in interstellar absorption lines observed at very high spectral resolution.|Y
ISNTS|Studies of Dense Interstellar CLouds: Using IUE to Probe Shocked Regions|Theodore P.|Snow|Colorado - CASA|We are proposing to continue a long-term and productive study of interstellar lines using the IUE, in which we have been concentrating on stars lying behind relatively dense diffuse cloud regions. In this proposal we request observing time and support to extend the study to clouds known to have shocked components of substantial gas column density. Previous studies, dating back to the days of the Copernicus satellite, have shown that in such components the depletions tend to be much lower than in low-velocity clouds, but those studies were generally limited to shocked gas having only modest column densities. The IUE is sufficiently sensitive to allow us to make similar studies of much more massive shocked components, so long as the velocity separation is great enough to be resolved by the instrument. We have isolated 5 lines of sight in which this is the case. In addition to determining abundances and depletions, we will also test modern shock-chemistry models which predict that several species should have enhanced abundances in shocked gas; some of these species are predicted to be as abundant as CO, and therefore may be detectable by the IUE. The CO abundance itself will serve as a test of the models and this species is readily detectable with the IUE (as is 13CO). We will use recentlydeveloped line profile modelling techniques, in which the excitation, temperature is a free parameter, to analyze the CO features and any other molecules that may be detected. The IUE data will be analyzed in conjunction with ground-based radio and optical interstellar line data.|Y
ISPJC|The Structure of the Interstellar Medium Along Low Density Galactic Sightlines II|Jason A.|Cardelli|U Wisconsin - Madison|The recent results of Cardelli, Clayton, and Mathis (1988, 1989) have shown that the general variability of extinction arising in diverse range of environments from diffuse to the outer portions of dense clouds is both systematic and predictable and can be reasonably understood through a regular and systematic application of relative growth and destruction processes.  Are these results also applicable to environments where a single 'process', such as destruction, may dominate? To address this question, we are requesting 4 US2 shifts for the purpose of studying the nature of UV extinction and its range of variability toward a number of sight lines that sample very low density gas in the galactic disk and halo for which we have also obtained high resolution (4 km/s) optical data of Na I and Ca II, elements which historically have been used as probes of gas-grain interactions. The program sight lines, which are only moderately reddened, sample a range of galactic distances, 3 kpc < R < 9 kpc, and altitudes, 20 pc < z < 2000 pc.  This proposal will allow us to address several basic questions. For example, what is the nature of '2175 bump' and far-UV extinction in low density gas? Do extinction characteristics in such sightlines depend upon the nature of the gas distribution? Do the characteristics of extinction in low density gas depend upon the height above the plane? The answers to these questions, when combined with our emerging understanding of the nature of dust in diffuse and dark cloud environments, will set practical limits on the possible physical nature of the dust. Also, understanding the nature of UV extinction variability in low density disk and halo gas has applications to the dereddening of extragalactic sources which is extremely useful in the era of UV observations with the Hubble Space Telescope.|Y
ISPJG|The Line of Sight to HD 206267|James C.|Green|Colorado - CASA|This proposal requests an observation of HD 206267 (O6, E(B-V) = 0.52). An IUE observation of this target will allow the measurement of several atomic and molecular lines that, when combined with a high resolution sounding rocket observation (scheduled for 1993) will allow a detailed study of transluscent cloud chemistry. In addition, the independent rocket observation of molecular CO will allow a test of CO determinations using IUE, which has been a topic of some concern recently. In addition to the CO lines, we intend to observe lines of CI, CII, OI, Fe, Mg and Mn. In coordination with the H2 measurements with the rocket data, and HI determination from Ly-alpha (using the methods of Bohlin 1975; Shull and Van Steenberg 1985) we will be able to determine accurate depletions and quantify the cloud chemistry to a level not previously possible. This data will form a part of the Lead-Investigator's Ph.D. thesis.|Y
ISPTS|The Relationship Between Interstellar Extinction and Depletions|Theodore P.|Snow|Colorado - CASA|We propose to use IUE high-dispersion spectra, derived using special observing techniques and extracted and analyzed using recently-developed methods aimed at maximizing S/N, to measure depletions in several stars lying behind diffuse interstellar clouds already known to have unusually low farUV extinction. Our main goal is to compare depletions of selected elements (iron, oxygen, sulfur, manganese, zinc) in these stars with previously determined depletions for clouds having steep far-UV extinction. This will provide important information about the history and evolution of the dust grains in the two types of environments.  A further goal will be to explore the abundances and depletions in the Orion region, where a substantial body of emission-line data already exists. This will help to calibrate both methods of measuring abundances, and will help further to determine whether this region has abundance anomalies, as has been suggested on the basis of emission-line strengths.|Y

During the 17th episode we obtained four new images of this star and noted dramatic radial velocity variations in the stellar lines. This leads us to conclude that Feige 55 is a binary system. Very recent infrared observations show no main sequence companion down to 0.1 M(sun). This leaves a relatively massive degenerate object as the only credible option. The classification of Feige 55 as a binary also has important implications for a recently developed scenario of DAO evolution.|Y

JSNJC|Simultaneous IUE and IR Observations of Jupiter's Sulphur Aurora|John T.|Clarke|U Michigan|In the course of our data analysis of archived IUE spectra of Jupiter's aurora, we have discovered evidence for atomic sulfur emissions from the north polar aurora. These emissions appear longward of 1600 A in SWLA spectra, and are required to fit the reflectance spectrum of the northern auroral atmosphere rather than being directly identified in the auroral spectrum. We propose first to test this identification through long integrations on the northern auroral hot spot with the SWSA in 2 US1 shifts. The higher spectral resolution (6-7 A) obtained with the small aperture compared with the existing SWLA spectra (10-12 A) will be sufficient to separate the sulfur lines from hydrocarbon absorption troughs. We also plan to make these observations during simultaneous CFHT/IRTF observations of the 7.8 mu CH4 and 2 and 4 mu H3+ emissions from the aurora for a comparative study of the IR and FUV emissions processes: the 2 US2 shifts are to measure the auroral brightnesses from both poles as functions of longitude during the IR observations.|Y

JULJC|Jupiter's Equatorial H Lyman Alpha Line Profile|John T.|Clarke|Michigan|This proposal is to observe the line profile of the H Ly-alpha emission from Jupiter at the center of the disk and near the limb to deduce the relative contributions of resonant scattering and charged particle excitation to the production of Ly-alpha. This analysis is now possible due to a detailed radiative transfer calculation that one of us (RG) has recently performed. The Jovian line profile from resonant scattering near the limb is roughly 0.6 A FWHM, since the optically thin wings of the Jovian line begin to scatter the very broad solar line along the long slant column near the limb. This is in marked contrast with the disk center line profile of 0.1 A FWHM, and the broad limb line can be easily detected with the IUE SWSA resolution of 0.14 A at Ly-alpha. The most difficult part of the observation is the pointing, as the limb brightening occurs only in a narrow region at the limb, but we are confident that we can accomplish the observation. The limb line profile will be resolved into narrow (charged particle excitation) and broad (resonant scattering components. We will observe both the Ly-alpha bulge and anti-bulge regions at the center of the disk and near the limb, which will also address the excitation of the Ly-alpha bulge.|Y
JUPGB|Jovian Equatorial H Lyman-alpha and the Ionosphere|Gilda E.|Ballester|U Michigan|An excess of H Ly alpha emission has been a persistent feature in Jupiter's equatorial upper atmosphere since its discovery in 1978. This Ly alpha 'bulge' was found by high-resolution IUE observations to be due to broadening of the Jovian line increasing the resonant scattering of the solar Ly alpha, rather than from a local enhancement in the H density. The line broadening implies that the H column at the bulge is disturbed by a localized, non-thermal process, and two mechanisms have been proposed to explain this: one by the generation of turbulence from strong thermospheric winds or jets meeting at the bulge region and originating in the active Jovian auroral zones, the other involving a superthermal population of H atoms produced by a process analogous to the equatorial anomaly and tropical arcs on the Earth. Some line broadening was also observed in the off-bulge region while modelling of the usual bulge profile does not predict this behavior, but these observations may have been performed at a time of an unusually large extension of the bulge. We propose to make a series of high-dispersion observations (of improved S/N) for a detailed longitudinal study of the line profile which would be of benefit independently of the particular bulge conditions (to be determined with low-dispersion exposures). In addition, new insight will be gained with simultaneous ground-based observations of the newly discovered global ionospheric H3+ emissions. These emissions are diagnostic of the ionospheric temperature and ion density, and have already shown very particular characteristics in the H Ly alpha bulge region. Coordinated observations of the whole longitudinal range should therefore set new constraints on the mechanisms operating in the Jovian equatorial upper atmosphere.|Y
JUPTL|Jupiter's UV Aurora:Energy Input to the Polar Stratosphere|Timothy A.|Livengood|NASA/GSFC|The proposed research will use IUE observations of electron-impact excited H2 emission from the Jovian aurora to investigate the energy input to the polar stratosphere by charged particle precipitation. The effects of the particle precipitation on thermal profile and chemical abundances will be measured using coordinated ground-based observations of polar infrared emissions from atmospheric hydrocarbons. Limb spectra will investigate the partitioning of energy deposition above and below the CH4 homopause at the time of the intensity measurements. A related proposal by Harris et al. will investigate possible localtime dependence which may affect the limb measurements. These observations will be coordinated with other ground-based observers and with HST observations through the International Jupiter Watch. Spectra acquired in this program will be included in our database of previous observations to contribute to investigations of long-term trends in auroral activity and investigations of magnetospheric phenomena controlling the aurora.|Y
JUPWH|Spectrosocpic Study of Jovian Auroral Phenomena Discovered by HST/FOC|Walter M.|Harris|U Michigan|In the last year a new set of FUV observations of the Jovian aurora from (HST/FOC) have emerged in support of the existing IUE archive. While less sensitive than the IUE, the FOC images provide our first look at the auroral oval, on a spatial scale exceeding what has been possible with the IUE. In particular we note the discovery of a region of increased Ly-alpha emission located at ~1500 lambda(III) and 55 deg N. This emission is discrete and lower in latitude than a narrow auroral oval observed in H2 (1600A) band images. The latitude of the H2 oval is consistent with emission from higher L-shells (15-30) than indicated by the present interpretation of IUE data. There has also been intermittent observation of East/West asymmetry in the oval. We propose to address these questions through IUE observations at different latitudes of the apparent Ly-alpha enhancement and H2 auroral oval. The observations would be performed at set offsets from the central meridian longitude to allow a search for possible East/West asymmetry in the emission. There are plans for further FOC observations during HST cycle 3, and we propose for additional observations simultaneous with the FOC.|Y

JURWH|Mapping of the Jovian Upper Atmospheric Albedo with the IUE Satellite in advance of the Shoemaker-Levy Impact|Walter|Harris|University of Michigan|We propose for new observations of the Jovian NUV-FUV reflection spectrum for the purpose of developing a comprehensive zonal and meridional map of the albedo in advance of the Shoemaker-Levy 9 impact event in July, 1994. A comprehensive albedo map will allow detection of collision related compositional changes in the Jovian stratosphere and above, and will enable us to track the movement of the debris from the impact sites to other latitudes and longitudes. We expect this information to provide us with a greater understanding of the composition of the fragments, the depth to which they penetrate, and the energy released in the collision. Because of the long diffusion time scales in the stratosphere, any material injected into the atmosphere at high altitudes will persist for several years, much as ash and debris from volcanic eruptions does on the Earth. By tracking the progression of this material we will gain new insight into high altitude wind patterns on Jupiter. To accomplish these goals we require an accurate map of how the Jovian reflection spectrum changes with latitude and longitude over the NUV-FUV spectral range, which is especially rich in with the signatures of several likely by products of the collisions. The IUE is the only instrument in a position to provide such an albedo map before the impacts occur.|Y

KDKTS|Activity in the Alpha Persei Cluster|Theodore|Simon|Hawaii|IUE observations of solar-type stars in the field show a decline in chromospheric and transition region emission with age. For main sequence stars older than 100 million yr, this decay is exponential from a plateau level defined by the youngest stars. Recently, in order to extend these observations to younger stars in nearby clusters, I have obtained low resolution Mg II spectra for a sample of K dwarfs in the Pleiades cluster, nominally at an age of 75 million yr. These observations show an order of magnitude spread in the chromospheric emission of cluster members. The emission is correlated with the stellar rotation rate, being strongest for a group of rapidly rotating K dwarfs with periods < 1 day and weakest for more slowly rotating cluster members. Significantly, the Mg II emission of the rapid rotators is well above the plateau level defined by the most active field stars and is larger than the emission observed for some very active presequence stars. These new observations therefore suggest that the decay of chromospheric activity with age may not follow any simple law.  A number of rapidly rotating G-K dwarfs have recently been identified in the Alpha Persei cluster, which at an age of 50 million yr is slightly younger than the Pleiades. I am proposing here to obtain low resolution Mg II spectra of a sample of these stars in order to determine whether they also show a wide range in chromospheric emission depending on rotation. Because the large majority of single, late-type stars accessible to IUE are slow rotators, these observations will be important for understanding the connection between chromospheric activity and rapid rotation and their mutual dependence on age.|Y
KDNCA|The Evolution of 10-7 to 10-8 Yr Old K0-K2 Dwarfs|Carol W.|Ambruster|Villanova University|Most of the cool dwarfs in the interesting age range 10^7 - 10^8 yr are too faint for IUE, yet such stars are critically important from the viewpoint of stellar evolution.  Among stars of this age are the Pleiades K dwarfs, some of which appear to be on the main sequence, and some of which are still arriving there.  Over the last few years, we have worked to increase the number of cool stars in this age range in the IUE archives which, in 1988, numbered only 2.  We have since added 4 more stars to the list, and some very preliminary results are emerging.  Now there is an exceptional opportunity to look at more comprehensive questions such as the rotation-activity connection, and the evolution of variablity properties and atmospheric structure for 10^7-10^8 yr old K dwarfs.  We have discovered a small, but important sample of 4 very young, solar neighborhood K dwarfs which are essentially identical in all stelllar parameters except rotation rate.  The stars are all singel, are all between spectral types K0-K2, and all have comparable very high Li abundances, and young disk space motions.  Their periods range from 1.66 to 5.36 days.  Also within the solar neighborhood is a single, K1V member of the Hyades supercluster, approximately ten times older than the 4 other stars (P ~ 11 days), which will provide an important comparison.  Finally, in order to understand the energy balance in the atmosphere of early ZAMS stars, we will supplement the IUE observations with observations at other wavelengths (optical, ROSAT) with the goal of obtaining at least 1 simultaneous atmospheric profile of each star.|Y
KDPCA|Rotational Spin-Down and Activity in ZAMS D0-K2 Dwarfs|Carol W.|Ambruster|Villanova University|TR and coronal spectroscopy of the nearest cluster ZAMS stars, the Pleiades K dwarfs, will not be possible for a number of years. Because the higher temperature regions are most sensitive to rotation, such spectroscopy would offer unique clues to the poorly understood spin-down process in ZAMS cool stars. We have a rare opportunity to investigate the spin-down process, as well as other issues in ZAMS K dwarfs, through IUE observations of an extraordinary sample of 5 Pleiades-age (10^7 - 10^8 yr old), solar neighborhood K dwarfs which, furthermore, are essentially identical except for rotation rate. The stars, whose periods range between 1.66 and 5.36 days, are all single, are all between spectral types K0-K2 V, and all have very high Li abundances, and young disk space motions. These early K dwarfs are on the main sequence, have been spun up from the relatively low rotational velocities of T Tau stars, but are not yet fully spun down. We request IUE time: a) To observe the remaining 2 stars, the slowest rotator, and a discrepant 'twin' of the fastest rotator, in the same manner as the other 3 stars so they can be properly and fully compared, b) Through emission measure modelling, investigate issues related to spin-down, and c) To model for the first time the temperature and density structure of a ZAMS star over a temperature range of 10^4 - 10^7 K using data from simultaneous IUE and EUVE observations.|Y
KDPSS|Magnetic Doppler Imaging and UV Emission of an Active K Dwarf|Steven H.|Saar|Harvard CFA - SAO|Our objective is to determine, for the first time ever, the functional and spatial relationships between magnetic flux, outer atmospheric emission, and temperature inhomogeneities on the surface of an active cool dwarf star.  We have developed and successfully tested a new method, magnetic doppler imaging, for mapping the surface temperature and magnetic field distributions on rapid rotators. We will apply this method to the young, rapidly rotating, spotted K2 dwarf, HD 82558, covering the star with a phase resolution of 0.1 over two full rotations. The second rotation is crucial for separating out the effects of flares and/or active region evolution. The UV spectra will be combined with EUVE and ROSAT data to determine the longitudinal extent and the brightness of stellar active regions from the photosphere to the corona. These surface brightness maps will be directly compared with the magnetic flux and temperature maps to study stellar plage/spot properties, and serve as a basis for more realistic two-component models (quiet +plage/spot) for the outer atmospheres of active solar-like dwarfs.|Y

KGHJL|An Unbiased Distance-Limited Survey of Early-K Bright Giants|Jeffrey L.|Linsky|Colorado - JILA|We propose to study an unbiased sample of early K bright giant stars, including all such stars within 200 parsec of the sun, so as to investigate the evolution of the outer atmospheric structure of intermediate mass (4-6 M[sun]) stars. We will determine the relative frequency of coronal, non-coronal and hybrid outer atmospheric structure among these stars. The range of chromospheric and transition region properties would be quantitatively investigated using emission measure analysis and other modelling techniques. Changes in outer atmospheric structure related to major alterations of their internal structure, such as the deepening of the outer convection zone as the star ascends the giant branch and the onset of He-core burning, would be studied. Using our knowledge about the properties of stars of similar mass at earlier and later evolutionary states, we will construct a coherent picture of the outer atmospheric evolution of intermediate mass stars.|Y
KGIJG|A Search for Chromospheric P-Mode Oscillations in Late-Type Giants|Joseph B.|Gurman|NASA/GSFC|We propose to obtain time series of long-wavelength, high-dispersion spectra of a late G giant to determine whether there is evidence of periodic variations in the Mg II k and h lines (in intensity, centroid, and / or relative blue- and red-emission peak strengths). Periods on the order of 2 hours could be interpreted as evidence for the trapping of acoustic waves - a p-mode - in the stellar chromosphere. We would also obtain similar observations of a K5 giant as a "control," since the latter star, without a steep temperature rise to a hot corona, should not have an effective chromospheric cavity in which to trap acoustic waves.|Y
KGJGM|Extended Atmospheric Structure of K0 III Giant in Binary Al velorum|George E.|McCluskey|Lehigh University|The eclipsing binary AL Velorum (B8 V + K0 III) is a long period Algol-type binary in which the KO giant is not at its critical potential lobe. Ground-based photometry shows that the partial phases of the primary eclipse are strongly affected by absorption of light from the B-star by an extended atmosphere surrounding the K-star. These atmospheric eclipse effects will be enhanced in the ultraviolet as shown by IUE studies of the Zeta-Aurigae stars. This system provides a unique opportunity to investigate the outer atmospheric and chromospheric structure of a KO giant; IUE studies of atmosphere eclipses have thus far been limited to supergiants. We propose to use IUE to investigate this extended atmosphere of the K-star. Low dispersion spectra will be obtained throughout one primary eclipse (208 hours) with emphasis on the partial phases. A few observations will be made just before and after eclipse and at other phases to delimit the dimensions of the extended atmosphere.|Y
KGJTA|Short-Term Variability of Arcturus|Thomas R.|Ayres|Colorado - CASA|Arcturus is the nearest and brightest of the low-mass red giants; a paradigm of the "inactive" stars in the cool-half of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. Nevertheless, recent optical studies have reported unexpected periodicities in the global velocity of the red giant on timescales of hours to days: the envelope pulsations share some similarities with those of the RR Lyrae variables. Furthermore, the B-band polarization and the Ca II "S-index" exhibit erratic variability from day to day, as well as evidence for a 45-day periodicity. Finally, a time-series of the 4.7 micron bands of CO has suggested significant global changes in the coolest layers of the Arcturan chromosphere on timescales of hours.  The recent variability studies have raised important questions concerning the structure and dynamics of the outer atmosphere of Arcturus, and their relationship to the mass-loss process. We, therefore, propose a program, in collaboration with our colleagues at Oxford, to study the short-term (hours to days) variability of important ultraviolet emission features that form in the chromosphere and wind of the archetype red giant.|Y

KNPFB|The Star Formation History in the UV-Bright Knots of NGC 4449|Frederick C.|Bruhweiler|Catholic University|Recent UV rocket imagery shows 22 extremely bright starburst knots in the galaxy, NGC 4449. All are easily accessible and most will yield optimally exposed spectra with the IUE. Only two have been previously observed with the IUE. With these data, as demonstrated with archival data, we can obtain very accurate age estimates for the recent star formation activity using our new population synthesis code that matches the age sensitive spectral features. These fits also indicate an exceptionally flat or "gray" UV extinction for the two knots. They contrast sharply with the extinction inferred from our H and H Fabry-Perot data. For the very compact knots that fit within the IUE aperture, we can by also using our ground-based imagery, determine the actual UV/visual extinction law for the observed starburst knots. This process will yield accurate dereddened UV fluxes and ages for the knots. We have all the necessary tools and supporting groundbased data in place to ascertain how the recent star formation has propagated through NGC 4449 as well as how this activity relates to the largescale supershells seen in that galaxy.|Y

LANAK|Intermediate Redshift Counterparts to High Redshift Lyman Alpha Galaxies|Anne L.|Kinney|STScI|High redshift radio galaxies have the highest Lyman-alpha surface brightness of any known objects, with Lyman-alpha luminosities of - 3 x 10^44 ergs/sec and equivalent widths of ~300A in the rest frame (Spinrad, 1988, McCarthy et al. 1987a, and Chambers et al. 1988). The line emission is typically extended over galactic (or larger) scales, 30 - 100 kpc, and along with the optical/infrared continuum, displays a very interesting characteristic; it is usually aligned along the aids of their associated radio sources (Chambers et al. 1987, McCarthy et al. 1987b).  We would like to observe two intermediate redshift counterparts (3C280 and 3C330.0) to the high redshift aligned radio galaxies with the IUE. Our aims are to search for the strong eztended Lyman-alpha emission, to measure its intensity relative to optical emission lines, such as [OII] and to determine whether the extended emission is aligned with the radio aids. Because of the extended nature of the emission, this project is not possible with the Hubble Space Telescope, which has no has no large apertures for taking spectra over an extended region. Comparison of the properties of Lyman-alpha emission in such objects with the known properties of the emission in the highest redshift galaxies should provide information about how the physical conditions in these objects evolve out to the earliest observable epochs.|Y
LANDT|Damped Lyman-alpha Absorption From Low to Moderate Redshift Galaxies|David A.|Turnshek|U Pittsburgh|We are using IUE archival data to perform a systematic, unbiased survey for low to moderate redshift (0.1<z<1.6) galactic disks. The survey is performed by searching for damped Ly-alpha absorption lines arising in the spectra of higher redshift background QSOs. The damped Ly-alpha absorption lines are thought to arise in the H I disks of spiral galaxies. The statistical results will provide constraints on theories of galaxy formation. The role of this IUE observing proposal in the context of our much larger archival program is to obtain some additional information on the incidence of damped Ly-alpha in the redshift range 0.6 < z < 1.6, where there is little useful IUE archival data. Our proposed 14th year IUE observations have the potential of increasing the redshift pathlength that can be surveyed with IUE in this redshift range by 40%. We propose to observe five bright (16 < V < 17) QSOs in the LWP camera and expect to discover one damped Ly-alpha system. We have requested five US1 shifts.|Y
LANJC|H Lyman Alpha Emission Line Profile Studies of Jupiter and Saturn|John T.|Clarke|U Michigan|In recent years we have initiated a program of high dispersion observations of Doppler-shifted H Ly-alpha emission from Jupiter's aurora, and a year ago we began high dispersion observations of Jupiter's equatorial regions. In Jupiter's aurora there is no evidence for proton precipitation in the form of highly red-shifted H Ly-alpha emission, but roughly 1/2 of the auroral Ly-alpha emission is Doppler-shifted by 40-50 km/sec mainly toward the blue (i.e. motion out of the ionosphere). We interpret this as in situ acceleration of ionospheric plasma by auroral electric fields, by analogy to the Earth. We have also measured Jupiter's equatorial H Ly-alpha line profile from "bulge" longitudes near the approaching limb and central meridian, and detected Doppler-shifted Ly-alpha emission wings on the equatorial line representing a motion in the direction of the planet's spin (~13 km/sec) but at a rate of 40-50 km/sec. We suggest initially that this emitter consists of nearly orbiting (Vorb = 40 km/sec) fast H atoms leaving the exobase: this implies both an asymmetric equatorial ionosphere and also a substantial source of plasma into the inner magnetosphere. In the upcoming year we propose to extend these observations of Jupiter to the receding limb and to non-bulge longitudes, and also to begin observations of Saturn's equatorial H Ly-alpha line profile.|Y
LAODT|Damped Lyman-Alpha Absorption from Low to Moderate Redshift Galaxies|David A.|Turnshek|U Pittsburgh|We are using IUE archival data to perform a systematic, unbiased survey for low to moderate redshift (0.1<z<1.6) galactic HI disks. The survey is performed by searching for damped Ly-alpha absorption lines arising in the spectra of higher redshift background QSOs. The damped Ly-alpha absorption lines are thought to arise in the H I disks of spiral galaxies or proto-galaxies. The statistical results will provide constraints on theories of galaxy formation.

LAPJB|Lyman Alpha Observations of High Velocity Dwarfs|Jay A.|Bookbinder|Harvard CFA - SAO|The H I Lyman-alpha line is probably the most important cooling channel for transition regions in late-type stars, as well as directly or indirectly influencing the formation of numerous other UV lines, yet it is also the least studied line in the far UV. Accurate intrinsic stellar line profiles would be of immense use both as a diagnostic of stellar transition regions and for studies of the local interstellar medium (LISM), and they could in addition be used to determine the total Ly-alpha flux from low dispersion observations. However, the absorption of most of the stellar flux by interstellar material and the high geocoronal background in IUE seriously complicate the analysis of this line.  It is possible to circumvent, to a large extent, the influence of the LISM on the intrinsic stellar profile by observing stars with radial velocities high enough to Doppler shift a significant fraction of the emission line out of the LISM absorption core. Motivated by the success of our previous IUE and HST programs (CSJJB, LGKJB and P2238) that focussed on the giant stars, we propose to obtain low dispersion observations of high velocity dwarfs. These fluxes will be the best possible estimate of their true stellar Ly-alpha flux because the ISM attenuation is minimized, and can be used to determine exposure times for subsequent IUE or HST high dispersion programs to determine the line profiles.|Y
LAPWL|Further Studies of Stellar Lyman Alpha Emission|Wayne B.|Landsman|Hughes - STX|We have recently completed a large-scale survey of the IUE archives for the presence of Ly-alpha emission in late-type stars (Landsman and Simon 1993, 1991). We detected Ly-alpha emission in 227 stars. For 146 stars located in directions of low interstellar HI column density, we were able to correct for interstellar absorption and thus estimate an intrinsic Ly-alpha emission flux. These data were used to establish correlations between Ly-alpha and both C II and X-ray emission, and firmly established the Ly-alpha line as a useful chromospheric diagnostic. Exposure times of archival images, however, are generally not optimized for Ly-alpha, and no attempt is generally made to select an observation time that minimizes the pathlength through the Earth's geocorona.  We propose to extend our Ly-alpha survey by obtaining low-dispersion SWP images of (1) bright Ly-alpha emitting stars for which all existing SWP images are saturated (2) wide binary pairs where the same interstellar HI column density exists toward the two stars, and (3) known EUV sources where the EUV emission can provide an additional constraint on the interstellar HI column density. Observations of the bright Ly-alpha sources will test whether our archival survey was biased against sources with a large Ly-alpha to C II flux ratio. Observations of the wide binaries and of the EUV sources will provide important tests on the ISM model we used to correct for interstellar absorption.|Y

LBFAS|Ultraviolet Observations of Bright Lambda Bootis Stars|Arne|Slettebak|Ohio State|The lambda Bootis stars are a rather neglected group of metal-weak, A-F type stars which are probably related to the peculiar-A stars. In addition to line weakening, they also show moderately large rotational line broadening and have normal space velocities, which distinguishes them from the Population II (horizontal-branch) metal-weak stars. The suggestion has recently been made that diffusion and mass-loss processes may take place in the lambda Boo stars. Since four of these objects are brighter than the fifth magnitude and one is of the sixth magnitude, high-resolution IUE spectra in both the long and short wavelength range may be obtained in 2 US Shift 2 periods. I propose to examine these spectra, compare them with standard stars of similar types, and extract line profiles, in order to look for (1) abnormal abundances, as shown by ultraviolet lines; (2) mass-loss, as indicated by asymmetrical ultraviolet resonance lines of certain elements; and (3) possible line-width (v sin i) differences between ultraviolet and visual-photographic spectral lines.|Y
LBLSS|The Galactic and LMC LBV's|Steven N.|Shore|NM Inst. Tech|We propose to study the ultraviolet properties of those massive emission line supergiants for which infrared surveys have disclosed strong stellar winds and cool extended envelopes. This program will observe some of the best representatives of the luminous blue variable stars in the Galaxy and the Large Magellanic Cloud. The detailed ultraviolet flux distributions are essential physical inputs to models of radiative instability in these stellar envelopes. They also permit the comparison between the UV and IR properties, and the detailed study of fluorescence mechanisms for the IR spectra. Finally the study of long-term spectral variability provides important constraints on models for the instability responsible for driving the eruptive mass loss episodes of these enigmatic massive stars.|Y
LBMBA|Spatially Resolved Spectroscopy of AG Carina|Bruce M.|Altner|CSC - GHRS|Recent high-resolution, broad band optical imagery has revealed a jet-like structure extending 15" out into the ring nebula surrounding the galactic Luminous Blue Variable star AG Carina. The jet consists of two intertwined, outwardly spiraling helical filaments of uniform surface brightness and lies along an axis previously identified with far-IR emission from large, cool dust grains (its optical continuum emission is believed to be scattered light from the central star). The constant surface brightness of the jet is especially intriguing, since it implies possible shocks as the outwardly flowing material collides with the gas in the ring nebula. We propose to obtain spatially resolved SWP and LWP spectra of the jet and at several positions along the "circumference" of the ring. Using specialized software developed for IUE spatial resolution studies, we will analyze these spectra in order to determine the distribution and spectral properties of the dust in the jet, and of the gas and dust in the nebula, and to look for possible interactions between them in the form of enhanced emission from shock-heated nebular gas.|Y
LBMJS|Fo Virginis|J. Scott|Shaw|Georgia|FO Virginis (P = 0^d.776; A7 V + dK) is the second brightest member of a small group of short period (p<l^d) binaries with A to F primaries and G to M secondaries in which the components are very close but not in contact. These stars are of particular astrophysical interest because they are very closely related both physically and evolutionarily to A--type W UMa systems. They may be in a stage of mass transfer which will result in their eventually becoming contact systems. Alternately, they may be W UMa systems which have previously been in contact and now have temporarily become detached from their Roche lobes.  We propose to observe FO Vir with the SWP camera at high dispersion at the quadratures of the orbit in order to determine the masses of the components from their radial velocities. We will measure the radial velocity of the cooler star by using its relatively strong Lyman a emission feature. It is possible to measure the cool star's Lyman a feature with the IUE because the A7 star contributes virtually no flux in this spectral region. Moreover, because of the short period of the binary, the stellar Lyman a feature is doppler shifted away from the strong but narrow geocoronal feature. This permits the radial velocity and integrated flux of the stellar Lyman a feature to be easily measured in high dispersion with the SWP camera, making the IUE uniquely suitable in carrying out this experiment.  Also, we will observe with the LWP camera at high dispersion and the SWP camera at high and low dispersions to locate (a) mass flow in the binary system, (b) gas stream impact regions, and (c) the level of chromospheric activity of the cooler component. The IUE observations will be supported by groundbased photometry to be made at the University of Georgia, Villanova University and the Four College Automatic Photoelectric Telescope at Mt. Hopkins.|Y
LBMKD|UV Spectroscopy of Four Critical LBV'S in Carina|Kris|Davidson|Minnesota|Four of the five known Galactic Luminous Blue Variables (- S Dor stars) are in Carina: Eta Car, AG Car, HR Car, He3-519. Since their spectra vary from year to year, we need updated IUE data on Eta and AG Car for use with new ground-based observations, even though a number of IUE spectra of these stars were obtained in the 1980's. For our highest-priority object, Eta Car, we also need new UV data to insure that a planned ST observation is safe to do. Moreover, there are gaps in the types of IUE data that have been obtained on this star. Since Eta Car is one of the most crucial stars of any type, it is highly desirable to make its coverage by IUE as complete and upto-date as possible. Our secondhighest-priority object, He3-519, has not been observed with IUE; UV observations are needed to determine the reddening and luminosity as well as the temperature. Our aims for the remaining two stars are intermediate between those for Eta Car (a very famous object) and for He3-519 (a rather obscure one). The LBV instability is beginning to be understood, but a successful model will require improved spectroscopic information on these few critical examples; this proposal is part of an effort to obtain such data.|Y
LBNSS|Monitoring the Most Massive Stars|Steven N.|Shore|CSC - GHRS|We propose to study at low dispersion a sample of luminous blue variables (LBVs) and LBV candidates in the LMC and the Galaxy. The purposes are to study the stability and "microvariability" of these stars in the UV with luck to catch one or more of these in outburst, and to provide important information on the spectrophotometric behavior on timescales of several years for the most massive stars in their parent galaxies. The LBVs display violent shell ejection episodes that eject upwards of 10'^-2M(SUN)yr^-1 for many years. They are major sources of nucleosyntheic material (CNO), may play an important role in controlling massive star formation, and offer a site for fundamental tests of radiative stellar wind theory.|Y

LBPBA|An IUE Investigation of the Lamba Bootis-type Stars: To Be or Not To Be|Bruce M.|Altner|Applied Research Corporation|Recent evidence suggests that the SWP spectral region contains several unambiguous classification criteria by which membership in the class of chemically peculiar lambda Bootis stars can be tested. We propose to obtain low dispersion SWP spectra of all candidates whose status as a lambda Bootis star is still uncertain. From the complete sample of confirmed members we will attempt to establish meaningful correlations between the spectral properties (determined from both low and high dispersion spectra) and the astrophysical properties of the stars. Our goal is a better understanding of origin of the peculiar abundance pattern which defines this class of stars, and a resolution of the paradox of their discovery among both young stars in OB associations and Population II field horizontal branch stars in the Galactic halo|Y

LDEDS|Spectra of Late-F Dwarfs & Their Relation to Rotation|David R.|Soderblom|CFA|Several recent studies have demonstrated the intimate relation between rotation and chromospheric activity for G and K dwarfs. However, this relation for F stars is very different from later types in that relatively rapid rotation produces much less Ca III K emission.  The purpose of this study is to examine the properties of the chromospheres and transition regions of dwarfs from F5 to G2 to determine the dependence of this rotation-activity relation on mass, effective temperature and the properties of the convective zone.|Y
LDEJL|A Correlative Study of the Variability of XI BOO A|Jeffrey L.|Linsky|Colorado|Magnetic field measurements of the young G8 dwarf xi Boo A indicate that there are at least three distinct states of the stellar magnetic field (perhaps analogous to solar coronal holes, large scale structures, and active regions), and that the magnetic field configuration varies rapidly. The ultraviolet line fluxes and coronal soft X-ray flux are similarly variable. We propose to continue our investigation of the role of the magnetic field in heating the outer atmospheric layers of this star by correlating the variability of the two. Observations during the past year clearly show variability on timescales shorter than the 10^d.15 stellar rotation period. We propose simultaneous IUE, spectrophotometric, and magnetic observations spanning a complete stellar rotation period, on two occasions separated by six stellar rotations (two months), to search for correlated variability in the structure of the outer atmosphere and the stellar magnetic field configuration.|Y
LDEKH|Stellar Differential Rotation & Chromospheric Surface Distribution|Kenneth L.|Hallam|NASA/GSFC|We propose to continue our investigation of the rotational behavior of solar and near-solar type stars by means of their ultraviolet chromospheric emission.

We especially intend to investigate more thoroughly our finding of slight, although apparently real, differences in rotational rates of different ionically active regions in stellar chromospheres, and of the surface distributions of these regions. The significance of these measurements is discussed in the proposal.|Y

LDETS|Simultaneous Ultraviolet & Magnetic Observations of Three Late-Type Stars|Theodore|Simon|Hawaii|Magnetic fields largely determine the heating and structure of the solar corona and chromosphere, and are implicated in solar activity of all types. Magnetic fields are thought to be responsible for coronal and chromospheric activity on other late-type stars as well, e.g., the dMe flare stars, the T Tauri stars, and the RS CVn binaries. Yet, until very recently, magnetic fields had not been observed unambiguously for any cool star other than the Sun. Variable magnetic fields have now been detected on two stars, both of which also show variable chromospheric emission due to stellar rotation.  In this proposal we are requesting time on IUE to obtain ultraviolet spectra of transition region and chromospheric emission lines of three rapidly-rotating, active, late-type stars, epsilon Eri (K2V), Chi1 Ori (G0V), and 111 Tau (F8V). These observations will be simultaneous with magnetic field measurements from Kitt Peak at several different rotational phases. Our goal is to search for correlated rotational modulation of the ultraviolet line strengths and magnetic fields in stars of different age, spectral class, and rotation period.|Y
LDFBH|A Comparative Study of DM and DME Stars|Bernhard M.|Haisch|Lockheed Corporation|We propose to do a differential comparative study of the ultraviolet transition region and chromospheric spectra of dM and dMe stars. This will be done by identifying closely matched pairs of flaring, emission line dMe stars and nonflaring, non-emission line dM stars, taking the dMe IUE spectra from the now fairly extensive archival data set on these objects, and acquiring new observations for the largely unobserved dM stars; optical spectra (existing and supplementary new observations) will also be intercompared. We propose to address some of the following questions: (1) Are the chromospheric mean surface fluxes always higher for a dMe star of a given spectral type than for a comparable dM star? (2) Is the mean transition region surface flux always higher for the active star? by how much? is the trend suggested by Linsky et al. (1982) for the ratio F(C IV)/sigmaT^4 to increase with later spectral type for the dMe stars, but not for the dM stars, real? (3) Do active (dMe) star spectra always resemble solar plage emission? do quiet (dM) star spectra always resemble quiet Sun emission? (4) Can differential emission measure analysis be used to estimate the surface coverage of active regions in the context of loop models for the two types of stars? (5) Are the dMe chromospheres different from dM chromospheres because they are heated by X-rays as suggested by Cram (1982)? (6) Do the dM and/or dMe stars contribute significantly to the diffuse UV line emission background?|Y
LDFDS|Rotational Periods of Alpha Centauri A and B|David R.|Soderblom|CFA|We wish to determine the rotation periods of alpha Centauri A (G2V) and alpha Centauri B (K1V) by observing rotational modulation of chromospheric and transition region emission lines. In addition we will gain information on surface brightness, size, and longitude distribution of active regions on these stars. A principal scientific motivation is direct comparison of rotation and active region properties on alpha Cen A with the Sun. The technique of rotational modulation has been shown to work well for other late-type stars. Because the exposures needed are very short, full shifts, or even half-shifts, are unnecessary. We instead propose to use 2-hour time slots from IUE maintenance time, which can be scheduled about once per week. This will be augmented by observations during high background time (which cannot be predicted) or during the shifts of other CfA observers. We are requesting time in order to have coverage of the rotation period when the above is insufficient, and to compensate other observers for time spent on this project. No shift 1 time is needed, but 14 shift No. 2 (divided into 28 half-shifts) are needed to ensure full coverage of the rotation period. Scheduling may be difficult, but will be handled by one of the investigators.|Y
LDFJL|Lyman Alpha Emission from Cool Dwarf Stars|Jeffrey L.|Linsky|Colorado - JILA|In late-type dwarf stars Lyman-alpha is an extremely bright emission line comparable in strength to the sum of all transition region lines. We propose to investigate the energy balance in the outer atmospheres of late-type dwarf stars by first determining whether the Ly-alpha emission is correlated best with emission features from the chromosphere, transition region, or corona (X-rays). This empirical result will then permit us to attempt to answer three theoretical questions: (1) Is the Lyman-alpha region heated from below (chromosphere) or above (corona)?, (2) Which mechanism determines the location of the transition region in late-type stars?, and (3) Are major revisions necessary for all existing theoretical models of magnetically closed and open coronal regions? We will use data from the archives and request observing time primarily for very short SWP-LO exposures. We discuss how to minimize problems due to noncontemporaneous observations, geocoronal emission, and interstellar absorption.|Y
LDFKH|Stellar Rotation and Chromospheric Surface Distribution|Kenneth L.|Hallam|NASA/GSFC|We propose to continue our investigation of the rotational behavior of solar and near-solar type stars by means of their ultraviolet chromospheric emission. Systematic time-sequential series of photometrically controlled IUE observations of prominent ultraviolet ionic emission features such as HI 1216A, Mg II 2800A, and others will be used to improve and extend our current results concerning the rotational rates and surface distributions of different ionically active regions in the chromospheres of such stars. The significance of these measurements and the observations and analysis approach is discussed in the proposal.|Y
LDFTA|Capella HL|Thomas R.|Ayres|Colorado-Lasp|The main component of the a Aurigae system, alpha Aurigae A (also known simply as Capella), is a 104 day spectroscopic binary of evolved yellow giants which is extraordinarily bright in the far-ultraviolet region and accordingly has been the subject of a number of detailed studies with IUE. These studies have revealed that the evolutionarily less advanced F-type secondary of Capella is the dominant source of highexcitation emissions from the system, and reinforce the notion that evolutionary "youth" and enhanced chromospheric activity are strongly associated.  Capella HL is a faint binary of red dwarfs which is an outlying member of the a Aurigae system. Although the dM stars as a class are quite common in the solar neighborhood, Capella HL is quite unusual among the red dwarfs since it is one of the very few for which a reliable age is available. In particular, the well-determined masses of Capella Aa and Ab and their evolutionary status imply that the spectroscopic binary is about half the age of the Hyades cluster. Since Capella HL is gravitationally bound to the main pair, it very likely is coeval and therefore as young. There are surprisingly few other dM stars whose ages are known as unambiguously as that of Capella HL, an important exception being Proxima Centauri which is bound to the solar-age alpha Centauri system.  Accordingly, Capella HL provides a unique opportunity to study the youthactivity connection among stars of the lower main sequence. I therefore am requesting a US1 low radiation shift to obtain wellexposed low-dispersion spectra of the red dwarf pair in the farultraviolet and middle-ultraviolet hands accessible to IUE. The objective of the program is to study the strength of chromospheric and higher temperature emissions in one of the very few red dwarfs whose age is known. The study is intended to advance our understanding of the evolution of magnetic activity in the cool half of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.|Y

LDGJL|Ultraviolet Study of the Chamaeleon T-Association|Jeffrey L.|Linsky|Colorado - JILA|The Chamaeleon T1 association is a nearby compact star-forming region which has been extensively studied at optical, infrared and X-ray wavelengths. We propose to observe the brightest pre-main sequence stars in this association with IUE. SWP low dispersion and LWP low and high dispersion spectra would be obtained for these stars which have formed essentially coevally (within the free-fall collapse time of the single cloud from which they originate). Their chromospheric and coronal properties will be studied using emission measure modelling techniques based on these IUE spectra and -the extensive database from other spectral regions. The derived properties of -the outer atmospheres will be investigated in relation to the general propertie's of the stars, particularly position in the HR diagram, mass loss rate and stellar mass. Detailed comparison of apparently similar stars from different star formation regions will be made.|Y
LDHBH|Continuation of a Comparative Study of Solar-Type Stars|Bernhard M.|Haisch|Lockheed|We propose to continue an archival intercomparison of solar-like stars and the Sun; Haisch and Basri (1985, Ap. J. Suppl, in press) recently completed an analysis of fourteen solar-like G dwarfs, and we now wish to extend this to a larger sample using the large existing IUE data base. Basri, Clarke and Haisch (1985, Astr. Ap., in press) examined the scattered light problem in SWP low dispersion spectra. Their results showed that it was feasible to use the - 1650 - 1950 A UV continuum as a measure of the temperature minimum region of a stellar atmosphere for stars like the Sun. In Haisch and Basri (1985) we used 1600 A UV images of the Sun (obtained by a collaborative Lockheed-LPSP rocketborne camera) to estimate the contributions of (1) active region very bright points, (2) plage, (3) network, and (4) cell bright points within the supergranulation to the disk integrated UV continuum as seen in stars by IUE.  The temperature minimum surface fluxes are correlated with chromospheric and transition region emission in our sample of fourteen stars, and all of these indicators of activity are correlated with stellar age in this sample. In one case, HD 1835, our estimate based on T(min) surface flux that the star must be entirely covered by plage-like emission is corroborated by recent observations of Campbell and Cayrel (1984) that - three percent of the surface is covered by starspot umbrae.  We propose to: (1) do differential intercomparison of IUE UV continua of these stars to the Sun; (2) examine the correlation for a larger sample of T(min), chromospheric and transition region emission; (3) check on the validity of proposed power-law correlations among these activity indicators (cf. Ayres, Marstad and Linsky 1981). The overall philosophy of our program is to identify differences in magnetic-related outer atmospheric structure for stars that are photospherically very much like the Sun and ultimately to establish observational constraints on dynamo processes in a near solar-like environment. This is a proposal to continue evaluating and establishing the requisite data base for a carefully selected sample of stars.|Y
LDHDD|Structural Changes in the Chromospheres of M Dwarfs|Douglas K.|Duncan|Cal Tech-MT. Wilson|Recent work by Noyes, Hartmann, Baliunas, Duncan, and Vaughan (Ap. J., 279,763, 1984) presents a detailed discussion of the factors that effect stellar activity. We identify a single quantity, the Rossby number or ratio of stellar rotation period to convective zone turnover time, which appears to be a remarkably good predictor of chromospheric activity. However, C. J. Schrijver, R. Rutten, and C. Zwaan have found from a study of X-ray and UV data that the coolest observed stars appear to violate the so-called Rossby number relation.  We hypothesize that a change in the structure of chromospheres of late K and M dwarfs compared to earlier dwarfs might be responsible. In particular, in may be that Ca II H and K is no longer a good indicator of overall chromospheric energy loss in such cool stars. If so, this unfortunately could mimic the functional form which Noyes et al. identify as being due to the convection zone turnover time.  We propose to Use the IUE to study chromospheric and transition region line fluxes in several late K and M dwarfs. Lines in the visible spectrum (Ca II H and K, Balmer lines) of the same stars will be observed with the Mt. Wilson 6011 and 100" telescopes, simultaneously, if possible. With a more complete empirical specification of the chromospheric losses of such cool stars in hand we can determine the relative importance of losses in the Ca II H and K lines.|Y
LDHFW|Ultraviolet Tomography of the Transition Region of V471 Tauri|Frederick M.|Walter|Colorado-Lasp|We propose to use the IUE to study the radial extent and inhomogenous structure of the transition region of a unique K dwarf. We shall do this by observing the CIV line of the K2V component of V471 Tau in absorption against the hot white dwarf component during ingress to and egress from total eclipse. Guinan and Sion (1981) have demonstrated the feasibility of this concept. We shall obtain SWP-LO spectra by stepping the star across the large aperture. Observations will end at 2nd contact and begin at 3rd contact. This technique will give spatially resolved spectra, with some 5-6 resolution elements along the aperture. One set of exposures, including acquisition and readout, requires ~3h, so these observations can conveniently be done during US2 half shifts. The orbital period is 12.5, so we propose to observe in two successive US2 half shifts to look for short timescale (2 orbits) variations. We propose to utilize one full US2 shift per month for the 7 months V471 Tau can be observed with IUE. This will give an opportunity to study variations of the chromospheric structure on the K star with longitude relative to the spots since the spots migrate by ~40 with respect to the binary phase each month. Hence we may see any chromospheric asymmetries reverse during the course of these observations. We emphasize that V471 Tau is a unique system because (1) it contains the fastest rotating and thus probably most active known K dwarf, (2) it has the fastest migration wave known, and (3) it contains the only K dwarf star that is known to fully eclipse a hot white dwarf star. This program is analogous to those which have used hot stars to probe the atmospheric structure of cool giants in long period binaries.|Y
LDHMG|Profiles of the MG II H and K Lines in Selected Red Dwarfs|Mark S.|Giampapa|Noao|We propose to obtain high dispersion, large aperture, flux-calibrated LWP observations of the Mg II h and k resonance lines for a selected sample of 8 red dwarf stars in the spectral range dK7 - dM4.5. The sample includes 6 active chromosphere emission line stars and 1 quiet chromosphere comparison dwarf. Furthermore, we will apply to arrange for simultaneous, high spectral resolution, flux-calibrated observations of the Ca II H and K lines and the H-alpha line using the KPNO 4m echelle spectrograph and CCD. The resulting data-set will be used to (1) develop self-consistent, semi-empirical model chromospheres with the eventual goal of gaining insight on the Possible atmospheric heating mechanisms operative in the chromospheres of these stars and the relative geometries of the line emitting regions, (2) testing the applicability of specific chromospheric scaling laws (Ayres 1979) to the Mg II lines in these stars, and (3) determine if the Wilson-Bappu effect persists through these late spectral types as seen in the Mg II lines as well as the Ca II and H-alpha lines. We will utilize a fully general, non-LTE transfer code at Berkeley to develop semi-empirical model chromospheres according to the techniques employed by Giampapa et al. (1982). The Mg II resonance lines in M dwarfs are particularly interesting since they are formed at a level between the lower chromospheric Ca II h and k lines and the upper chromospheric Balmer lines. Thus the Mg II lines represent a crucial "bridge" between these diagnostics. Moreover, the Mg II lines are significantly more optically thick than the Ca II lines by virtue of the greater (~ 10) abundance of magnesium relative to calcium. Thus they are potentially a more sensitive test of chromospheric scaling laws (Ayres 1979) for optically thick lines. Finally, an active star and a quiet chromosphere star of the same spectral types (dK7) are included in the observing program as a further test of the applicability of the Wilson-Bappu law to red dwarfs. According to this law, the widths should be identical within errors. Significant differences would be investigated within the context of differences in chromospheric structure which would, in turn, lead to new insights on chromospheric line formation and the Wilson-Bappu effect.  The feasibility of this IUE program has been demonstrated by high dispersion, LWR observations of AU Mic (dM1.6e) of 4 hr duration during a US2 shift (Ayres et al. 1983). We use this result and low resolution Mg II flux measurements tabulated by Linsky et al. (1982) to obtain reliable LWP-high dispersion exposure estimates for the targets in our sample. We will precede each LWP - high with a LWP - low for accurate flux calibration purposes. In addition, we wish to bracket all exposures with FES visual magnitude estimates to check for flare activity. The LWP - high exposures for the more flare active stars in our program will be obtained in segments bracketed by FES magnitudes.|Y
LDIDB|K Giant Spectra for Stellar Population Models|David|Burstein|Arizona State|The near ultraviolet region (2000-3000 A) is a key to the interpretation of the composite spectra of old stellar populations, especially as regards astrophysically-interesting stellar components near or above the main sequence turnoff. Realistic modelling of this region requires a library of standard star spectra for which temperature, metallicity and gravity are well established. Such a library is being established in the optical and near-infrared; we propose here to continue establishing a compatible library in the ultraviolet. These observations will be essential in the interpretation of galaxy spectra returned by Space Telescope and the ASTRO missions.|Y
LDIJL|CM Draconis|Jeffrey L.|Linksy|Colordao|Most current theory predicts that M-dwarfs later than about spectral type dM3 are fully convective. Since the most efficient known dynamo mechanism for amplifying stellar magnetic fields (the shell dynamo) occurs near the interface of a convective and a radiative zone, a drop-off in magnetic activity is expected as this interface disappears (at ~dm3).  IUE fluxes for cool main-sequence stars with known rotation periods,Prot, show a decrease in both chromospheric (Ca II and/or Mg II) and transition region (mostly C IV) fluxes with increasing Rossby number (= Prot/tau c, where tau is the convective turnover time), and with increasing age. Two classical M-dwarf flare stars, AU Mic and YZ CMi, for which both Mg II and C IV fluxes are available from IUE observations, scale with the Rossby number in the same manner as earlier main sequence stars. According to current understanding of stellar structure, AU Mic (dMO.5e) has a radiative core, while YZ CMi (dM4e) may or may not.  The chromospheric Mg II flux from a third M-dwarf, CM Dra (dM4+dM4), also scales in the normal manner. However, both components of the spectroscopic binary system, CM Dra (masses 0.24 and 0.21 M(sun)), are fully convective by current stellar structure models, and furthermore, the system is old (Population II).  We propose to observe the high excitation C IV 1550 line in CM Dra with a deep (15 hr) low resolution SWP spectrum. If the C IV line flux scales with Rossby number in the same way as for earlier stars, then we can conclude either that dynamo activity occurs with equal efficiency even in a totally convective star, or else that the present stellar structure theory of low mass stars needs to be revised. In either case, our result will have important implications for our understanding of stellar structure.|Y
LDIKH|UV Chromospheric Activity Cycles|Kenneth L.|Hallam|NASA/GSFC|The continued operation of the IUE after nine years of service presents a rare opportunity to study the long-term cyclic behavior of stellar chromospheres in their UV emission line fluxes. Our systematic programs of controlled spectrophotometric IUE measurements of cool dwarf chromospheres initiated in 1980, combined with other archival data, has resulted in our ability to determine rotationally modulated flux values for a number of chromospheric and transition- region emission lines for 13 or more stars, over a span of up to 8 years. An observational plan is presented which is designed to provide meaningful new samples of rotationally-independent mean fluxes from most of these stars with minimal expenditure of IUE observing time. Less organized observing approaches would result in more ambiguous data, or consume more telescope time, as demonstrated in the proposal. In addition to our own old and new data, all archived IUE data will also be reviewed and used in the study where relevant and useful, as we wish to determine the cyclic chromospheric properties of as many stars, and over as long a time frame as possible. This longbaseline reference data set and derived results will prove invaluable in designing observations and interpreting results of further studies with the Hubble Space Telescope.|Y

LDJDD|Rapidly Rotating Cool Dwarfs|Douglas K.|Duncan|STScI|We propose to study the chromospheric and transition region emission in four latetype dwarfs which rotate as much as an order-of-magnitude faster than typical young stars of their spectral types. Only one such star has previously been studied with IUE. These observations will significantly extend the regime over which dynamos-the presumed driver of stellar activity-have been studied. They will permit a new and critical test of the so-called 'Rossby number' relationship, which appears to govern stellar magnetic activity.  These rapidly rotating field stars appear to be similar to stars in the Pleiades which have just recently arrived on the main sequence. Some of these Pleiads have circumstellar material and strong stellar winds. Our proposed Mg II 2800 observations should reveal the presence of such material, if it is present.|Y
LDKCA|Cool Dwarfs 10**7|Carol|Ambruster|Carol W. Ambruster|Most of the cool dwarfs in the interesting age range 10^7-10^8 yr are too faint for IUE, yet such stars are critically important from the viewpoint of stellar evolution. Among stars of this age are the Pleiades K dwarfs, some of which appear to be on the main sequence and some of which are still arriving there. There are, however, a very small number of recently discovered field stars in this age range that are accessible to IUE: 2 have been observed, HD 36705 and HD 17433 (observed by one of us); we propose 2 more. HD 82558 is a recently discovered, 7.8 mag, K2 dwarf with a Li age ~7xl0^7 yr and a v sin i of 25 km s^-1 (intermediate between HD 36705 and HD 17433). The second star is Ross 137B, a rare instance of an M dwarf (dM3.5e) which can be reasonably well dated since it is the common proper motion companion to HD 36705 and therefore ~ 2 orders of magnitude younger than the flare stars in the IUE Archives. Both stars are single. The scientific objectives are: 1. to obtain the first IUE observation of a 10^7 yr old M dwarf; 2. to understand TR and chromospheric fluxes as a function of rotation in ~ 10^7 yr old pre-main sequence dwarfs; 3. to clarify the nature of rotational modulation in very young cool stars.|Y
LDKDB|Dwarf Star Spectra for Stellar Population Models|David|Burstein|Arizona State|The near ultraviolet region (2000-3000 A) is a key to the interpretation of the composite spectra of old stellar populations, especially as regards astrophysically interesting stellar components near or above the main sequence turnoff. Realistic modelling of this region requires a library of standard star spectra for which temperature, metallicity and gravity are well-determined. Such a library is being established in the optical and near-infrared; we propose here to continue establishing a compatible library in the ultraviolet. Previous experience with establishing such stellar libraries in the optical has shown that many stars (typically 100) are required to separate out the coupled effects of temperature, gravity and metallicity on strong absorption lines. From 9th and 10th Episode observing on this program, we will have LW spectra for 50 F-G-K field dwarf stars, or about half of the necessary sample. This proposal is for an additional year of observations in a concerted effort to complete obtaining high S/N UV spectra for late-type field dwarf stars of known metal abundance. These observations will be essential in the interpretation of galaxy spectra over a wide range of redshift that will be returned by the HST and the ASTRO missions.|Y
LDKSB|Activity Cycles in Cool Dwarfs|Sallie L.|Baliunas|CFA SAO|Our project encompasses both archival and new IUE measurements. Approximately 100 cool dwarf stars have been monitored at Mt. Wilson over the past 20 years for long-term chromospheric Ca II variations. Many of these stars also have archival IUE Mg II observations spanning the last decade, which we will use to study long-term variations ("starspot activity cycles" akin to the 11-year sunspot cycle). We plan to augment the archival Mg II spectra with new data of several stars at critical phases of their long-term chromospheric activity curves. We wish to investigate activity cycle variations in chromospheric radiative losses (using Mg II and Ca II), magnetic flux (from high-resolution optical spectra) and spot coverage (from broadband photometry). Our goal is to study the magnetic dynamodriven cycles as a function of stellar parameters (e.g., mass and age). The activity cycles are welldefined by the Mt. Wilson Ca II fluxes; we propose to examine the behavior of the Mg II fluxes, at extrema in the activity curves in order to extract the chromospheric radiative losses, which are better identified at Mg II compared to Ca II due to the smaller photospheric contribution. In addition, some of the selected stars have a history of magnetic-field strength and distribution measurements, as well as photometric ("starspots") coverage.|Y
LDLCA|Cool Dwarfs 1o-7|Carol W.|Ambruster| |Most of the cool dwarfs in the interesting age range 10^7-10^8 yr are too faint for IUE, yet such stars are critically important from the viewpoint of stellar evolution. Among stars of this age are the Pleiades K dwarfs, some of which appear to be on the main sequence, and some of which are still arriving there.  Up until last year, only 2 stars in this age range had been observed by IUE, both recently: HD 36705 (AB Dor) and HD 17433. Three more stars were identified by the present investigators and observed with IUE during the past (11th) year: HD 129333, a single, nearby solar-type GOV star; HD 82558, a rapidly rotating, single, K2V star; and Ross 137B, the M dwarf common proper motion companion to AB Dor.  We have since identified 5 more stars between 10^7 and 10^8 years old that are bright enough to be observed by IUE. They are physically associated, but distant, companions to main sequence O and B stars, identified in the survey of Lindroos (1986). Their ages are thus determined by the short main sequence lifetimes of the hot primaries. Rotational velocities are not yet known for our 5 proposed targets; we will be obtaining these and other data in the coming year. We therefore request time for basic IUE observations of these stars, an LWP-lo, LWP-hi and SWP-lo, for each star. This will ensure that crucial basic fluxes are in the IUE archives, should the satellite die in the coming year. Furthermore these data are immediately useful in filling the gap in the exhaustive study by Simon, Herbig and Boesgaard (1985) of the evolution of TR and chromospheric activity with age. More in-depth coverage will be proposed next year.|Y
LDMGB|Observations of Photospheric Activity in Cool Dwarfs|Gibor S.|Basri|UC Berkeley|IUE spectra have been used to greatly enhance the information on stellar chromospheric activity compared with ground-based observations. This is because the brightness contrast between the hot chromosphere and the cooler photosphere is substantially larger in the ultraviolet than in the optical. The same advantage can be used in the analysis of photospheric activity nonradiative heating of the upper photosphere), which has received scant attention to date, due to the extreme subtlety of its observational consequences in the optical. Nevertheless, a majority of the nonradiative heating of stellar atmospheres occurs in the upper photosphere, not the chromosphere. We propose a differential analysis of ultraviolet absorption lines in active and inactive cool dwarfs of the same spectral type, using high dispersion IUE spectra. This should allow assessment of whether sources of heating are the same at photospheric and chromospheric levels, and clarify the role of acoustic waves. Adequate IUE spectra of active stars already exist, but observations of inactive stars are very sparse, and more are needed for a meaningful differential analysis.|Y
LDMTS|The Evolution of Chromospheric Activity of Solar Mass Stars|Theodore|Simon|Hawaii|Stars of about 1 M(sun) in the young Alpha Persei cluster rotate many times faster than stars of identical mass in older clusters or in the field. This rapid rotation apparently decays to much slower rates on time scales of only 50 Myr or less since G dwarfs in the slightly older Pleiades cluster are all relatively slow rotators. The time scale required for this spindown is very much shorter than what is implied by simple magnetic braking laws. It seems likely from this and other considerations that stellar dynamos must be governed by a feedback mechanism, which controls both the amount of chromosphericcoronal heating and the rate at which angular momentum is lost. The purpose of this proposal is to try to understand this mechanism by exploring the connection between the time decay of rotation and the time decay of chromospheric activity. I am proposing to observe the chromospheric lines of Mg II for a small sample of 1 M(sun). Stars in the Alpha Persei and Pleiades clusters. To separate the line emission from the stellar continuum, the observations must be made at echelle dispersion, and because the stars are relatively faint for IUE,  full shift exposures are required. These observations will provide an extremely valuable comparison with measurements planned for the hightemperature transition region lines of C II, Si IV, and C IV to be undertaken as part of an accepted G.O. program with the Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph aboard the Hubble Space Telescope. By combining the Mg II observations made by IUE with observations possible only from HST, it may be possible to gauge the sensitivity of dynamo activity to rotation (and age) within very different layers of the stellar atmosphere. The mass dependence of this sensitivity can also be examined from a comparison of these new Mg II data with existing IUE data for young K-M stars.|Y

LEGCS|Beryllium in Peculiar G-K Giant Stars|Christopher|Sneden|Texas|Beryllium abundances will be derived for a number of G-K giants, using spectrum synthesis of the Be II lines near 3130 A. Observational data will consist of IUE long wavelength high resolution spectra, obtained both from the archives for standard giant stars, and from new observations of selected peculiar giants. In particular, we will request observing time to gather spectra of stars which have anomalously strong Li I features at 6707 A. The derived Be abundances in these stars will be correlated with other light element (Li, C, N, and O) abundances in an attempt to explain the causes of the Li anomalies. The Be abundances should enable us to rule for or against such theoretical ideas as element segregation, delayed onset of convection in giant star envelopes, and. post-main sequence Li production in highly evolved stars.  In a related secondary project, we will use high resolution spectra from the IUE archives to look for Be abundance variations in F-K main sequence stars. This study will seek to define more clearly the HR diagram limits of the unevolved Bedeficient stars.|Y
LEGTS|Chromospheres and Light Element Abundances|Theodore|Simon|Hawaii|Observations show a decline in surface lithium content of 1 M(sun) stars during their main sequence lifetimes. This is explained by models of stellar evolution as the result of convective mixing with the interior: surface material is mixed into deeper layers, T > 2 million K, where Li is destroyed by nuclear reactions. The models predict little depletion for stars more massive than the Sun, that is, for the early- and mid-F stars. Moreover, the abundance of beryllium should remain at its primordial level for all stars hotter than K2. Some nearby F dwarfs are known to have very low abundances of Li and Be, with depletions of more than an order of magnitude. These abundance peculiarities have been attributed to the action of turbulent diffusion (rather than gravitational settling). I am proposing here to look for evidence of chromospheric effects in the UV spectra of stars with different Li and Be abundances. A correlation between variations in chromospheric (and transition region) emission and light element depletions would suggest a common origin for both, arising out of differences in internal structure, differential rotation, or turbulence spectrum from one star to the next.|Y
LEORP|Multiwavelength Study of 17 Leporis|Ronald S.|Polidan|NASA/GSFC|The binary system 17 Lep (B9V+MlIII)) has been called an A2 shell star, a symbiotic star, and an interacting binary system. It is a bright IRAS source with a good LRS spectrum and detectable fluxes out to 1001 microns. The ultraviolet spectrum of 17 Lep is strongly absorbed out by a dense aggregate of iron peak lines (an "Fe-curtain") that virtually obliterate the spectrum of the B9 star. Two P Cyg emission lines are seen in the UV spectrum of 17Lep: Ly-alpha 1215 and MgII 2800. We propose to obtain high resolution observations scattered over the 260 day orbit of 17 Lep that is accessible during the 15t' year of IUE with emphasis on the periastron and post periastron portion (January-March 93) to study Ly-alpha and Fe-curtain variations to better understand geometrical and physical properties of the system and, ultimately, to refine the model of the binary. These observations are the UV portion of a coordinated multiwavelength study of 17 Lep begun this observing season at optical and UV wavelengths to improve our understanding of this binary system and resolve its evolutionary state.|Y

LGDTS|A Study of Transition Region Properties in Yellow Giants|Theodore|Simon|Hawaii|In our previous observing programs with IUE and Einstein we have found that the cool half of the HR diagram can be divided roughly into two regions with a "dividing line" roughly vertical through spectral type K2 III. To the left, the yellow giants generally show evidence for chromospheres, transition regions, coronae, and weak winds. To the right, the red giants and supergiants show evidence for chromospheres and massive cool winds, but no evidence for material hotter than 10 K. We now realize that this picture is too simple. One important complication is that the yellow giants, on the basis of a few spectra, appear to show a wide range of transition region emission line strengths. It is the goal of this proposal to determine the range of these emission line strengths by deep SWP low dispersion spectra and high dispersion Mg II spectra, and to try to understand the basis of this range. We propose to compute models for the chromospheres and transition-regions of representative stars to determine the range of pressures and densities in the outer atmospheres of yellow giants. These parameters will then be compared with the available X-ray, He 10830, and rotation data. One possible explanation, which we will try to verify or reject, is that the yellow giants with bright emission lines are 2-3 M(sun) stars which have only recently left the main sequence and are rapid rotators, whereas the weak emission line stars may be more evolved stars now returning from the red giant branch as slow rotators.|Y
LGEEB|Chromospheres & White Dwarf Companions of Peculiar Abundance Stars|Erika|Bohm-Vitense|Washington|It is proposed to continue to observe chromospheres and transition region emission of stars with peculiar element abundances. At the same time we want to continue the search for white dwarf companions of these stars.  Since the studies of McClure et al. 1980 it is suspected that many if not all of the peculiar element abundance stars have white dwarf companions and that mass exchange has led to the exposure of the deeper layers of the stars in which peculiar abundances have been generated by nuclear reactions. This would especially explain the large nitrogen abundance and may explain the large Li abundance seen in weak G band stars, and the large C abundance seen in CH stars.  While cool white dwarf companions may be too faint to be visible an active chromosphere may still indicate their presence. A study of the relative emission line intensities will confirm the peculiar element abundances and exclude peculiar surface temperature stratifications as a possible explanation for anomalous molecular line intensities.|Y
LGESB|Activity in the Hyades Giants|Sallie L.|Baliunas|CFA|The giant stars In the Hyades present a well-studied group of stars of spectral type KO Ill. Their optical properties are quite similar, If not Identical. All appear to be slow rotators. Yet their chromospherIc and coronal emission Is different one from the other, by more than a factor of ten. We conjecture that this disparity results from different activity cycles - much as Is present In dwarf stars. We propose to reobserve these giants to search for variability on a three year time scale.|Y
LGETS|Ultraviolet Observations of Young Giant Stars|Theodore|Simon|Hawaii|Ultraviolet spectra obtained with IUE have established that the cool half of the HR diagram can be divided into two regions, with a "dividing line" roughly vertical through spectral type K2III. To the left, yellow giants earlier than K2III generally show evidence for chromospheres, transition regions, coronae, and weak winds. To the right, the red giants and supergiants show spectroscopic evidence for chromospheres and cool winds, but no evidence for material hotter than 10^4 K. It is the goal of this proposal to determine whether a "dividing line" also exists near the blue edge of the Hertzsprung Gap, coinciding with the onset of stellar convection zones. A previous study by Bohm-Vitense and Dettmann included three F5 II-III stars, and none showed evidence of high temperature lines indicative of hot transition regions and chromospheres. A related goal is to understand the observed wide range of transition region line strengths of the yellow giants (GS-8 III). One possible explanation, which I will try to verify or reject, is that yellow giants with bright emission lines are 23 M(sun) stars which have only recently left the main sequence and are rapid rotators. The stars selected for observation are late F and early G giants, which are crossing the Hertzsprung Gap for the first time. They are judged to be young on the basis of having high Li content. I propose to compare these new data with archival spectra of F-G giants, and with available Xray and rotation data.|Y
LGFDM|Statistics of Mass Loss Fluctuations in Cool Giants|Dermott J.|Mullan|Delaware|We propose to undertake a statistical study of fluctuations in mass loss processes in cool giant stars using the IUE archival data base. The primary tool for the study will be high dispersion profiles of the Mg II h and k lines, both their emission components as well as their associated absorption components due to circumstellar effects. In the IUE archives at present, there exist high dispersion LWR spectra for at least 60-70 stars of spectral types G, K, M, and luminosity classes IIV. The total number of high dispersion LWR spectra for these target stars exceeds 300 at present, and this number is continually increasing. Thus, a significant sample exists already for purposes of statistical study: the sample is much larger than that which was used previously in an exploratory study of variability among such stars. Moreover, since the time of the exploratory study, the IUE RDAF has come on line at Goddard Space Flight Center, and this allows one to subject IUE data to a more homogeneous and systematic analysis than has hitherto been possible in a statistical survey of this kind. The statistical properties of various spectroscopic features in these stars (especially correlations between fluctuations in lines formed at various levels of the atmosphere, from chromosphere to transition region to corona to circumstellar cloud) are expected to hold an important key to understanding the mechanism (or mechanisms) by means of which cool giants lose mass. The purpose of the present proposal is to begin to define those statistical properties in order to lay foundations for future theoretical work on the mass loss mechanism(s).|Y
LGFEB|White Dwarf Companions and Chromospheres of Stars with Peculiar Element Abundances|Erika|Bohm-Vitense|U Washington|During our studies of BaII and mild Ba stars we found 3 hot companions. An additional one was found by Schindler, et al. With these 4 cases we can start to do some preliminary statistics in order to guide us with further observations.  We find that the Ba stars With companions have all been classified as luminosity class II or higher. We also find that 3 of the 4 have late G spectral types while most of the Ba stars have K types. Also, 3 of the 4 are mild Ba stars. They are, however, not the same 3 stars. We would like to check whether these correlations persist in further studies. Several mild Ba stars are fairly bright. For these we may have a good chance to see the companions. We would therefore like to observe preferentially mild Ba stars with G spectral classification and luminosity class 11 or higher. If the frequency of companions for these stars is indeed high, we may find enough to study the relation between companion temperatures and the properties of the peculiar abundance stars.|Y
LGFJL|High Dispersion Study of Luminous Cool Stars|Jeffrey L.|Linsky|Colorado - JILA|We propose to obtain 16-20 hour high dispersion SWP spectra, as well as high dispersion LWR spectra, of four late-type giants. The targets are Alpha Her (M5 II + G5 III), Zeta Cyg (G8 III, Ba 0.6), Beta Peg (M2.5 II-III) and Beta And (MO IIIa). The observations of Alpha Her will extend our understanding of stellar winds, circumstellar material and binary interaction in cool stellar atmospheres. The existence of the hotter secondary star (actually a spectroscopic binary) provides a unique opportunity for studying the circumstellar material in absorption far into the ultraviolet. The observations of Zeta Cygni should present further evidence for s-enriched material in the stellar atmosphere and in the circumstellar gas and may give new information on the probable compact companion of the star and the interaction between the two components of the system. The observations of Beta Peg and Beta And should increase our knowledge dramatically as regards the dynamical state of chromospheres of M giants and lead to interesting conclusions when compared with the corresponding observations of the M supergiant Alpha Ori, and the dMe star AU Mic.|Y
LGFRH|Chromospheric Activity TIO Strength and Spectral Types in M Giants|R. Kent|Honeycutt|Indiana University|The IUE satellite will be used to study the ultraviolet spectra of cool giant stars that have well determined angular diameters and effective temperatures. The stars to be observed have spectral classes ranging from F5 through M6 and are of luminosity class III. Low resolution observations in the long wavelength region will be made in order to study the photospheric continuum radiation in the UV and to determine the level of chromospheric activity in these stars. The absolute flux as well as the slope of the continuum in the wavelength region 22003000 A should be a sensitive probe of the extent of non-radiative heating in the upper photosphere. Chromospheric activity will be examined for the range of spectral subclasses observed to determine if the degree of chromospheric activity differs for stars of the same effective temperature. The possibility exists that such a differential level of chromospheric activity could lead to the inhibition of TiO formation in the upper photosphere. This possibility will be examined along with the resultant consequences for comparisons of observed TiO bandstrengths with model predictions.|Y
LGFSB|Vertical Structure of the Atmospheres of Active G-Giant Stars|Sallie L.|Baliunas|CFA|Two G8 giants in binary systems present a unique opportunity to measure the vertical scale height of emitting regions through the extended atmospheres of these stars. For lambda And, geometrically extended regions will be mapped as an active area which either appears or disappears over the stellar limb. In FF Aqr, the hot, sdO binary companion will be used to probe geometrically-extended inhomogeneities during eclipse through the late-type giant atmosphere.  Study of the similarities and differences between atmospheric inhomogeneities as a function of temperature and height may reveal separable data on localized "active" areas, compared to non-localized background emission. With a comparison of these two stars with ostensibly similar photospheres but widely different rotation rates we hope to investigate the interplay of rotation with the coronal structure and coronal heating rates.|Y
LGFTA|High-Dispersion Observations of Alpha Bootis|Thomas R.|Ayres|Colorado-Lasp|Investigating the late phases of the life of a star is central to an understanding of stellar structure and evolution, and the aping of stellar magnetic activity. For yellow dwarf stars like the Sun, the advanced stages of their life cycle are represented by old red giants like Arcturus (alpha  Bootis, K2 III).  I propose, therefore, to undertake the most detailed spectroscopic study of Arcturus yet attempted with the International Ultraviolet Explorer. The study includes a 24-hour superexposure of the farultraviolet (1150-2000 A) region, obtained with collaborators in the U.K., and a uniformly high signalto-noise map of the 2750-2900 A region of the middle ultraviolet. The IUE observations will be coordinated with ground-based high-resolution spectroscopy of the Ca I, Ca II and H-alpha lines of the optical region.  The SWP superexposure will be utilized to search for bands of the carbon monoxide 4th positive system, which have been identified in low dispersion spectra but are not seen in the existing 8-hour SWP echelle exposure, and to detect, or set harder upper limits on, highexcitation emission lines like C II 1336, Si IV 1394, and C IV 1548, which are diagnostics for the presence of hot plasma (T>2_10^4 K) in the outer atmosphere of the red giant. The strength of the farultraviolet ionic emission lines can be used to constrain the competing models to explain the structure of red giant chromospheres, coronae and winds, while the fluoresced molecular features can be used to probe the coolest layers of the red giant photosphere, which are radiatively pumped from above by the strong chromospheric emissions of O I 1305 triplet) and C I (1657 multiplet). The high quality map of the middle ultraviolet region can be utilized to study the strong chromospheric emission cores and faint inner damping wings of the Mg II resonance lines, and the weak emission core of the neutral magnesium resonance line at 2852 A. These spectra can he applied to a number of problems ranging from the properties of the circumstellar envelope and wind of Arcturus, to the surface gravity and mass of the archetype red giant.|Y
LGGDD|The Envelopes of RV Tauri and Semi-Reg Dwarf Variables Durind the Rise to Maximum Light|Dennis W.|Dawson|F & M College|We propose obtaining low-resolution LWR and SWP spectra and some high-resolution LWR spectra of representative bright RV Tauri and yellow semiregular variables between phases of mid-rising light and maximum (when acoustic effects of pulsation are seen to be strongest), to probe their chromospheric and possible transition region structure. This will provide important information on the role of acoustic energy transport in the atmospheres of low mass, metal-deficient supergiants. We want to examine the emission profiles of the Mg II h and k lines in detail, for velocity asymmetries, circumstellar absorption, variability of envelope conditions, and an estimate of absolute magnitude through a form of the Wilson-Bappu effect applied to these lines.|Y
LGGEB|Search for White Dwarf Companions of BA Stars Evolving up the Giant Branch|Erika|Bohm-Vitense|U Washington|We want to look for a correlation between temperatures of white dwarf companions of Ba stars and evolutionary state of the Ba stars. We expect to find generally cooler white dwarfs for cooler (i.e., further evolved) Ba stars. Only for the brightest (i.e., generally closest) Ba stars do we have a chance to see those cool white dwarf companions. Only mild Ba stars can be found bright enough. We therefore want to look for white dwarf companions in bright mild Ba stars of advancing spectral types.|Y
LGGIL|Search for Technetium in Barium Stars|Irene|Little-Marenin|Wellesley College|This proposal will provide a critical test of the hypothesis that the s-process enhancements in both classical and mild barium stars is a consequence of recent mass exchange or mixing. To test this hypothesis, we will search for the lines of ionized technetium (Tc II) at 2543, 2610, and 2647 A. Since all the isotopes of Tc are radioactive and 99 Tc, the isotope produced by the s-process, has a half life of 200,000 years, the mere detection of Tc will establish if the s-process enrichment has occurred relatively recently in these stars.  Classical barium stars are now all thought to be binary and the s-process material enrichment is presumed to have occurred during the red giant phase of evolution of-the original primary star. Our search for the lines of Tc II in HD 116713, if successful, would eliminate that possibility. On the other hand, some mild barium stars do not show any indication of a binary nature (e.g. omicron Vir) but do show enhancements of s-process isotopes by a factor of 4. Hence the detection of Tc II lines in this star would definitely establish that the enrichment episode occurred recently. The discovery of differences in the occurrence or strength of technetium would confirm that classical and mild barium stars are two distinct classes of objects whose s-process enrichments come from different sources, and that they do not just represent different ends of a continuous sequence of s-process enhancements.|Y
LGGJL|Atmospheric Modeling of Cool Giant and Supergiant Stars|Jeffrey L.|Linsky|Colorado - JILA|We propose to continue our collaborative program of obtaining and analysing high dispersion SWP spectra of cool stars. We request high dispersion, short wavelength IUE spectra of the stars alpha Tau (K5III), gamma Cru (M3III), epsilon Peg (K2Ib) and beta Cam (G0Ib) with exposure times of 16 hours or more. These spectra will provide measurements of line profiles, widths and Doppler shifts in addition to density-sensitive and opacity-sensitive line ratios. Models of chromospheric and transition region (where present) structure will be calculated by a combination of emission measure analysis, line opacity/probability of escape methods and model atmosphere calculations for optically thick resonance lines such as MgII h and k, including partial redistribution radiative transfer. These models will be used to investigate the atmospheric energy balance and the nature of energy transport and nonradiative energy deposition processes. The results will be considered in relation to stellar evolution and compared with the chromospheric properties of other stars previously studied by the authors and their collaborators.|Y
LGGRC|Empirical Model of the Atmosphere of the K Supergiant in Zeta Aurigae|Robert D.|Chapman|NASA/GSFC|The objective of this research program is to calculate an empirical model of the outer atmosphere of the K supergiant in zeta Aurigae, using IUE data gathered during the atmospheric eclipse phases of the 1979-1980 eclipse. The present activity will concentrate on the temperature and density structure (including a characterization of density inhomogenieties) of the atmosphere.|Y
LGGTS|Active Regions in Yellow Giant Stars|Theodore|Simon|Hawaii|There have been extensive studies of chromospheric activity cycles and the rotational modulation of chromospheric emission lines of solar-type dwarf stars at visible wavelengths and with IUE. These investigations provide valuable information on the size, spatial distribution (a real filling factor), longevity, and surface brightness of stellar active regions. In turn, these expressions of magnetic activity, in stars of different mass and effective temperature, place constraints on dynamo models of stellar activity. There have been many fewer studies of cyclic variations in the chromospheric spectra of cool giant stars, which would show how a lower surface gravity alters the time-dependence and characteristic spatial scalelengths of stellar dynamos.  We propose to study the changes in UV emission lines formed in the upper chromospheres and transition regions of two, rapidly-rotating, G0III yellow giants, 31 Comae and psi3 Piscium, over an interval of 12 days, which corresponds to two rotation cycles. We will search for evidence of rotational modulation of the line fluxes as chromospheric structures (plages, active regions) appear on one limb of the star, move across the visible disk, and then pass out of view over the opposite limb of the star. The detection of cyclic changes in the UV emission lines of these luminous stars will allow us to draw a comparison with the significant rotational effects previously observed in young, active dwarf stars. A further comparison will be made with the active, rapidlyrotating subgiant components of RS CVn-type binaries. To our knowledge, 31 Com and psi3 Psc are both single stars in their first crossing of the H-R diagram, which maintain their rapid rotation because neither star has yet experienced substantial magnetic braking by a coronal wind like the Sun's. The dominant topology of surface magnetic fields on these stars is therefore likely to be in the form of closed loops, which confine the hot plasma detected at UV wavelengths. From the modulation of their UV emission, it will be possible to determine whether these loops are distributed non-uniformly over the surface of the stars.|Y
LGHAD|The Incidence of Winds From Metal Deficient Giant Stars|Andrea|Dupree|Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory|We propose to detect the onset of mass loss in the H-R diagram among metal deficient field giants. High dispersion, long wavelength exposures may reveal the presence of asymmetries in the Mg II profiles produced by mass ejection.  The presence of mass loss in metal-poor stars is thought to play an important role in stellar evolution, particularly in the globular cluster giant stars, which themselves are not accessible to IUE in the high dispersion mode. Moreover, it can give clues to the metal dependence of stellar winds and acceleration mechanisms.  Metal deficient field giants are particularly attractive because they tend to have high space velocities and, as a result the Mg II line profiles are not subject to contamination by interstellar Mg II absorption.|Y
LGHBP|A Search for Hot Degenerate Companions of Late-Type Giants with Heavy-Element Excesses|Benjamin F.|Peery|Howard University|mass exchange in binary systems has recently attracted attention to the role that it may play in altering chemical abundances in the atmosphere of the accreting star. Characteristic duplicity of Ba II stars has suggested that such systems are examples of this process at work: that accretion of s-processed matter from a more highly-evolved companion may account for the anomalously high abundances of s-process elements in the Ba II star. IUE observations have indeed revealed white-dwarf companions in some of these systems, and highexcitation emission lines in others.  In this proposal I request IUE observing time to search for evidence of hot evolved companions of M-type giants with anomalously high abundances of sprocess elements, i. e., stars of types S and MS. The candidate stars differ from the more conspicuous stars of type S, which are semi-regular or longperiod variables. The candidate stars vary little, if at all, they have modest overabundances, and show little Tc, if at all. IUE observations have revealed that the 3 candidate objects observed so far do, indeed, have hot companions.  Future analysis of the cool atmospheres may shed light on details of the evolution of the companion that has shed processed mass.|Y
LGHHJ|Upper Atmospheres of Late M Stars|Hollis R.|Johnson|Indiana|Although the later M stars have colors redder than the warmest N stars and, presumably, lower effective temperatures, their ultraviolet spectra differ considerably. An M star, in low resolution IUE spectra, shows a rather smooth, featureless continuum, while the warmer N stars and coolest R stars show very strong photospheric absorption lines of zero-volt iron-peak elements. These same differences are seen between M stars and a few K stars with weak ultraviolet continuum brightness and weak Mg II emission. This suggests a pronounced difference in atmospheric structure, with the upper photospheres of cool M stars being heated non-radiatively. Thus we have the possibility that the outer atmospheric structure of all M stars is determined by such non-radiative effects. We propose to study the late M giants at high resolution, obtaining spectra for a large enough sample of objects that differences among them can be evaluated and properties of the group can be defined. These will be used (a) to determine the temperature structure of the outer atmosphere of a late M star (through the excitation and ionization of ironpeak elements), (b) to contrast the conditions in cool M and warm N star atmospheres, and (c) to study the differences in chromospheric heating in M, K, and carbon stars. Model atmospheres for cool stars have been calculated routinely at Indiana University over the last decade. These will form the basis for upper photospheric models to predict spectra of the different classes of objects.|Y
LGHJL|Variability of the Winds, Chromospheres and Transition Regions of Hybrid Stars|Jeffrey L.|Linsky|Colorado - JILA|We propose to investigate the variability of the winds, chromospheres and transition regions of hybrid stars and, hence by relating the observed variability to our earlier studies of hybrid star atmospheric structure, constrain both models of this structure and theories concerning the winds from these stars. By means of LWP-HI Mg II spectra (obtained in the 10 US2 shifts) we will derive the level and timescales of variability of the wind velocity and mass loss rate, and also of the chromospheric line fluxes. In order to relate the wind and chromospheric variability to that seen in the transition region emission lines, we will obtain, at two epochs, transition region line profiles for the star, alpha TrA, from the SWP-HI images (to be obtained in the collaborative US1/ESA shifts). The observed variability will be analysed to search for any systematic behaviour.|Y
LGHSB|Activity Cycles in the Hyades and Praesepe|Sallie L.|Baliunas|CFA|The giant stars in the Hyades present a well-studied group of stars of spectral type KO III. Their optical properties are quite similar, if not identical. All rotate with the same, slow period. Yet their chromospheric and coronal emission is different one from another, by as much as a factor of ten. We conjecture that this disparity results from sampling during different phases of long-term activity cycles which are present among dwarf stars. Some variation on a three-year timescale has been observed, as well as during phases of rotation modulation, however, at levels too small to explain the discrepancy of the emission strengths between the stars.  We propose to investigate the range of chromospheric activity from these giants which are similar in the visible three ways: (a) reobserve the Hyades to search for variability on at least a seven-year timescale; (b) reobserve another young cluster, Praesepe, with four KO III stars similar to those in the Hyades to search for variability on a five-year timescale; (c) extend the sampling to four Hyades moving group stars with similar photospheric properties. The ultraviolet spectra provided by IUE represent the longest time frame, seven years, over which to search for long-term activity variations.|Y
LGIHJ|Upper Atmospheres of Late M Stars|Hollis R.|Johnson|Indiana|The ultraviolet spectra of late-type giant stars show considerable variation from star to star, apparently related to the level of chromospheric activity. In addition to the well known decrease in Mg II emission with decreasing effective temperature, there are changes in the strength and, possibly, the optical depth of the Fe II spectrum and differences in photospheric Fe I between M giants and carbon stars. Our goal is to determine the variation in chromospheric structure with temperature for the coolest M giants and to reproduce the observed UV spectra of at least the upper photospheres through theoretical models.|Y
LGISB|Two-Dimensional Mapping of the Activity in FF Aquari|Sallie|Baliunas|Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory|Our long-term investigations of FF Aqr, an eclipsing binary system with G8 III and subdwarf component stars reveals that the chromospheric activity in FF Aqr is intense and extreme, primarily because the G8 III star rotates synchronously with its 9-day orbital period. Using the hot subdwarf star as a probe of the atmospheric structure of the G8 III star, we have found that the ultraviolet line-forming region of the GS III star extends at least 1.5 stellar radii above its photosphere. We propose to time the disappearance of the G8 III star's influence on the subdwarf spectrum and thereby measure the geometric extent of the ultraviolet structure through the G8 III star's atmosphere. We plan to diagnose the physical structure of the extended atmosphere with line strengths and ratios.  Finally, we plan to investigate the nature of the H-alpha emission enhancement as a function of orbital phase. The subdwarf apparently causes H-alpha emission to reach maximum strength near secondary eclipse, probably by the irradiation of the facing hemisphere of the cool star by the hotter component. In addition, ground-based spectroscopic and photometric observations of FF Aqr will be carried out at Oak Ridge and Villanova observatories.|Y
LGJHJ|The Upper Atmospheres of Late M Stars|Hollis R.|Johnson|Indiana|The ultraviolet spectra of late-type giant stars show considerable variation from star to star. apparently related both to the level of chromospheric activity and to the physical state of the chromospheric gas. In addition to the well known decrease in Mg II emission with decreasing effective temperature, there are changes in the strengths and possibly the optical depths of the Fe II lines, and systematic changes in electron density and temperature along the spectral sequence. In addition. there are important differences in both photospheric Fe I absorption lines and Fe II emission lines between M giants and carbon stars. Our goal is to extend our understanding of the variation in chromospheric structure with temperature to the coolest M giants and to reproduce the observed UV spectra of the upper photospheres and low chromospheres of cool M giants through theoretical models.|Y
LGJSB|FF AGR|Sallie L.|Baliunas|CFA SAO|Our long-term investigations of FF Aqr, an eclipsing binary system with G8 III and subdwarf component stars reveals that the chromospheric activity in FF Aqr is intense and extreme, primarily because the G8 III star rotates synchronously with its 9-day orbital period.

We plan to diagnose the extended atmosphere with a high-resolution Mg II profile. We propose to investigate the masses and absolute dimensions of the system and its components with radial velocities derived from ultraviolet and visible spectra and thereby study the evolutionary status of this unusual system.  In addition, ground-based spectroscopic and photometric observations of FF Aqr will be carried out at Oak Ridge and Villanova observatories.|Y
LGKJB|Intrinsic Lyman Alpha Profile of a High Radial Velocity G Giant|Jay A.|Bookbinder|Colorado - JILA|Abstract unavailable|N
LGKMJ|Search for a Close Companion to V Hya, a Rotating Carbon Star|Michael|Jura|UCLA|The H I Lyman-alpha (Ly-alpha) line is probably the most important cooling channel for plasma in the temperature range of 10^4 to 10^6 K in late-type stars, yet it is also the least studied major line in the far UV. This line also serves to fluoresce Fe II lines, while Ly-beta (whose flux can be estimated from the flux of Ly-alpha) will fluoresce lines of O I and S I in cool giants. Accurate intrinsic stellar line profiles are needed (1) as a diagnostic of stellar transition regions, (2) for studies of H I and D I absorption in the local interstellar medium (LISM), (3) to understand fluorescent excitation mechanisms in detail, and (4) to determine the total intrinsic stellar Ly-alpha flux from low-dispersion observations. However, the absorption of much of the stellar Ly-alpha flux by interstellar material and the geocoronal background upon which the stellar emission feature is superimposed seriously complicate the analysis of this line when it is observed in low-dispersion.  It is possible to circumvent, to a large extent, the influence of the LISM on the intrinsic stellar profile by observing stars with radial velocities sufficiently high to Doppler shift a large fraction of the stellar emission line out of the LISM absorption core. In our 10th year IUE program (CSJJB) we have observed 6 stars to date, covering a range of spectral types and luminosity classes, with radial velocities > |100| km/sec (corresponding to > |0.4| A at 1216 A). We used low dispersion observations to determine the total Ly-alpha flux received from these stars. One of these stars, HD 39364, has sufficient Ly-alpha flux that it is feasible to obtain a well exposed high-dispersion spectrum in a dual-shift exposure. This proposal requests time to obtain a high resolution spectrum of HD39364. This star, because of its high radial velocity and brightness, might be the best target star for which IUE can observe the core of an intrinsic stellar Ly-alpha profile.|Y
LGKTA|The Age of the Hyades|Thomas R.|Ayres|Colorado - CASA|Based on recent evidence, it is very likely that Capella (alpha Aurigae: G6 III+F9 III) is the same age as the nucleus of the nearby Hyades open cluster. Further, the evolutionary status of the fast-rotating F9 secondary star is well-established (it is one of the rare "HertzsprungGap" giants, in a transient, magnetically-active phase of the first-crossing to the red giant branch). Thus, if one can measure the mass of Capella "F", the age of the Hyades follows directly. Unfortunately, previous attempts to record the diffuse, rotationally-broadened absorption lines of the secondary spectrum in the optical and near-IR have met with mixed success, presumably owing to the confusing influence of the rich, sharp-line spectrum of the cooler, more slowly-rotating primary. One study finds the secondary about 7% less massive than the primary; and the inferred age is nearly a factor of three less than commonly assumed for the Hyades based on the cluster turnoff method. If that mass estimate is correct - and Capella and the Hyades nucleus truly are coeval - then there is a curious, inexplicable deficit of early-A main-sequence stars in the cluster. A second study - based on extensive observations with a CORAVEL-type radial velocity spectrometer - finds that the secondary is less massive than the primary by almost 20%; an amount large enough to stretch the credence of existing models of stellar evolution.  Therefore, I propose to apply a carefully-designed observing strategy to obtain the highest SIN, highest-wavelength-precision observations ever attempted with the IUE in order to: (1) establish, unambiguously, the radial velocity semiamplitude of the secondary of Capella - by observing in the 1800-2000 A region where the F9 photosphere is seen in its most favorable light; and (2) record the faint emissions of the far-UV spectra of the primary and secondary in order to study questions of gas-dynamics, line-broadening, and densitysensitive line ratios at the limits of the capabilities of the IUE.|Y
LGLHJ|Companions to CH Stars|Hollis R.|Johnson|Indiana|Stars of spectral type CX are Population II giant stars which show evidence of carbon enrichment in their atmospheres. Because they are not thought to be asymptotic giant branch stars and therefore could not have begun the third dredgeup, their non-solar abundances have presented a problem. As a subgroup of the peculiar red giants, the CH stars appear to be more closely related to Ba II stars than to K-M giants and may have undergone mass-transfer from a binary companion in the past. Recently verified periodically variable radial velocities demonstrate that the CH stars do have companions, and it is widely suspected that these companions are white dwarfs which are responsible for the carbon enrichment of the present giant through earlier mass transfer when the present white dwarf was an AGB star. We will systematically search for such companions to determine which may owe their peculiar abundances to their binarity and to determine the nature of the companion.|Y
LGLKC|Short Timescale Variations in the Outer Atmosphere of Gamma Crucis|Kenneth G.|Carpenter|NASA/GSFC|We propose the acquisition of a series of UV spectra of the M-giant Gamma Cru to search for short timescale (i.e. 1 - 10 day) variations in the chromosphere and UV spectrum of the star. Our primary probes will be the numerous Fe II lines seen throughout the 2200 - 3200 A region, along with the Mg II h and k lines and the C II (UV 0.01) intercombination lines. High resolution line profiles and accurate fluxes will provide a comprehensive probe of the state (density, temperature) and stability (velocity field) of the outer atmosphere. The C II lines will be used to monitor changes in the electron density, while the behavior of the Fe II and Mg II lines can be used to study changes in the velocity of the wind versus radius and time. The outward motion of any chromospheric event will be followed by examining Fe II lines of differing optical depths, and thus differing formation heights, in the time series. Any detected variations will provide valuable clues toward understanding the excitation mechanism(s) of individual Fe II lines, and especially aid our attempts to distinguish lines dominated by photo-excitation processes (e.g. Lyman-alpha/Fe II fluorescence) from those primarily excited by collisions. This latter work will support the goals of 2 major ADP program submitted in the current proposal cycle.|Y
LGLMS|Periodic Ultraviolet Variations in Two Red Supergiants|Myron A.|Smith|CSC|We propose to combine LWP IUE observations with radial velocities from an ongoing, long-term optical program for two normal red supergiants, al Sco and a' Her to confirm and refine estimates of -,1 yr. radial pulsation periods and amplitudes in these stars. Since these two stars also appear to be in dose binaries as well as pulsators, a particularly accurate estimate of their masses and radii can be made. We also wish to utilize Mg II emission variations to examine the propagation of shocks and their heating of superficial regions of M supergiant atmospheres. Finally, the simultaneous IUE and optical observations of these stars over short time intervals should clarify the physical origin of stochastic radial velocity fluctuations.|Y
LGLSD|An IUE Study of F Giants|Stephen A.|Drake|ST Systems|We propose to observe a number of carefully selected F giant stars in both SWP-LO and LWP-HI modes, as part of an investigation into the onset and evolution of the chromospheres and transition regions of intermediate-maw stars in which we will use the emission lines of species such as C I, C IV, and Mg II as diagnostics. Stars in this region of the H-R Diagram were A stars with radiative envelopes when in their main sequence phase and are either still in or have only recently evolved through the delta Scuti instability strip, and are in the process of developing outer convective envelopes. We discuss the difficulties of correctly identifying bona fide F giants from lowerluminosity interlopers, and explain the criteria that we have adopted to select our sample. We argue that the proposed new observations will significantly increase the total number of IUE spectra of such stars, and that analysis of the resultant data should yield valuable insights into the nature of the mechanism (acoustic as opposed to magnetic dynamo) that is responsible for the outer atmospheric heating of evolved F-type stars. In addition the measurement of the Mg II emission-line widths in these stars (that all have known trogonometric parallaxes) will enable us to determine if this characteristic is an accurate estimator of the absolute visual magnitudes of F stars (as it is in G to M stars).|Y
LGLTA|Cool-Star Betathon|Thomas R.|Ayres|Colorado - CASA|As the IUE becomes firmly entrenched in the second decade of its mission, it is time to move away from the dominant focus of the first decade: broad-brush surveys of as many objects as possible regardless of how weak the resulting spectra might be. Continuing to add an increasing number of increasingly-marginal detections to the Archives is not the way to achieve fundamental understanding of, for example, physical processes in the high-excitation (10^4- 10^6 K) outer atmospheres of magnetically-active F-M stars. While such survey work was absolutely vital in the early years of the IUE, its continuation must fall to the next generation of instruments. The HST will will be capable of recording 1-A-resolution far-UV spectra of latetype stars a thousand times fainter than the IUE limit. Since the IUE cannot compete with the HST in faint-object spectroscopy, a better future course for the IUE lies in doing what it does best: taking diagnostic-quality SWP-HI spectra (0.15 A resolution; 1150-2000 A) of bright stars.  The SWP echellograms represent a unique scientific resource that will not be duplicated by the HST spectrographs (owing to the minimal free spectral range of the HRS). The SWP-HIs have proved to be essential in exploring the properties of magnetic activity among late-type stars, particularly concerning the dynarnics and energy balance of the 10' K subcoronal transition zone. Unfortunately, the existing database of images is rather spotty, with only a few stars represented by more than one deep exposure. In the spirit of our exploratory SWP-HI work in the first decade of the IUE, we propose to invest a significant amount of observing time - both NASA and ESA - to acquire additional long-duration exposures of key stars. We will conduct the observations using newly-developed strategies designed to significantly enhance the quality of the spectra compared with previous work. The stars that will most benefit from new deep SWPIlls are betaAqr (G0 Ib), beta Cet (K0 III), beta Dra (G2 Ib-IIa), beta Gem (K0 III), and alpha Boo (K1 III). Owing to the nature of the targets, and the long durations of the proposed exposures, we call our project the "BETATHON" (with apologies to Arcturus).|Y
LGMDL|Fluorescent Clues to the Atmospheric Shock Structure of Cool, Variable Stars|Donald G.|Luttermoser|Colorado - JILA|We propose to investigate the relationship between chromospheric emission and fluorescent processes of variable, late-type giant stars using LWP observations coordinated with ground based spectroscopy and photometry. Fluorescent lines will enable us to indirectly measure both the strength and velocity of the Mg+ ions. We will monitor the Mg II h and k lines for the semiregular (SRb) variable R Lyr and the long period (LPV) variable R Leo at both low and high dispersion in order to establish the shock phase of the outer atmosphere and measure the Fe I (UV44) flux at 2823A and 2844A. Near simultaneous ground-based spectra near the Fe I (42) lines at 4202A and 4308A will also be obtained, together with photometry from the Automatic Photoelectric Telescope Service.  Fe I emission at 4202A and 4308A, present in many LPV's postmaximum spectra, has been speculated to be fluoresced by Mg II h and k (e.g., Bidelman and Herbig 1958; Willson 1976). The proposed mechanism involves a circumstellar Fe I (UV3) line at 2795.0A which absorbs Mg II (UV1) photons (2795.5A) from the chromosphere below, and then re-emits these photons in the Fe I 4202 and 4308 lines which share the same upper state with the 2795 line. One might therefore expect Fe I (42) fluoresced emission from all stars with known circumstellar shells and Mg II emission, however no fluorescence of these lines have been reported for the. semi-regular (SRb) variable, cool giants. Fe I (UV44) is seen in emission in the SRb stars al 2823.3A and 2844.0A (e.g., Carpenter et.al 1988), which is fluoresced by the Mg II k line through Fe I (UV44) at 2795.5A. We wish to monitor all of the fluoresced lines of Fe I simultaneously with tile pumping lines of Mg II. We will use the observations to answer the following questions: (1) Are the Mg II emission features caused by outward propagating shocks? (2) How do the chromospheric heating rates correspond to variability type? (3) Do the fluoresced Fe I features originate in the CS environment or upper photosphere/lower chromosphere? (4) Why are the Fe I (UV44) lines fluoresced in the semi-regulars and not the Fe I (42) lines (as is the case for the LPVs)? (5) Are there any changes in the Fe I (42) line core flux in the semi-regulars over their visual light cycle? (6) How do the "chromospheric" velocity fields differ between the Mira-type and semi-regular variables?|Y
LGMMK|Coordinated IUE and Speckle Observations of the Mira AB System|Margarita|Karovska|Harvard SAO - CFA|Mira AB system belongs to a class of detached binaries where a compact object accretes mass from the wind of a cool giant or supergiant. This system is an ideal case for detailed study of accretion processes in detached binaries: it is nearby, bright and easy to study at many wavelengths, and can be easily resolved using speckle interferometry. IUE satellite and speckle interferometry techniques present a unique opportunity to observe the accreting component of the system (Mira B) in UV and optical wavelengths uncontaminated by Mira A, and to determine unambiguously the energy distribution for both components.  We propose to obtain IUE observations of Mira AB in coordination with simultaneous ground-based speckle interferometry and photometric observations. Our primary goal is to determine accurately the energy distribution and the luminosity of the hot component and test accretion theory and theoretical models of accretion disks. We win also study Mira B variability and attempt to identify the mechanisms producing these variations.  This will be the first time that the Mira system is observed simultaneously with IUE, speckle interferometry and photometry. We also propose to obtain simultaneous IUE and ROSAT observations over a US2 shift to extend the wavelength baseline from the FUV to the EUV and X-ray regions. In support of these observations, an international campaign is being organized in which coordinated, intensive ground-based polarimetric, spectroscopic, infrared, and radio observations of the Mira system will be conducted.|Y
LGMMS|Ultraviolet Variations and Physical Parameters of Two Red Supergiants|Myron A.|Smith|CSC - Astronomy Programs|A two-year continuation is requested of a long-term program to monitor the UV continuue and Mg II h1k emission in the two M supergiants, alpha 1 Sco and alpha 1 Her. Ongoing radial velocity studies with the "solar-stellar connection" spectrograph at the McMath telescope on Kitt Peak indicate that these stars may have pulsation periods near one year as well as, in each case, a "long period" near six years, which probably reflects binary motion. We propose to combine IUE and optical data to determine these periods and to test the hypothesis of binarity. It is anticipated that these periods will provide new estimates of the mass and radii of both supergiants. In addition, Mg II h/k variations will be compared with the incidence of transients observed in the H-alpha profiles of these stars to assess whether magnetic processes may play a role in chromospheric dynamics. If, instead, they correlate with pulsation phase we will utilize the time-integrated h/k emissions to examine the influence of pulsationally driven shocks on the heating of the chromospheres.|Y
LGMPJ|The Mira/Semi-Regular Connection|Philip G.|Judge|Colorado - JILA|Substantial mass-loss for stars on the asymptotic giant branch has been inferred for Mira stars for some time. Mass-loss mechanisms involving the coupled action of stellar pulsations and dust formation have been shown to account or the observed mass-loss rates by Bowen and colleagues. Mechanisms for stars with substantial massloss, but which are not regular pulsators, are not yet identified or understood. An important goal of this proposal is to obtain the data needed to identify the mass-loss mechanism for the semi-regular stars.  The Mg II line fluxes are sensitive indicators of non-radiative processes occuring in layers of evolved giants where energy and momentum is imparted to the wind. We propose to monitor the Mg II line fluxes with the LWP camera at low dispersion, for a sample of semi-regular giant stars, This sample differs from previously studied stars because the stars have far infrared excesses similar to those of Miras. Simultaneous ground based photometry will be obtained to help identify the phase of tile variation of the Mg II lines.  We will compare our findings with our earlier similar studies of Miras and with our study of high dispersion Mg II line profiles of "non-dusty" semi-regulars obtained during the present (twelfth) round of IUE observations. Using the IRAS database and other constraints, we will study the relations between Mira-like behavior and the semi-regulars, both SRa and SRb types. From this study we will learn about the nature of the mass-loss process from cool giants, and obtain strong constraints on models of the evolution of the circumstellar envelopes, and hence of stellar evolution on the AGB.|Y
LGMTA|The Binary Hypothesis for Peculiar Red Giant Formation|Thomas B.|Ake|CSC - GHRS|Stars of type MS, S, and C are those descendents of K and M giants which show evidence of CNO processing and enrichment in s-process elements. While most of these are thought to be thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, recent abundance determinations indicate that the M-MS-S-SC-C sequence may not be a simple evolutionary one, and that the peculiar red giants (PRGs) are a heterogeneous mixture of objects with different evolutionary histories. One subgroup of these, the objects possessing no technetium, appear to be the cooler analogs to Ba II stars and thus may owe their spectral peculiarity to a prior mass-transfer event rather than actively mixing new s-process material to their surface. In this scenario, the current peculiar star was contaminated by a secondary when it was on the AGB. and that component is now a white dwarf. Recent radial-velocity studies that most S stars may be binaries has strengthened the Ba IIS star connection. In our past studies, we have found that five Tc-deficient MS and S stars have hot companions, two of which exhibit high -temperature UV emission lines indicating the components are close enough for mass transfer to have occurred, but one star thought to be the spectroscopic link between the S stars and Ba II stars surprisingly does not have a companion. We propose to observe 4 more Tc-deficient MS and S stars to complete our survey of known Tc-deficient PRGs.|Y
LGMTS|IUE Observations of Rapidly Rotating Giants|Theodore|Simon|Hawaii|Rotation measurements of more than 1900 evolved stars of spectral types F through K have been carried out with the CORAVEL spectrometer to an accuracy of 1 km s^-1. These measurements establish a well defined rotational dividing line in the H-R diagram near spectral type F9 for luminosity classes IV to Ib. Single stars with rapid rotation are found only to the left of this boundary line; stars to the right are, in almost all cases, very slow rotators. This discontinuity in rotation may signal the onset of dynamo activity and the activation of a magnetic rotational brake. A very few stars with moderately rapid rotation are found to the right of the dividing line. These unusual stars appear to avoid the fate of the vast majority of high luminosity stars, which spin down to very slow rotation rates as they evolve across the H-R diagram. How this happens is at present unknown. it is possible these stars are single and owe their rapid rotation to a sudden dredge-up of angular momentum from the interior, as envisioned in David Gray's ROTOSTAT model. Alternatively, they may be unrecognized binaries with extremely low mass companions. The purpose of this proposal is to obtain UV spectra of about a dozen such stars from the CORAVEL survey, all of them giants or bright giants, in order to (a) search for faint white dwarf or subdwarf secondaries, which might thus far have eluded detection at optical wavelengths, and (b) if no such secondaries are found, then determine from deep exposures of the UV chromospheric and transition region lines whether these stars are chromospherically active, as expected from their rapid rotation. Any evidence of binarity or any observational support of the ROTOSTAT hypothesis will be extremely important to our understanding of the evolution of stars in this region of the H-R diagram.|Y
LGNDL|Flourescent Clues to the Atmospheric Structure of Cool, Variable Stars|Donald G.|Luttermoser|Iowa State University|We propose to continue the investigation of the relationship between chromospheric emission and fluorescent processes of variable, late-type giant stars using LWP observations c-ordinated with ground based spectroscopy. We will monitor the Mg II h and k lines for the semi-regular variable R Lyr and the long period variable R Leo at both low and high dispersion. Beside measuring the flux of the Mg II lines, we are also interested in the Fe I (UV44) flux at 2823A and 2844A. Near simultaneous around-based spectra of the Fe I (42) lines at 4202A and 4308A will also be obtained with the McMath telescope on Kitt Peak, Arizona. The Fe I (UV44) lines are seen as emission lines in almost a late-type variables, while the Fe I (42) lines are only seen as fluoresced emission features in the LPV variables. Mg II h and k are speculated to be the pumping mechanism responsible for the Fe I fluorescence. Near coincident IUE and McMath telescopes observations will enable us to answer the following questions: (1) Are the Mg II emission features caused by outward propagating shocks in both LPVs and SRs? (2) How do the chromospheric heating rates correspond to variability type? (3) Do the fluoresced Fe I features originate in the CS environment, the shock/chromosphere, or a combination of both? (4) Why are the Fe I (UV44) lines fluoresced in the SRs and not the Fe I (42) lines (as is the case for the LPVs)? (5) Are there any changes in the Fe I (42) line core flux in the semi-regulars over their visual light cycle? (6) How do the "chromospheric" velocity fields differ between the Mira-type and semi-regular variables? This proposal represents a continuation of a 13th IUE year program LGMDL, but now being sent from a different institution (Iowa State University). These observations need to be continued to achieve maximum phase coverage of the late-type variables being monitored.|Y

LIOGR|UV and Optical Observations of Liners|Gail A.|Reichert|USRA|We are engaged in a systematic survey of the ultraviolet spectra of LINERs. We have obtained high quality SWP and LWP data' for five LINERs. and have used speciall techniques to separate the nuclear ultraviolet emission from the more extended stellar background. Our very long SWP spectra and separated LWP spectra have produced some intriguing results. However these results point to the diversity of the LINER class and it is not yet possible to generalize based oil these few objects. We propose new observations of NGC .5194, 5005, 4278. and 2681, to expand our sample to cover a representative range in LINER continuum and emission line properties. Our intent is to obtain high quality SWP and LWP spectra in order to 1) separate the LW (and if possible SW) emission into components, 2) establish whether the observed nuclear ultraviolet continua indicate sufficient photoionizing fluxes to explain the emission lilies, 3) determine whether the nuclear emission can be explained by hot stars alone, 4) detect and measure the strengths of ultraviolet emission lilies. and 5) search for systematic differences in the ultraviolet spectra of LINERs whose other properties differ in some respects. Near-concurrent optical observations will continue to be carried out at ground-based telescopes.|Y

LMPPH|An HR Diagram for LH 72|Paul W.|Hodge|U Washington|This proposal has as its goal the production of a temperature-luminosity diagram of a very young LMC cluster that includes a number of known OB stars, discovered at visual wavelengths. The cluster is involved in a large scale HII region, representing an area of current star formation. Ultraviolet fluxes and spectra for 10 stars will be combined with available optical photometry and spectroscopy to measure the ages, age spreads, extinction and other properties of the group. The particular significance of this group is the fact that it lies near the geometric center of a series of giant arcs that make up Shapley III and Meaburn's superbubble LMC-1. If the area was, as supposed, cleared of gas by a series of SNs, then we are interested in the question of whether the extinction law in this part of the LMC might differ from that in other areas.|Y
LNOSS|UV Observations of Novae During the Late States of Their Outbursts|Sumner G.|Starrfield|Arizona State University|We propose to continue observations of five post-explosion phase novae that are still in outburst and bright enough to study with the IUE Satellite.

We also request observing time to obtain SWP spectra of additional novae in quiescence in order to obtain UV data on 5 important problems: 1) the turnoff timescale and return to quiescence; 2) the long term evolution between outbursts; 3) the ultraviolet spectra of magnetic novae; 4) the masses of the white dwarfs; and 5) the interoutburst evolution of one recurrent nova.

Nova Cyg 1992 is the brightest ONeMg nova to be observed since Nova V1500 Cygni 1975 and we have followed it since discovery. It is relatively nearby (~2 kpc) with small reddening (E(B-V) ~ 0.2). Nova Pup 1991 has been observed by IUE since shortly after discovery and it is also an ONeMg nova with nearly identical evolutionary behavior to Nova Cyg 1992. Each of these novae has been previously observed utilizing our IUE Target of Opportunity proposal and we can accurately determine the exposure time for each camera. Nova Cyg 1992 has also been observed by HST/GHRS, ROSAT, VOYAGER, GRO, KAO, and we have an accepted EUVE proposal to study it in 1993. We will propose to observe both Nova Cyg 1992 and Nova Pup 91 with ROSAT in February 1993. We expect to obtain UV data on these novae in order to consider several important problems: 1) the spectral evolution during outburst of a slow ONeMg nova; 2) the turnoff timescale and return to quiescence; 3) the masses of the white dwarfs in ONeMg systems; and 4) the effects of non-spherical ejecta on the measured abundances.

LSHAD|The Variable Atmosphere of Alpha Orionis|Andrea K.|Dupree|CFA|We propose to continue the multifrequency monitoring of Alpha Orionis (Betelgeuse), to follow the decay of chromospheric activity as the star approaches its light minimum in 1986-86.|Y
LSIAD|Monitoring the Variable Atmosphere of Alpha Orionis|Andrea K.|Dupree|CFA|We propose to continue the multifrequency monitoring of Alpha Orionis (Betelgeuse), for the next two years. This will enable spectra to be obtained of the decay of chromospheric activity through the light minimum of the 5.8 year period and the radial velocity maximum (1987.04). Continuous observations with IUE for the next two years will provide a carefully constructed homogeneous data set covering almost one cycle of the 5.8 year photometric period.  Periastron of the recently discovered close optical companion to Alpha Ori is predicted to be 1986.7; detection of atmospheric disturbances similar to those found subsequent to the last periastron (~ 1984.6) would give strong support to the presence of a companion.|Y

LSJJB|Time Dependent Shock Structure in the Mira S. Carinae|Jay A.|Bookbinder|Colorado - CASA|The extremely high radial velocity (~ 280 km/sec) of the the Mira variable S Carinae provides a unique opportunity to study (and place empirical constraints on the physical models of) two important aspects of the physics of this class of stars: the mass loss mechanism(s), and the dynamical response of the extended atmosphere to the propagating shock.  We propose a series of LWP and SWP observations covering over 1/3 of the (150 d) period of this star immediately following the begining of a new pulsation cycle. This program has two main observational goals: (1) place empirical constraints on the dynamical models of Mira atmospheres by determining the maximum temperature and luminosity that is reached by the shocked gas, and (2) further constrain both the dynamical models and the mass loss by studying in detail the evolution of the Mg II line profile while the shock propagates outward through the extended chromosphere.|Y
LSJPS|Target of Opportunity: The Low States of Novalike Systems|Paula|Szkody|Washington|This proposal will continue a present Target of Opportunity program that observes novalike cataclysmic variables when they enter low states. During this stage, the mass transfer from the companion virtually ceases, allowing the UV flux to be dominated by the white dwarf rather than the disk or accretion column. Obtaining a low dispersion SWP and LWP exposure during the low state enables the determination of the white dwarf temperature and gravity through comparison of the Ly-alpha absorption profile width and the continuum flux distribution with white dwarf models. These temperature determinations provide a direct check on theories of heating/cooling of white dwarfs in close binaries due to accretion or cyclic nova events. Based on numbers during the last few years, there should be 5-6 low states with duration >=  1 month during a given year, enabling at least 3 temperature determinations.|Y
LSJSB|Shock Heating in V CVN|Sallie L.|Baliunas|CFA SAO|We propose to investigate non-radiative heating presumably caused by relatively slow-moving shock waves through the atmosphere of the bright, pulsating, semi-regular variable V CVn (M4-M6IIIe). Previous visible-light investigations show a persistent 192-day pulsation with a range in V-light of 7^m.0-9^m.5. A second, weaker pulsation often appears with a period between 170-190 days. H-alpha emission accompanies both pulsations but is strongest (3x nearby continuum) for the primary pulsation. The photospheric velocity amplitude is rather modest (4-5 km s^-1) for such bright H-alpha emission.  Shock models appropriate for red, low gravity stars predict significant nonradiative losses in ultraviolet lines, for example, Mg II (2800) and Si II (1820). While Mira variables are known to show strong Mg II emission, we would like to test the shock models by obtaining the ultraviolet emissions from the less luminous semi-regular variable V CVn.|Y
LSJSD|The Outer Atmosphere and Wind of Delta and|Stephen A.|Drake|ST-Systems|We propose to make deep SWP-LO and LWP-HI exposures of the recently discovered hybridchromosphere giant 6 And, so as to investigate the structure of the outer atmosphere of this K-type giant stars in greater detail than previously possible. We will use emission measure analysis, density-sensitive lines, and spherically-symmetrical, co-moving frame radiative transfer codes to model the chromosphere, 'transition-region', and wind of 6 And. By making two observations >= 6 months apart, and by comparison with the present (rather underexposed) spectra, we will be able to place constraints on the variability of delta And's emission lines, principally C IV and Mg II. We will compare the deduced atmospheric structure of delta And with those of the other known hybrid stars, which are all more luminous, and, generally of higher effective temperature, than delta And, in order to see if the different evolutionary history of delta And compared to most of the other (more massive) hybrid stars results in any systematic differences in their atmospheric or wind properties.|Y
LSJTA|Very-Deep SWP-HI of Aldebaran|Thomas R.|Ayres|Colorado - CASA|We propose to conduct the longest exposure ever attempted with the IUE (>25 hours) in order to obtain a high-quality recording of the far-ultraviolet (1150-2000 A) emission line spectrum of the bright red giant Aldebaran (alpha Tauri: K5 III), in high dispersion (0.15 A).  Our objectives include: the study of fluorescent phenomena; the measurement of tracers of temperature and density in the possibly highly-inhomogeous chromosphere; and the search for faint emissions of high-excitation species, like Si IV and C IV, which are signatures of hotter gas (101 K) usually not found in the low-gravity, evolved stars. In addition, preceding and during the very long SWP exposure, we propose to monitor the chromosphere and wind of Aldebaran, with LWP echellograms exposed for the Mg II 2800 doublet. Our objective is to document possible short-term variability like that identified in optical studies of the redgiant Arcturus.  Our proposal is intended to carry forward a program - to explore the ultraviolet spectra of stars of late spectral type - that we, and our collaborators at Oxford, have been conducting since the early years of the IUE.|Y
LSKAD|Periodic Variability in Red Supergiants|Andrea K.|Dupree|CFA SAO|Our discovery (Dupree et al 1987) of a 420-day periodic variation in the radiations from Alpha Ori (Betelgeuse) was made possible by dedicated frequent observations with the IUE satellite in conjunction with contemporaneous ground based photometric and spectroscopic observations, Periodic photospheric pulsations are the most likely explanation of these variations. The identification of pulsations in the atmosphere of Alpha Ori is important for they appear to be the fundamental pulsation mode of the star and can provide the long-sought mechanism to heat and to extend the atmosphere of the star, and help to initiate the mass flow from the supergiant.  We propose to continue the multifrequency monitoring of Alpha Orionis (Betelgeuse), for the next two years in order a) to seek evidence for the secondary period of -1 6 years which is hinted at in the current measurements, b) to establish the phase delay between photospheric and chromospheric modulation, c) to evaluate the stability of the 420-day period and d) to complement the precision radial velocity measures being carried out at Kitt Peak that recently confirmed our conclusion of pulsation in the star's atmosphere. Continuous observations with IUE for the next two years will provide a carefully constructed homogeneous data set for a well-studied star covering one cycle of the 5.8 year photometric period. Additionally, we propose to introduce Mu Cep, another bright M supergiant, into the program.|Y
LSKHB|Winds and Shells Around Low-Mass Supergiants|Howard E.|Bond|STScI|A class of A- and F-type supergiants lying at high galactic latitudes (the 89 Herculis or UU Herculis stars) has been known for some years. Recent evidence suggests that these objects are not young Population I objects, but instead are much older low-mass stars evolving off the tip of the asymptotic giant branch toward the regime of central stars of planetary nebulae. It is possible that these stars are already surrounded by unionized planetary nebulae, if they have experienced an extreme mass-ejection episode (or "superwind") when they were. at the tip of the asymptotic giant branch.  We propose to obtain high-dispersion long-wavelength IUE spectra of several 89 Hertype stars, in order to study the profiles of the Mg II doublet at 2800. The observations should allow us to detect the presence of mass outflow from the stellar atmospheres, and to search for circumstellar material. Discovery of such material would provide support for the scenario for planetary-nebula formation outlined above.  This program is a continuation of one begun during the eighth and ninth years of IUE observing. We have obtained high-dispersion long-wavelength spectra of HR 4912 and HD 161796, two F-type members of the 89 Her class, as well as a spectrum of the high-latitude A0 supergiant HR 4049. The first two objects, and possibly the third, do show evidence for circumstellar Mg II absorption. Moreover, the chromospheric Mg II emission in HR 4912 shows an unusual inverse P Cygni profile. This observation shows that our program is likely to provide important new information not only about mass loss from, but also about chromospheric conditions in, the atmospheres of these rare, low-mass supergiants.|Y
LSKKC|Far-UV Low Resolution Spectroscopy of M Supergiants|Kenneth G.|Carpenter|Colorado - CASA|We propose the acquisition of SWP low resolution spectra of two M supergiants. Our emission measure analysis which derive approximate structure models of the outer atmospheric layers will be extended to lower gravity, cooler effective temperatures with these data. In combination with archive data, these spectra will be used to determine: 1) the dependence of radiative loss rates from cool star chromospheres on Teff and luminosity, 2) whether there is a gradual shift in the relative importance, to the chromospheric cooling, of higher and lower temperature species as we go to cooler and more luminous stars, 3) whether there is a general trend of increasing flux in fluorescent species with decreasing effective temperature and increasing luminosity and 4) whether the weakness of specific fluorescent lines in Alpha Ori is a general characteristic of M supergiants or is unique to Alpha Ori. In addition, these new spectra will be very valuable in optimizing the choice of such objects to be observed at higher resolution and higher signal/noise with the Hubble Space Telescope.|Y

LSLKC|Far-UV Low Resolution Spectroscopy of High Luminosity K and M Stars|Kenneth G.|Carpenter|NASA/GSFC|We propose the acquisition of SWP low resolution spectra of K - M bright giants and supergiants to allow us to: 1) determine the underlying cause of the extreme weakness of certain fluorescent features, e.g. O I (UV 2), in the spectrum of a minority of such stars, 2) extend our emission measure analysis, and thus place improved constraints on the distribution of the emitting chromospheric plasma with temperature and density, to lower gravity, cooler effective temperatures, and 3) estimate the mean relative intensities of the Lyman-alpha and Lyman Beta lines within the stellar chromospheres. Used in conjunction with archival data, these spectra will also allow us to determine: 4) the dependence of radiative loss rates from cool star chromospheres on Teff and luminosity, 5) whether there is a gradual shift in the relative importance, to the chromospheric cooling, of higher and lower temperature species as we go to cooler and more luminous stars, and 6) whether there is a general trend of increasing flux in fluorescent species with decreasing effective temperature and increasing luminosity.

LTPJE|Long-Term Observations of 31 Cygni|Joel A.|Eaton|CEIS - Tennessee State University|Thirty-one Cygni is perhaps the most important of the zeta Aur binaries in that it has the greatest separation, cleanest eclipse, and best determined orbit. After the atmospheric eclipse of 1992-93, it will have the best existing combination of groundbased plus IUE data. In preparation for this eclipse, I have monitored the spectrum for three years over phases 0.66-0.94. I am proposing to continue monitoring the system (1) to study the isotropy and time dependence of the star's wind, (2) to find if accretion onto the B star depends appreciably on orbital phase, and (3) to refine the orbit of the B star.|Y

LUQMC|Variation of the Solar Lyman-Alpha Profile with Solar Activity|Michael|Combi|University of Michigan|The integrated line flux of the solar Lyman-alpha line is known to vary with the 11-year solar cycle as well as with the 27-day solar rotation. The nature of the variation of the shape of the line profile with solar activity is, however, the subject of some controversy. Reconstructions of direct observations indicate that the level of the self-reversed center of the line varies with a larger amplitude than does the integrated flux. However, indirect analysis from observations of the interstellar medium are consistent with the line-center varying in proportion to the integrated flux. We propose to observe the solar Lyman-alpha profile as reflected from the Moon with IUE for a last year using the small aperture in high spectral resolution mode. Observations during the year 15 obtained during US2 shifts demonstrate the feasibility of using IUE for this purpose. US1 observations will yield much less radiation noise. Two shifts would be scheduled approximately 27 days in advance so that two line profiles each could be obtained at relatively active and quite solar conditions with effective integrations of ~ 15 hours. These would supplement the two US 1 shifts awarded for the curtailed 16th episode. Such information is important for understanding the formation of the H line-profile in the atmosphere of the sun, and also for the interpretation of Lyman-alpha observations of the earth's H geocorona, planetary and cometary hydrogen, and the interstellar wind.|Y
LXPAC|LMC X-Ray Sources|Anne P.|Cowley|Arizona State University|Ultraviolet observations of three recently identified X-ray binaries in the Large Magellanic Cloud will be obtained. Because of the small number of X-ray binaries previously known in the LMC (only 7), these sources will add substantially to our understanding of the Magellanic Cloud systems. Furthermore, these objects appear to be unlike X-ray binaries known in the Galaxy and may represent a new class of X-ray sources. Each of the new systems contains a hot star (late O or early B), but with very weak absorption lines suggesting the presence of an additional featureless continuum which is probably due to an accretion disk. Optical spectra also show weak, variable hydrogen emission lines which may arise in the disk. Since the diagnostic lines for accretion-disk spectra lie in the ultraviolet (C IV, N V, He II, etc.), a study of these features and the UV continuum will provide information about the presence of such a disk and its physical properties.|Y
LZJDT|Low Redshift Broad Absorption Line Qsos|David A.|Turnshek|STScI|We propose to obtain observations of low redshift examples of Broad Absorption Line (BAL) QSOs. In doing so, three different types of questions concerning BAL QSOs will be addressed. First, we propose to study in more detail than previously possible the absorption-emission profiles of 2 low redshift objects already known with some certainty to be BAL QSOs. In particular we require 2 repeat exposures requiring 2 shifts in order to obtain improved signal-to-noise ratio data. This will allow an improved assessment of the BAL kinematics and more accurate column densities of C^+3, Si^+3, N^+4, and H to be determined which can be used to model ionization mechanisms and abundances. The latter analysis will have important implications for constraints on BAL region (BALR) size scale which are being investigated in detail via ground-based imaging studies. Second, we propose to study 2 low redshift BAL QSO candidates in the CIV, SiIV, NV, and Ly-alpha region. One of the objects can be studied adequately using many lower signal-to-noise ratio observations present in the IUE archives. Only one exposure with IUE currently exist for the other object and a longer repeat exposure taking an entire shift is required to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the data. If these 2 objects are indeed confirmed to be BAL QSOs, these data will then be sufficient to study in some detail the BAL kinematics and column densities. These data are important because they improve our knowledge of the fraction of QSOs with BALs at low redshifts. Finding such objects now is also particularly important because it paves the way for future imaging studies both from the ground and in space which can be designed to place constraints on BALR size scale. Our candidate BAL QSO objects have emission redshifts of 0.12 and 0.17. Third, we propose to obtain 2 additional IUE exposures (each requiring an entire shift) in order to study the MgII region in 2 of the above 4 objects. Previous IUE exposures of the 2 objects in this wavelength region are too short for adequately determining if MgII BALs exist. In one other of the above 4 objects, IUE archival data need to be coadded to search for MgII BALs. If MgII BALs are present in these 3 objects, it would be particularly important because it would indicate that the BALRs of QSOs have systematically lower ionization at low redshifts. In some reasonable scenarios this would have profound implications for the evolutionary history of QSOs.|Y

Although the role of other factors such as evolutionary state, effective temperature, and radius has previously been considered, the role of metallicity has not. We propose to observe 12 binary pop II systems that range in metallicity from [M/H] = -0.4 to -2.3. We will compare and contrast the emission fluxes with those of pop I dwarfs and examine whether transition region and chromospheric fluxes behave similarly.|Y

MCHJH|Star Formation in the Magellanic Clouds|John B.|Hutchings|DAO|Low dispersion spectra will be taken to find and study the hottest stars in compact regions of recent star formation in the SMC and LMC. The data will determine luminosities, temperatures, ionising flux, mass-loss and masses of the youngest massive stars. The results will be used to compare processes of star formation in the Magellanic Clouds and the Galaxy.|Y
MCJBB|Spectrophotometry of Emission-Line Stars in the SMC|Bruce|Bohannan|Colorado - CASA|Ultraviolet spectrophotometry from IUE will be combined with visible-light spectrophotometry to measure effective temperatures and gravities of a sample of emission-line stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud through comparison of observed continuum fluxes with Kurucz model atmospheres. IUE spectrophotometry is critically important because the spectra of early-type emission-line stars are often so complex that visible light absorptionline strengths can be a potentially misleading indicator of effective temperature. Indeed, some of these stars have such strong emission-lines; from their dense, extended atmospheres that they have no lines arising from the photosphere. The overall goal of research is to locate the sample of SMC emission-line stars in the HertzsprungRussell diagram to gain an understanding of the paths that massive stars take in evolving from main sequence 0type stars to Wolf-Rayet stars.|Y
MCKEB|Dynamical Masses for the Two Cepheids S Mus and V636 Sco|Erika|Bohm-Vitense|Washington|For the Cepheids S Muscae and V636 Scorpii we want to determine the pulsational radial velocities for the spectral lines seen in the LWR region of the IUE Observatory. These measurements are essential for the determination of the dynamical masses for these binaries.  On LWR IUE high resolution images of S Mus and V636 Sco the spectrum of the Cepheid can be studied for lambda > 2500 A while the one for the companion can be studied for lambda < 2500 A. This fact permits the measurement of the difference in radial velocity for the two components of the binary system. After subtraction of the pulsational velocity of the Cepheid the difference of the orbital velocities is obtained. With the orbital velocity of the Cepheid known from optical studies the velocity ratio and thereby the mass ratio of the binary components can be determined.  So far the pulsational velocities for the Cepheid measured in the optical region have been used in this procedure. Observations show, however, that pulsational velocities are different for different layers of the atmosphere. Subtraction of the pulsational velocities determined for the absorption lines in the optical region, when we should subtract the pulsational velocities for the uv region, may cause large errors in the difference of the orbital velocities and their ratios. We therefore want to determine the pulsational velocities for those high layers in which the lines in the LWR region are formed. This requires measurements for many phases of the pulsational cycle.|Y
MCLNE|Magellanic Cloud Cepheids|Nancy Remage|Evans|Canada|Cepheids in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC) are crucial to our understanding of pulsation and to extragalactic distance calibration. In this proposal, we request time to obtain IUE LWP low resolution spectra of four stars. We will observe two stars in the LMC, one with a long period and one with a moderate period. A similar pair of stars will be observed in the SMC. IUE observations will be combined with fluxes from broadband V, B, R, I, J, H, and K from recent light curves to test the fit of model atmospheres from .24 to 3.5 microns. This new data will be compared with archival spectra of galactic nonvariable supergiants and Cepheids, including observations of cluster Cepheids, and Cepheids at phases covering their entire temperature range. The moderate period LMC and SMC Cepheids can be compared with galactic stars of similar period to test the accuracy of models over a range of metal abundance. Note that the correction to exposure time for SMC Cepheids due to metallicity (estimated from Kurucz atmospheres) is a factor of two as compared to galactic Cepheids. The size of the correction underscores the need for measured energy distributions for these important stars in this wavelength range.  The observations of the longer period stars in the LMC and SMC allow us to investigate changes due to high luminosity. Long period, high luminosity stars become progressively more important as calibrators in more distant galaxies, even though they do not have counterparts in our galaxy.  For comparison, we plan use published Kurucz atmospheres, new Kurucz atmospheres with more accurate ultraviolet opacity and extending to cooler effective temperatures, and new spherically extended atmospheres developed at the University of Toronto.|Y
MCMAM|IUE Observations of Binary Star Clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud|Andrew G.|Michalitsianos|NASA/GSFC|Identification of approximately 70 binary star clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud provides compelling evidence that these objects constitute a new category of astronomical phenomenon in which star clusters can form and evolve from a common parent cloud. We propose IUE observations of a select number of binary star clusters found in the LMC. From UK Schmidt plate surveys of the LMC, these systems have an average center-to-center separation of less than ~1.3 arcmin (>=15 pc). Our goal is to determine the UV spectral properties of a select number of young clusters in binary associations, and compare their energy flux distribution, and stellar absorption to determine to what extent similarities exist in the UV. Results from these observations could provide further evidence supporting the common origin of the binary cluster, if the ages of each member of a pair are found to be roughly similar. We also plan to compare their ages from their UV properties to known young clusters, in order to investigate clues concerning their origin, and specifically how these systems differ from open clusters in the LMC. IUE is especially well suited for this investigation because the age of young clusters observed in the LMC is particularly sensitive to UV colors, which mainly reflects the contribution of the main sequence population. Together with ground-based objective pries surveys of the LMC, these IUE observations will be crucial for establishing the existence of binary star clusters as a distinct object class, through a detailed population synthesis study of their UV spectra.|Y
MCMPH|Ultraviolet Colors of Young LMC Clusters|Paul W.|Hodge|Washington|It is proposed to extend the list of available IUE spectra of Large Magellanic Cloud clusters to include more very young clusters, which are inadequately sampled at the present.

MCNAM|Dust in the Small Magellanic Cloud|Antonio M.|Magalhaes|U Wisconsin - Madison|Observations of reddened stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) indicate that the interstellar grains in that galaxy may show distinct optical properties from those in the Galaxy. Prevot et al (1984) have shown that the UV extinction law in the SMC is almost linear with inverse wavelength and the 2200A feature is generally absent.  Results of a program to determine the wavelength dependence of the interstellar optical polarization in the SMC (Magalhaes et al 1989) indicate that highly polarized objects are scarce. However, several objects have optical polarization greater than or around 1%: AV 126, AV 211, AV 221, AV 398 and AV 456. Only the latter two have already had their UV extinction law determined, while AV 211 had just recently its IUE images obtained by us. AV 126, AV 211 and AV 221 all present small values of lambda(max) and our aim is to determine the UV extinction law also for AV 126 and AV 221 and ascertain a suggested trend between small lambda(max) and the 'typical' SMC extinction curve.  As discussed in the proposal, the extinction results of these polarimetric selected objects are likely to have an important bearing on constraining the composition and size distribution of the interstellar dust in the SMC.|Y

MCRBW|The Gaeous Halo of the LMC|Bart P.|Wakker|U Illinois|We request IUE time to observe five targets in order to determine the presence or absence of a continuous hot gaseous halo around the LMC. In our recent reanalysis of all IUE targets in the LMC, we conclude that previous reports of C IV and Si IV absorption attributed to a hot halo are more likely due to hot gas in superbubbles and supergiant shells. Moreover, we found tentative non-detections of C IV and Si IV absorption in three stars not associated with regions containing hot gas. We propose to improve the S/N ratio for these latter three targets, and add two new targets in whose spectra a continuous halo would show up if it exists. In order to get conclusive nondetections, the S/N ratio should be as high as possible. This implies that we will need two shifts for each of the five targets.|Y

MFEGB|Mass Function in LMC Associations|Gregory D.|Bothun|CFA|We propose to observe some of the brightest stars in Associations No. 77 and 96 in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), in order to determine the mass function for massive stars. The determination of this mass function is very important in understanding the chemical evolution of the LMC, as well as the star formation characteristics in LMC associations. These particular associations have enough massive stars to do statistics, in contrast to most young associations in the Galaxy. Studying two associations should provide some information regarding place-to-place variations in the mass function. These differences, together with possible differences of the interstellar extinction law in these associations, may give important clues to the mechanisms of star formation in the LMC.  Ultraviolet studies are necessary in order to reliably determine bolometric corrections. In addition, only UV observations yield reliable estimates of effective temperature and interstellar absorption. All of these are necessary for the proper determination of bolometric magnitude and stellar mass.|Y
MFGEB|The Mass Function in Large MAgellanic Cloud Associations|Edward W.|Brugel|Colorado-LASP|In order to determine the mass function for the most massive sitars in Associations No. 77 and 96 of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), we propose to obtain observations of the hottest (and brightest) stars in these stellar groups. Our previous IUE observations of these associations have allowed us to determine stellar spectral types with better accuracy than can be achieved using optical techniques. Therefore, it was possible to ascertain accurate positions in the H-R diagram. Although we had chosen our program stars to lie at the upper end of the optical color-magnitude diagram, the uv-spectra have shown that they are not on the main-sequence but are evolved objects. Preliminary analysis also reveals that these observations fit the evolutionary tracks for massive stars (e.g. > 10 solar masses). These data have indicated an important anti-correlation between surface temperature and visual magnitude. Thus, it is necessary to observe objects with bluer B-V colors and fainter optical magnitudes in order to detect the hottest stars in these associations. This is also important in ascertaining the correct age for the associations.  These same data can be used to investigate the apparent differences in the mass loss rates for stars in these two associations. Many of these stars are in the proper evolutionary stage for mass loss to be important but we have failed to find evidence for this process in the stars in association No. 77. However, stars in association No. 96 do show evidence for mass loss.  To better understand the behavior of the stars in these two associations we are asking for continued observations for the following reasons: 1) Observations of fainter stars (fainter in V) with bluer colors (e.g. V ~ 15, B-V ~ -0.3) are required in order to establish whether the anticorrelation between V and T(eff) continues to fainter magnitudes (e.g. are there really 03 stars lurking at V ~ 15.5). The detection (discovery) of these objects is absolutely essential in determining the mass function.  2) Obtaining spectra of more stars in association No. 96 are needed in order to ascertain if mass-loss rates are higher and line-strengths (abundances) are greater when compared with Association NO. 77.  3)These same observations are needed to establish where the main|Y

MGCTS|MGII Observations of the Young Cluster NGC 2264|Theodore|Simon|Colorado|In late-type main-sequence stars in the general field and old clusters, the intensity of the Ca II H and K emission reversal is correlated with age of the star. Strong emission and active chromospheres are common among young stars, but only weak H-K emission is visible among old stars. The emission is also greatly enhanced in T Tauri variables, which are believed to be pre-mainsequence stars.  The strengths of the ultraviolet lines of Mg II provide a very sensitive index of chromospheric heating, especially in stars hotter than the Sun. In this proposal we outline an observing program to obtain Mg II spectra of many premain-sequence stars in the young, nearby cluster NGC 2264 in order to search for enhanced chromospheric activity among stars which have not yet arrived on the zero-age main sequence. Since the age of NGC 2264 is reliably estimated to be 1-2x10^6 years, this study will establish an age "benchmark" for the youthchromospheric activity relation. Observations at low dispersion will be obtained for many pre-main-sequence cluster members of spectral types A-K. The brightest UV sources will also be observed at high resolution in order to study chromospheric velocity fields.|Y
MGDDM|Obs. of Discr Chromo Em Line Prof Asymm & Var Asymm in UV Spectra of Late-Type Stars|Dermott J.|Mullan|Delaware|Based on our observing programs dealing with the Mg II chromospheric emission features among cool post-main-sequence stars, we are in a position to continue the search for asymmetry and profile variations among the three kinds of asymmetry variables identified to date: (i) the radical asymmetry variables which exhibit discrepant asymmetries in Mg II K (V/R < 1) relative to Ca II K (V/R > 1); (11) the circumstellar variables which exhibit changes in their circumstellar thickness and velocities along the line of sight; and (iii) the "non-variables" which may in fact be variables over time scales greater than the one year so far spent in any such investigation. Stars in group (i) also show discrepant Wilson-Bappu line-widths. The radical asymmetry variables occur among objects slightly cooler and more luminous than a Magnetic Topology Transition Locus (M.T.T.L.) lying close to, but distinct from, a previously defined transition locus (formerly known as the Supersonic Transition Locus). The MTTL separates solar-type objects which possess static high temperature coronal material and circulation-type asymmetries, from the non-solartype objects which possess lower temperature outer atmospheres, substantial mass loss, and outflow asymmetries. The MTTL segregates stars according to whether the magnetic field topology dominating their outer atmospheres is open or closed. The radical asymmetry variables, lying close to the MTTL, afford our best opportunity to see the interplay between the archetypal magnetic configurations and to understand the physics involved.|Y
MGFLH|A Study of the Relationship Between MG II Emission and Rotation|Lee W.|Hartmann|CFA|It is well known that a correlation exists between chromospheric emission and rotation. However, the details of the relationship have not been explored for late-type dwarfs because of the paucity of spectroscopic rotational velocities. Recent work at Mt. Wilson has determined rotational periods for a large number of cool dwarfs from the modulation of Ca II emission. This research shows close correlation between the Ca II H and K fluxes and rotational period. However, there are some uncertainties in the flux calibration of the data. The Ca II measurements relate the HK fluxes to "continuum" bandpasses. Calibration ss difficult, because it requires a knowledge of the way the photospheric flux in the heavily blanketed "continuum" bandpasses varies with spectral type. Furthermore, an uncertain correction for the contamination of the chromospheric measurement by photospheric emission must be made.  We propose to observe the Mg if fluxes of the main-sequence stars with known rotational periods with IUE. The relative calibration should be easier to perform in the UV, since we do riot form a ratio to the local continuum. The photospheric correction at Mg II is less than at Ca II, so the UV data for F-G stars can be interpreted more accurately. Finally, Mg II emission is of comparable importance to Ca II fluxes in establishing chromospheric energy balance. These advantages of the UV observations will greatly assist the separation of the effects of rotation and spectral type on chromospheric emission.|Y
MGGJW|MG+ Observations of Earth|J. H.|Waite|NASA/GSFC|The distribution of metal ions such as Mg+ Fe+, Na+, Ca+, and Si+ in the terrestrial ionosphere has been studied experimentally through ground-based and satellite observations since 1958. These ions occur in thin layers at altitudes near 90 km and are believed to be deposited in the atmosphere by meteor sputtering and ablation. The results of observations and recent theoretical work show that the distribution of Mg+ is controlled by dynamical processes such as ion neutral collisions, and E x B drift motions. A study of the spatial and temporal variations in the Mg+ distribution can yield information on these dynamical processes. Measured intensities of the 2800A line of "g+ in the daytime ranged from 100 to 500 P. It is proposed that these natural emissions be observed by the IUE satellite during two observational periods of eight hours each. Two periods are needed to allow for some experimentation with spacecraft tracking rates and observing patterns. In addition, it is hoped that these observations will lay the ground work for observations of an artificial Mg+ cloud to be released during the CBBES program in 1986. The IUE spacecraft offers the unique capabilities to observe UV emissions which is the only strong emission signature to be used for remote sensing of magnesium.|Y
MGIEB|MG II Emission from Mira Variables|Edward W.|Brugel|Colorado - CASA|During the first year of this two year program, we propose to obtain 46 LWP observations of the brightest normal M-type Mira variables around their pulsation cycles. By observing Mg II throughout the cycle, we intend to determine the shock luminosity and duration, and the density in the upper atmospheres of Miras. These data also provide a mechanism for probing the radiative cooling in post-shock regions of the atmosphere as a function of time. This analysis is expected to yield useful information on the density structure of these highly extended atmospheres and ultimately on the mass loss process. Theoretical modeling calculations indicate that pulsation is the underlying cause of the enhanced mass loss, with radiation pressure on grains an important auxilliary mechanism for stars with P > 300^d. Models of the atmospheric structure of the pulsating Miras show that the mass loss rate during this key evolutionary phase depends strongly on the pulsation amplitude, i.e. the net input of the kinetic energy into the atmosphere. However the shock amplitude DeltaV is not very sensitive to this parameter. Instead what happens is that as the amplitude is increased, the shocks form deeper in the atmosphere, and the density throughout the atmosphere increases, so that the power radiated by the shock (alpha  p  r^2) increases. The best measure of the driving amplitude is thus the amount of radiation from the material behind the shock. The most obvious emission from this cooling postshock material is in the Hydrogen Balmer and the ultraviolet Mg II lines. The Mg II h and k lines are better indicators of the shock behavior and the atmospheric structure than the Balmer lines for two reasons. First, the Balmer lines are badly mutilated by overlying absorption most of the time when they are present. Second, the Balmer lines require a shock amplitude > 20 km/s while the shock in Miras are expected to persist after their amplitudes are too small to excite the Balmer lines. Thus visible Balmer emission cannot be used to follow the shock into the upper atmosphere, into the region from which the wind originates; Mg II emission lines can. A second year of observations are seriously required in order to determine any cycle-to-cycle variations, which would affect the interpretation; and to fill in any missing phases.|Y
MGIKC|The Winds of High Luminosity K and M Stars|Kenneth G.|Carpenter|Colorado - CASA|The winds of high luminosity K and M stars likely play a major role in stellar evolution, yet this region of the H-R diagram is one of the least-studied with IUE, due to the very limited number of targets that are bright in the ultraviolet. However, high-resolution spectra of the long wavelength region of the few well-observed stars reveal extremely interesting spectra containing dozens of broad, frequently self-reversed and asymmetric Fe II emission lines in addition to the Mg II, Al II, and C II lines seen in all late-type stars. We propose a comprehensive study of a sample of 13 such stars using both archive and new observations. We shall study the occurrence and characteristics of the Fe II line asymmetries to determine the radial dependence of the wind velocity for each star. We shall also investigate the dependence of the Fe II profiles on spectral type and luminosity class and thus the variation of the velocity fields with stellar type. This will allow us to judge the generality of the results reported for alpha Ori by Carpenter (1984b). In addition, we shall use new atomic data along with observations of the C II(UV 0.01) multiplet to estimate Ne in the stellar winds. Measures of relative Fe II fluxes will be used in a probability-of-escape model to determine the opacity and hydrogen column density versus height in the chromosphere of each star. Finally, analysis of the fluorescent Fe II lines (pumped by Ly-alpha) near 2507 will yield estimates of the intrinsic stellar Ly-alpha flux that cannot be measured directly because of interstellar and circumstellar absorption. One important goal of this proposal is to acquire high resolution spectra of the whole 2300-3200 A region of 13 luminous K and M stars as a data base that will be enormously valuable in planning observations with the Space Telescope High Resolution Spectrograph, which will be able to observe only small portions of the spectrum at one time with high sensitivity.|Y
MGJAB|Simultaneous Ultraviolet and Radio Variability Study of 4 DRA|Alexander|Brown|Colorado - JILA|We propose to obtain simultaneous ultraviolet and radio observations of the 4 Draconis system using IUE and the VLA. The 4 Dra system consists of an M3 giant primary and a companion which is itself thought to be a cataclysmic binary. It is presently the only such system known. Previous ultraviolet observations show that this companion system contains an accretion disk. Both the ultraviolet and radio emission are variable and we wish to determine if the UV and radio emitting regions are related by studying the variability of both regions. The radio observation will be binned to match the IUE exposures and the variability of the two data sets compared using cross correlation techniques. Radio variability on shorter timescales would also be studied. While the ultraviolet high temperature lines and continuum originate in an accretion disk, the radio emission could be either from this disk and its environs or from shocks in the red giant wind due to the presence of the companion system. Simultaneous observations will allow more accurate location of the radio emitting region and therefore permit a better analysis of the physical processes occurring in the 4 Draconis system. Two US2 shifts separated by one to two weeks are required to decipher the longer term changes in mean emission level both in the ultraviolet and radio spectral regions.|Y

MGJJE|Chromospheric Variability in M Giants|Joel A.|Eaton|Indiana University|Although many M giants have been observed with IUE, and although a fair fraction of these are semi-regular variables, few - if any - M giants have been observed in a way that allows their chromospheric variability to be investigated. We have previously found the chromospheric emission of the SRb variable theta Aps to be highly variable in two LWP exposures obtained - 1 year apart. This makes us wonder whether most M giants are variable in this way and whether variability can affect the properties of chromospheres derived from IUE spectra of M giants. We propose to observe (1) two SRb variables over a full "period" to see if pulsationally driven shock waves may play a significant role in heating the chromosphere and (2) a warmer, apparently constant M giant to see what the level of chromospheric variability is for the cooler equivalents of alpha Boo and alpha Tau.|Y
MGJKC|Variations in the Chromosphere and Stellar Wind of Gamma Crucis|Kenneth G.|Carpenter|Colorado - CASA|We propose to follow up the recent discovery of significant variations in the Fe II chromospheric emission line profiles from the M-giant Gamma Cru for the purpose of determining the underlying cause of the variations. The star will be observed at five different times during the year with SWP low resolution and LWPHI and LWPLO resolution to determine whether the apparent increase in the opacity of the stellar wind and chromosphere is: 1) due to additional mass being added to the outer atmosphere through a one-time ejection of mass or an increase in the mass loss rate, or 2) due to a temporary or permanent increase in the chromospheric heating rate, or 3) is a periodic effect due, for example, to rotation and the resulting variable visibility of inhomogeneities in the chromosphere. This star is the first single, non-Mira M-giant for which there is clear evidence from UV lines of substantial chromospheric variation. It is important that we monitor the development of this event and attempt to understand its origin, while the capabilities of IUE are still available to us.|Y

They show evidence for mass loss rates that significantly affect their evolutionary status, as well as providing significant mass input to the ISM.  Our 10th year program (LSJJB) to study the evolution of the shock structure of the Mira S Carinae (S Car) has produced - despite very limited phase coverage - a series of five exceptionally interesting high-dispersion spectra of the Mg II h and k lines. Deep LWP-LO and SWP-LO spectra have also been obtained. In addition, archival studies of other Miras (again with extremely limited phase coverage) indicate that S Car is not unique in possessing unusual and highly variable Mg II h arid k line profiles; a detailed study of S Car can therefore be used as a guide to the behavior of Miras in general. We intend to extend these preliminary observations in several respects.  Our prime goal is to obtain, for the first time, adequate phase coverage of a Mira to properly model its dynamic atmosphere. We request high-dispersion spectra of the Mg II h and k lines of two Miras throughout the brighter half of their pulsation cycle. The extremely important phases just prior to the shock maximum, as well as the shock peak, have not been observed in high dispersion for these stars, nor, as far as we are aware, for any other Mira. Because of the dense phase coverage (delta phi <= 0.05) required to properly model the propagation of the shocks through the atmosphere. we have restricted our observations to only two objects.  On the basis of studies of the SiO maser emission from Miras, which indicates a potentially close association of the emission with a shock, we will obtain supplementary microwave observations of the SiO maser line intensities and profiles. In order to model as completely as possible the response of an extended atmosphere to multiple shocks, we will also obtain simultaneous optical spectroscopic observations of the Ca II H and K lines, as well as the Na D and He 10830 lines. These multiwavelength observations will provide the most complete observations to date of a shocked stellar atmosphere.  By observing the Mg II lines in high-dispersion throughout a shock cycle - in addition to the observations in the optical and microwave - we will be able to place empirical constraints on the physical models of at least four important aspects of the physics of pulsationally unstable stars: (1) the dynamical response of an extended atmosphere to propagating shocks, (2) the nature of the radiative cooling in the post-shock region, (3) the mass loss mechanism(s), and (4) a test of the hypothesis that the outward propagating shock is responsible for the SiO maser emission, perhaps mediated by a "molecular catastrophe".|Y
MGKLW|High Dispersion Observations of MgII in Miras|Lee Anne|Willson|Iowa|Based on previously obtained low dispersion spectra we have demonstrated that the MgII emission from Mira variables is highly time dependent, consistent with its coming from the radiatively cooling material behind a shock wave produced by pulsation. Numerical hydrodynamical models indicate that these shock waves are an essential part of the process driving massive winds from Miras and the closely related OH-IR stars. Comparison with dynamical models indicates that MgII emission carries information on the shock cooling while the shock traverses the region from about 1.5-4 stellar radii. It is particularly important to understand the processes in the shocks in this region, as that is where the models indicate that the conditions are set for the driving of the wind. In order to disentangle the effects of overlying absorption and to determine the MgII emission as a function of position behind the shock, crucial for comparison with the models, high resolution MgII line profiles are needed. We propose to obtain high dispersion observations with reasonable phase coverage for each of two representative Mira variables, R Hor (P = 402 days) and R Car (P = 308 days). Since there are significant cycle to cycle variations of the MgII emission from Miras, we are requesting concurrent US2 time to continue monitoring these stars at low dispersion throughout the cycle for which the high dispersion observations will be obtained.|Y

R.|Doherty|Wisconsin|Objective: To make high-resolution spectral observations of the 2795, 2802 A Mg II resonance lines in F and G main-sequence stars. The purpose of these measurements is principally to compare total Mg II emission fluxes with Ca II emission in stars which are not greatly different from the sun in overall structure, are known to cover a wide range of chromospheric activity.|Y
MGMJB|Rapid Variability of the MG II Line Profiles of the Mira S Carina|Jay A.|Bookbinder|Harvard SAO - CFA|Our previous IUE programs to study the evolution of the shock structure of Miras have produced interesting high-dispersion spectra of the Mg II h and k emission lines. These lines possess unusual observational properties that appear to be common among Miras. First, the emission centroids are shifted relative to the stellar radial velocity far in excess of the presumed wind or shock velocity, an effect that we have interpreted as multiple scatterings across the shock front, in a manner analogous to Fermi acceleration of particles across a shock front. Second, these lines are also in the unusual ratio of h1k ~ 2:1; this ratio appears to vary as a function of pulsation phase, and may be the result of radiative transfer effects in the time-dependent shocked stellar atmosphere. In all previous observations, variability has been confirmed on timescales as short as one week, and there are strong indications that it may be present on timescales of one to two days.  We propose to obtain a series of very closely-spaced high dispersion Mg II observations that will constrain the short-timescale behavior of these lines; we will be sensitive to timescales from several hours to one week. For this detailed IUE study of the short timescale behavior of Miras we have selected a well-studied object, S Carinae. This study will provide constraints on the radiative transfer effects and shock evolution of pulsationally unstable stellar atmospheres, which will then be used as a guide to the behavior of Miras in general. These observations will also provide additional observational inputs to the newly emerging class of theoretical radiative transfer problems of resonance line transfer (including partial redistribution) across shock fronts.|Y
MGNGS|The Coevality of the HR 1614 Moving Group|Graeme H.|Smith|UC Santa Cruz|This proposal seeks to investigate the coevality of stars which are proposed to belong to the HR 1614 moving group, by using low dispersion IUE spectroscopy of the 2800 A Mg II lines. Recent IUE surveys of field dwarfs by Fanelli et al. and Smith et al. have demonstrated that even a low resolution Mg II spectral index is sensitive to the level of chromospheric activity. Because such activity is correlated with age among main sequence stars, IUE spectroscopy holds potential for investigating the age distribution within a sample of stars, such as a proposed moving group. The physical existence of moving groups holds implications for our understanding of the dynamical evolution of the Galactic disk and the process of star formation within the disk.|Y

MIPDL|Fluorescent Clues to the Atmospheric Shock Structure of Mira Variable Stars|Donald G.|Luttermoser|Iowa State University|We propose to continue investigating the relationship between Mg II h & k emission and fluorescent lines in Mira-type variable stars. We will obtain LWP low and high dispersion observations for the Mira variables R Leo and R Hya. IUE fluxes and profiles for Mg II h & k at 2803A & 2795A will be obtained along with near simultaneous ground-based spectra of the Fe I (42) lines at 4202A & 4308A from McMath telescope on Kitt Peak. Mg II h & k are suspected to be pumping the Fe I fluorescent emission lines. Our previous IUE programs have shown that the small variability seen in the Mg II lines in a semi-regular variable R Lyr has no effect on the Fe I (42) lines in this star. Therefore, it appears that we no longer need to monitor semi-regular variables in this program. The past coincident monitoring of the Mira variable R Leo has, however, led to some remarkable discoveries. During the pulsation cycle of R Leo in 1992, the ultraviolet emission-line fluxes were very peculiar and warrant further monitoring. We also request to carry out simultaneous monitoring of R Hya, another Mira with similar characteristics to R Leo, for comparison in order to ascertain whether R Leo is beginning an evolutionary change.|Y

MLBAB|Mass Loss In Red Giants|Andrew|Bernat|KPNO|The use of IUE to obtain accurate mass loss rates for red giants is proposed. Observations will be made of absorption lines formed in the outflowing gas from red giants undergoing mass loss. Only binary systems with early-type companions will be used. The use of such systems provides both a sufficiently bright source of background radiation against which to see the circumstellar absorption and information about the physical location of the matter. By using IUE, strong lines from numerous dominant ionization stages of abundant species will be observable. The mass loss rates determined through this study will be free of the major deficiencies of previous studies. One proposed target is a carbon star, for which mass loss rates are unknown.|Y
MLBFS|Mass Loss From Red Giants Using the IUE|Fred|Sanner|Texas|We propose to use the International Ultraviolet Explorer Satellite to study mass loss from late-type giants and supergiants. Observations of the ionizing flux distributions of these stars between 1100-3300 A at low resolution, and of the multiple ionization states of many atomic species not observable from the ground at high resolution, will allow an unambiguous determination of the state of ionization of the circumstellar gas, and of the depletions (abundances) of gas-phase elements which are believed to be locked up in circumstellar grains. This separation of ionization from depletion effects has not been possible from existing optical and infrared observations and will significantly improve our knowledge of the physical conditions in the circumstellar envelopes and of the mass loss rates of these stars. The analysis in relation to the circumstellar depletion problem will be made in collaboration with Dr. G. M. Stokes.|Y
MLBJC|A Study of the Anomalous Ionization Structure of the Winds of B Supergiants| |Cassinelli|Wisconsin|The anomalously strong O VI and N V lines in O stars and  the Si IV lines in B supergiants may be due to Auger ionization by x-rays from a thin coronal zone at the base of the cool stellar winds. If such a model is correct the N V resonance doublet at 1240 A should appear in the spectra of supergiants only as late as about B2 I, and C IV 1550 A should persist to supergiants as late as B5-B8. We propose to test the coronal ionization model by observing several supergiants with spectral types near B2 and with spectral types B5 and later. The overall ionization structure of the stellar winds will be studied by an analysis of the displaced resonance lines, using methods that we have developed recently and semi-empirical models of the stellar winds will be developed.|Y
MLBSL|IUE Observing Time and Support of Research on Mass Loss From F-Type Supergiants|S. A.|Lamb|Missouri|We request 100 hours of IUE telescope time to observe F-type supergiants in order to measure the rate of mass loss from their ultraviolet spectra. Results of a recent optical survey of such stars indicate that approximately fifty percent of them show evidence for mass flow in their Halpha line profiles. If emission lines or asymmetric absorption-lines are detected in the ultraviolet spectra, the rates of mass loss from these stars can be obtained.|Y
MLCAD|Hybrid Atmospheres and Mass Loss in Luminous Cool Stars|Andrea K.|Dupree|CFA|Two classes of late-type binary systems, the W UMa type and the RS CVn type, will be observed at various phases appropriate to orbital motion and/or to V light variations. From these measurements we can establish atmospheric structure and investigate the presence of mass motions - mass transfer or mass loss - as a function of phase.  The W UMa stars will be observed to obtain spectra Of systems spanning the period-color relation in addition to orbital coverage of 3 systems (a W-type, and A-type, and a Lucy B type) chosen to verify theoretical models.  The RS CVn systems will be sampled to provide more complete coverage of systems of varying period and to search for systematic changes that may be associated with rotational effects. Moreover, observations will be taken at appropriate phases of the V light wave to detect differences between active hemispheres and quiet hemispheres where mass loss is believed to occur.|Y
MLCDM|Variable Mass Loss Among Stars at or Near the Supersonic Transition Locus|Dermott J.|Mullan|Delaware|We propose to utilize the IUE to continue LWR observations of G, K and M stars as was done during our proposal during the second year of IUE operation. The Mg II emission cores were observed in a sample of 47 cool giants, and we found that in a statistical sense, the longward emission peak becomes dominant above a certain locus in the HR diagram. This locus lies close to a "temperature dividing line" reported by Linsky and Haisch. Combining the Mg results with earlier Ca II K data and with circumstellar shell data, a fundamental change in the structure of the upper atmosphere of cool giants, consistent with the predictions of a supersonic transition locus-hypothesis advanced by Mullan, has been determined. Two major questions remain which can only be answered by further IUE observations: (1) how sharp is this STL division in the HR diagram?; and (2) do the stars nearest the STL exhibit variable asymmetry due to instabilities in their upper atmospheres which alter the coupling between corona and chromosphere? The first of these questions can be addressed with observations of new target stars which will Improve the statistics. The second can be addressed with repeat observations of selected objects close to the STL to search for variations on a 1 year timescale.|Y
MLCHJ|IUE Studies of Stars that Eject Visible Nebulae|Hollis R.|Johnson|Lockheed|IUE spectra give critical data of mass ejection for stars that produce visible nebulae, the phenomena to be interpreted with the theory of Weaver et al. (1977). The selection of stars in symmetric nebulae yields several parameters of mass loss that are provided by the nebulae. These parameters include linear extent of wind bubble in the ambient medium, its expansion speed, and the mass of the ejected and swept up matter. Variability of AG Car permits study of a variable mass ejector. Ultraviolet phenomena of the hot component in the unique variable R Aqr will be crucial for understanding the complex phenomena of the only long-period variable with a hot component and with an ejected symmetric nebula. The proposal includes high-dispersion extensions of selected objects of first-year low-dispersion work, and new objects in the category of the proposal title.|Y
MLCJH|Stellar Winds in Hot Stars in the Magellanic Clouds|John B.|Hutchings|Herzberg|High dispersion SWP data are required for detailed investigation of stellar winds (velocities and line strengths) in SMC and LMC supergiants. 10 candidates are proposed. Low dispersion data of up to 25 fainter stars are required, to derive UV continuum fluxes and to extend the existing low dispersion data base to lower luminosities.|Y
MLCJL|A Critical Test of the Coronae/Winds Division Among Late-Type Stars|Jeffrey L.|Linsky|Colorado|One of the significant new results from IUE is the discovery by Linsky and Haisch (1979) of an apparent sharp division in the H-R diagram between stars with and without emission lines formed at 2 x 10^4 to 2 x 10^5 K. We propose to extend our previous IUE study to a larger group of carefully selected stars in order to pose a critical test of this result. Such a test is possible with a set of SWP low resolution spectra of stars which have observed He 1 10830 line strengths that imply characteristics opposite to those expected for the stars based on their position in the H-R diagram with respect to the Linsky-Haisch division. The outcome will demonstrate that either the L-H division is not sharp, or that the coronal recombination origin for He I 10830 in stars is gravely in error.  The variation in surface fluxes in transition region lines near the dividing line is important in determining whether the absence or large decrease in line emission strength to the right of the dividing line is a result of physical changes in the mean atmosphere, or a rapid decrease in the fractional volume in which transition region temperatures occur. These data are also important in providing constraints on possible wind solutions and testing whether the cool wind scenarios discussed by Haisch, Linsky and Basri (1980) are valid.|Y
MLCNM|Mass Loss in A- and F- Type Supergiants|Nancy D.|Morrison|Toledo|IUE will be used to study mass loss in A- and F- type supergiants. In the A-type, Ia - class stars, spectral features to be studied include the resonance lines of Mg II, Fe II, C II, and Si II,all of which are very broad and are Doppler shifted to shorter wavelengths. The theoretical analysis of the data will be done in collaboration with P.B. Kunasz by means of a spectrum synthesis technique, in which line profiles are calculated for models of a spherical, expanding envelope. Coordinated ground-based observations of Ila and other lines will also be compared with calculated line profiles.  The time base provided by an additional year of observations with IUE will be used to search for time variations in the line profiles and, hence, in the mass-loss rate. I also hope to observe enough stars to allow a search for correlations of mass-loss rate and line shape with stellar luminosity and effective temperature.|Y
MLCSL|Mass Loss from F-Type Supergiants|S. A.|Lamb|Missouri|We request 80 hours of IUE telescope time to further observe F-type supergiants in order to measure the rate of mass loss from their ultraviolet spectra.

If emission lines or asymmetric absorption lines are detected in the ultraviolet spectra, the rates of mass loss from these stars can be obtained.|Y
MLCTG|Stellar Winds, Supernovae and Supershells|Theodore R.|Gull|NASA/GSFC|We desire to study: (1) the ionization of unusual shell structures surrounding specific OB associations; (2) the ionization structure of shells surrounding several isolated O and Wolf-Rayet stars, and, (3) the ionization structure of the Rosette Nebula. Selection of targets is greatly aided by the Emission Line Survey of the Galactic Plane. This survey is comprised of visual photographic data acquired in passbands isolating [OIII], [H-alpha+ NII], and [SII]. The synthesis of IUE results with these existing data is expected to provide important information on the ionization structure around OB astociations. The photographic data define the spatial extent of the ionization around the observed stars. When these data are combined with derived column densities and velocity displacements from interstellar features in high dispersion spectra strong constraints can be placed on densities in each region and momentum in expanding shells. From modeling, we hope to estimate the fractional contributions of momentum imparted to the expanding shell from stellar winds and from supernovae arising within each OB complex.|Y
MLDGM|Investigative Survey of Mass Flow in Selected Short Period Binaries|George E.|McCluskey|Lehigh University|We propose to use IUE to perform an investigative survey of short period binaries selected on the basis of existing ground-based data as likely to show mass flow effects in their ultraviolet spectra. Eight binaries will each be observed once with the SWP and LWR cameras during two 8-hour shifts. If, as expected, two or three of these binaries can be profitably observed in-depth with IUE, a further proposal will be made next year. This survey will be useful in providing information concerning which types of short period binaries are in active stages of mass flow events and in providing a basis for further research.|Y
MLDGP|A Study of Mass Loss at Polar Latitudes in Be Stars|G. J.|Peters|USC|Inspired by the recent discovery of narrow (delta lambda=l A), high velocity (V = -700 km s^-1), saturated components of C IV 1550 and Si IV 1400 in the spectra of the "pole-on" Be stars omega Ori and 66 Oph, a request is made for additional IUE observing time to further investigate the phenomenon. According to the classical model for Be stars (Struve 1931), as a consequence of rapid rotation, all mass loss from Be stars should occur from the equatorial regions. But IUE data has shown that, at least in two instances, substantial material is being ejected in the direction of thepoles. Further IUE observations of omega Ori and 66 Oph are required to assess the stability of the absorbing regions. Since all pole-on Be stars do not show the high velocity lines in their spectra, we need observations of other Be stars with low values of vsin i to determine what type of star is losing mass at its poles. A total of 4 shifts scheduled in pairs, spaced six months apart, is requested to determine the nature of absorbing region, compute rates of mass loss for stars which display the high velocity lines, and establish the extent to which the presence of the lines correlates with spectral activity in the visible spectral region.|Y
MLDLH|On the Temperature Structure of Stellar Winds in Cool Stars|Lee W.|Hartmann|CFA|It had been suggested that the onset of substantial mass loss in luminous late-type stars occurs suddenly, accompanied by a rapid change in wind temperatures from 10^6 K to less than 10^4 K. The discovery of "hybrid atmosphere" stars with IUE (Hartmann, Dupree, and Raymond 1980a), exhibiting both expanding cold circumstellar shells and emission from lines formed at T > 10 K, suggests that the transition from solar-type winds to coal supergiant winds occurs in a more continuous progression. The exact nature of the variation of temperature structure and mass loss near the region in the HR diagram where circumstellar shells disappear is significant for theories of mass loss and coronal heating.  We propose to study the nature of the transition of stellar winds from lowtemperature to high-temperature outflows in four ways. 1) Very long high dispersion SWP exposures of two hybrid stars will display the variation of gas temperature as a function of velocity in their winds, a relationship which can be compared to wind models. 2) A study of 5-6 stars with large circumstellar shell velocities in the low dispersion SWP mode will indicate the ubiquity of hybrid stars and the range of velocities over which high-temperature emission occurs. 3) A study of 5-6 stars in high dispersion mode to observe C III 1909 line widths of luminous stars without circumstellar lines to see if wind expansion is detectable. 4) Concurrent circumstellar shell observations in Mg if are necessary for interpreting short wavelength results for stars with variable winds.|Y
MLDPC|Mass Loss From Early-Type Stars|Peter S.|Conti|Colorado|0-type stars and their descendants, Wolf-Rayet stars, all lose mass at a rate which appears to increase over the star's lifetime and is significant on an evolutionary time scale. IUE observations of P Cygni profiles in these stars have helped to develop the dependence of the mass loss rate on the stellar parameters (Conti and Garmany 1980), but discrepancies exist between radio and UV rates. Recently, Massa and Conti (1980) have found that the UV energy distribution of O stars is significantly flatter than B stars in the same cluster, NGC2244. It might be that high mass loss affects the stellar continuum through line blanketing, so that available model atmospheres do not consistently describe both the visible and UV spectra of O stars. We wish to observe additional cluster stars to confirm this hypothesis.  Although it is often assumed in the literature that the mass loss rate in binaries is higher than in single stars, the evidence for this is indirect. There is no firm evidence that the rate is higher before Roche lobe overflow than in corresponding single stars. We propose to observe a number of systems not yet near their Roche lobes, a few "transition" Of-type systems, and some widely separated WR binaries to see if the mass loss rate is higher than in single stars of similar types. The methods of analyses which have been developed for the single stars can be adopted for these binary systems with a judicious choice of targets and phases of observation.|Y
MLDPH|B Star Mass Loss During Stellar Evolution|Paul W.|Hodge|Washington|We propose to observe 4 of the brightest main sequence and supergiant stars in each of the two rich clusters NGC 330 and NGC 2100 in the Magellanic Clouds. We want to take high resolution, short wavelengths spectra. These very young clusters have several supergiants which must have essentially the same age and mass as the brightest main sequence stars. They therefore offer the possibility to follow the evolution of mass loss during supergiant stages for essentially identical stars except perhaps for differences in rotational velocities.  This will give us information about the final mass of massive stars during later stages of stellar evolution which determines the central temperature in their final stages of element synthesis. This appears very important to understand the early history of the chemical evolution of our galaxy. The MCs, with their somewhat lower metals abundance and higher relative gas densities, can be thought of as simulating earlier stages of evolution in our own galaxy.|Y
MLECW|Short Time Variations in the Mass-Loss Rate of Early Type Stars|Chi-Chao|Wu|CSC|High dispersion IUE spectra obtained in the 1978 - 1980 period for the B0.5 IVe star gamma Cas revealed the presence of strong and sharp resonance absorption lines of N V, C IV, and Si IV. These lines are seen superposed on the broad, blue shifted photospheric and stellar wind absorption components. The sharp lines have velocities around -100 or -1400 km s^-1 and are believed to be caused by "UV Shell" episodes. We propose to carry out frequent monitoring of gamma Cas (and less frequently several secondary targets) and to obtain high time resolution observations as soon as the UV Shell lines are detected. The data are needed to: (1) determine the correctness of the models which attempt to explain the lack of detection of intermediate velocity (-100 > V > -1400 km s^-1) UV Shell lines, (2) to derive the velocity law for the stellar wind, (3) to construct the ionization structure of the gaseous envelope, (4) to study the brief UV Shell phase of the Be stars, and (5) to derive the mass loss rates for both the high density UV Shells and the steady stellar wind. These investigations may give important clues to the mass loss phenomenon of early type stars.|Y
MLEPB|Superionized Species & Winds in Normal B Stars|Paul K.|Barker|W. Ontario|The UV spectra of emission line B type dwarfs show asymmetric resonance line profiles of superionized species indicative of mass loss via a stellar wind. The correlation of the superionized species with projected rotational velocity suggests that the wind may arise preferentially from the stellar equatorial regions. For some normal B dwarfs, optical spectral features show asymmetries which also imply equatorial mass loss for the most rapid rotators. We propose a systematic UV survey of normal B dwarfs, over a wide range of spectral type and projected rotational velocity, to determine whether rapid rotation, rather than the Be phenomenon, is the primary requisite for the occurrence of a superionized wind in low luminosity B stars. The results of this investigation, compared to results of equivalent Be star UV surveys, will thus influence theoretical studies, both of the production of superionized species in winds, and of the nature of the emission line stars.|Y
MLEPH|Mass Loss Evolution in NGC 6530|Paul W.|Hodge|Washington|We propose to compare the characteristics of the mass-loss process in hot supergiant stars in each of three galaxies of different composition, the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds. NGC 6530 is similar in age to NGC 330 in the SMC and NGC 2100 in the LMC. These very young clusters all have several supergiants that have essentially the same age and mass as their brightest main sequence stars and thus can allow us to follow the evolution of mass loss during supergiant stages for essentially identical stars for three distinctly different chemical abundances. The Magellanic Cloud observations have already been begun (with a run in September, 1981), and are the subject of a separate proposal. This proposal is for the Galactic cluster, NGC 6530.|Y
MLERH|Far-Ultraviolet Study of Active Shell Stars|Ryuko|Hirata|University of Kyoto|By comparing the time development of far-ultraviolet and visual shell spectra of active shell stars, we investigate the structure and development of Be-envelope.

MLFCD|Sharp Line Displaced Features in O Subdwarfs: A Second Mass Loss Mechanism|Charles A.|Dean|S. M. Systems|Evidence now suggests a second manifestation of mass loss in luminous O and B stars (Lamers, Gathier, and Snow 1982). Narrow absorption features shortward-shifted 900-2000 km s^-1 are commonly seen superimposed upon UV P Cygni profiles in these stars. These features, although they may vary in intensity, often persist over periods of years. These components can contribute between 10 to 60 percent of the stellar wind column density. Since they are observed at large expansion velocity they also are a major contributor to the total mass loss observed in these stars. Recently shortward-shifted narrow features indicative of mass loss have been seen in hot white dwarfs.  Recent observations suggest that the P Cygni phenomenon is represented in O subdwarfs but appears squelched in O subdwarfs of lower luminosity. Our preliminary investigation of archival data also shows shortward-shifted narrow absorption features are present in two O subdwarfs. Sharp features in the white dwarfs and O subdwarfs are also reminescent of those seen in luminous O and B stars. However, they appear without the accompanying P Cygni profiles. We propose a more extensive study of shortward-shifted narrow absorption features in O subdwarfs in order to determine 1) the universality of shortward-shifted narrow absorption features in O subdwarfs; 2) the long term stability or variability of these features; 3) how the physical parameters of these features compare with those in luminous O and B stars, and 4) explore what appears to be a low luminosity cut-off for P Cygni characteristics in these stars. Our present ignorance of the morphology of mass loss in O subdwarfs represents an important gap or "missing link" in our current understanding of mass loss in hot stars. Thus, this study is crucial to obtaining such a better understanding of this process.|Y
MLFCG|Narrow Components in Hot Star Winds|Catharine D.|Garmany|Colorado|It has been known for some time that the non-saturated P Cygni profiles in hot stars often show sharp absorption components superposed on the broad absorption feature, but there is little understanding of their nature. Similar components of a highly variable nature are seen in many Be stars, and Henrichs, et at. (1982) have argued that it is due to episodic mass loss and is a common phenomenon in all early-type stars. However, it is not clear that we are seeing the same thing in the Be stars and the O stars. Lamers, Gathier and Snow (1982) found these narrow components in 17 of 25 O and B type stars observed with Copernicus. The velocities of the narrow absorption is approximately three-quarters of the terminal velocity in all the stars, implying that they are not variable in velocity. From a larger sample of IUE -data, Garmany (1982) has found that the strength of the narrow components is independent of the star's position in the HR diagram, which implies time variability. We propose to make use of archive data on a large number of O-type stars as well as additional observations to answer the following questions: do the narrow components occur in all O-type stars and are they variable in appearance and time? Are they really uncorrelated with the star's position in the H-R diagram? Can these narrow components be formed in the same manner as those in Be stars? In answering these questions, we hope to discover their mechanism of formation and how they are related to stellar winds in general.|Y

MLFJL|Mass Loss Rates for K-M Giants and Supergiants|Jeffrey L.|Linsky|Colorado - JILA|This proposal is an essential component of a larger program aimed at deriving for the first time accurate mass loss rates from K-M giants and supergiants. The program consists of the development of a PRD radiative transfer code to model spherically symmetric expanding atmospheres and to compute emergent line profiles, the application of this code to determining mass loss rates and atmospheric properties of a selected sample of K-M giants and supergiants, and a VLA observing program to obtain mass loss rates for these stars independently from their free-free microwave emission. This proposal is to obtain new IUE high dispersion spectra of the Mg II h and k and Mg I 2852 A resonance lines and spectra of these lines from the IUE archives, and then to use our radiative transfer code to derive the mass loss rates and atmospheric properties. An important selection criterion for the target stars is that the circumstellar and interstellar absorption features be widely separated so as not to be confused. This selection criterion is essential for the unambiguous analysis of the data, but it does limit the stars that can be studied.|Y
MLFPC|Stellar Winds in the Magellanic Clouds|Peter S.|Conti|Colorado|There is increasing evidence that the wind velocity of early-type stars in the Magellanic Clouds is lower than in Galactic stars. Hutchings (1980) has found this in a sample of very luminous supergiants in the Clouds, and Bruhweiler, Parsons and Wray (1982) have found the same thing for B-stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Radiation pressure in the lines of abundant ions is generally believed to be the mechanism driving the winds, so a reduced abundance of heavy elements should result in a lower wind terminal velocity. One of the observational tests of this theory is to compare stellar winds from stars with a wide range in metallicity. Both of the Clouds, and the SMC in particular, appear to be underabundant in metals (Bruhweiler et al., 1982, and references therein).  The O-type stars, which have the highest wind terminal velocities in Galactic stars, have not been examined because their counterparts in the Clouds have not been identified. Recently, as part of a study of the initial mass function in the Clouds, we have obtained slit spectra with the CTIO 4-meter of over 130 Cloud stars, including about 30 early and middle O-type stars. We propose to observe these with IUE at low dispersion and compare their wind velocities with similar well studied stars in our Galaxy. We will be able to compare stars of known temperature and bolometric magnitude to explore the relation between terminal and escape velocity discussed by Abbott (1982). This has not been previously possible because of the uncertainty in spectral types based on photometry. We have found this to be particularly true in the SMC, where a sample of stars considered to be early O by Humphreys (1982) have all turned out to be anomalous B emission stars.|Y
MLFPH|Evolution of Mass Loss in Stars of Magellanic Cloud Clusters|Paul W.|Hodge|Washington|We propose to continue our study of the brightest main sequence and supergiant stars in two very young, rich clusters, NGC 330 and NGC 2100, in the Magellanic Clouds., These globular-like clusters have several supergiants that must have essentially the same age and mass as the brightest main sequence stars. They allow us, therefore, to follow the evolution of mass loss during supergiant evolution for nearly identical stars, giving information about the final mass of massive stars in the MCs during the later stages of stellar evolution. This, of course, determines the central temperature in their final stages of element synthesis. The MCs, with their somewhat lower metals abundance, can provide us with information about how this process occurs for stars that are-chemically quite different from those in the solar neighborhood. Having obtained good spectral coverage of the LMC cluster, NGC 2100, we will concentrate this year on the more difficult cluster, NGC 330, in the SMC.|Y
MLFPM|Stellar Winds in M31 and M33|Philip L.|Massey|DAO|We wish to observe the brightest OB stars in M31 and M33, selected from ground-based photometry and objective prism surveys, for spectral type, lack of extinction, and spatial distribution. The purpose is to observe the UV fluxes and stellar wind lines to make a global comparison with galactic and Magellanic Cloud star winds. We hope also to discover whether there is a galactocentric variation in the stellar winds. The brightest OB star IC 1613 will also be observed for the same purposes.|Y
MLGBS|A Study of Main Sequence B Stars with Strong Winds|Blair D.|Savage|Wisconsin|We request 2 US1 and 2 US2 shifts to study main sequence B stars with abnormally strong winds. So far, only one group of stars has been found whose low dispersion spectra indicate such winds. These are in the open cluster NGC 6231. Analysis of a high dispersion spectrum of one of these stars shows that it does indeed have a strung wind and suggests that an overabundance of carbon is responsible. The main sequence B stars in NGC 6231 also have the smallest galactocentric radius of any observed. It may be that their strong winds are indicative of a galactic carbon abundance gradient. We propose to verify our results for NGC 6231 by observing additional members at high dispersion and to survey, at low dispersion, main sequence B stars in other open clusters with galactocentric radii similar to that for NGC 6231.|Y
MLGCW|Short Time Variations in the Mass-Loss Rate of Early Type Stars|Chi-Chao|Wu|CSC|Previous high resolution UV observations of a number of OB and Be stars revealed the sudden appearance and disappearance of narrow, high velocity absorption components in the P-Cygni resonance lines. Detailed analysis of existing data indicates that these features evolve significantly in a matter of hours and previous observations, while providing important insights for some aspects of the mass loss phenomenon, do not have sufficient time resolution to document the behavior of the narrow components or other absorbing material at intermediate velocities in the wind. We propose to carry out frequent monitoring of a primary star and one or two secondary stars which are shown to be currently active, and to obtain high time resolution observations as soon as the UV shell lines or enhanced low velocity absorption are detected. These data are needed to (1) determine the correctness of models which attempt to explain the lack of detection of intermediate velocity UV shell lines, (2) to derive the velocity law for the stellar wind, (3) to construct the ionization structure of the gaseous envelope, (4) to study the brief UV shell phase of Be stars, and (6) to further pin down the time scales for the formation, development, and disappearance of this phenomenon. These investigations will give important clues to the mass loss phenomenon of early type stars.|Y
MLGFB|Variable Mass Loss in Hot Subluminous Stars|Frederick C.|Bruhweiler|Catholic University|Sharp shortward-shifted features in two (2) hot white dwarfs and three (3) O subdwarfs indicate mass loss. One O subdwarf, HD 128220 B, shows multiple components (4 in one exposure) appearing both persistent, lasting over a nine month period, and also transient in nature. We have tentatively suggested that -the mechanism responsible for these features is the same one responsible for similar features superimposed upon P Cygni profiles in luminous relatively unevolved O and B stars. The occurrence of these discrete features has not been adequately explained. However, transient features imply mass ejection events. We wish to obtain additional images of the white dwarfs displaying shifted features and monitor the sharp-lined components in HD 128220 B for changes in intensity and velocity. Results of this study will be compared with those of similar studies of the luminous O and B stars. We wish to determine the nature of the mechanism responsible for these features and ascertain if it is a universal process operating in all hot stars regardless of luminousity.|Y
MLGJC|The Dependence of Wind Properties on Luminosity Class for B Stars in NGC 3293|Joseph P.|Cassinelli|Wisconsin|Three US1 shifts are requested to obtain high dispersion spectra of early B stars in the open cluster NGC 3293 in order to study their wind properties. Because NGC 3293 has a main sequence turn off near BO, it contains BO.5-1, class I-V stars. Since its members should have the same age, initial chemical composition and distance, they form a particularly useful sample for studying the dependence of wind properties on intrinsic stellar parameters. The homogeneity of this sample will remove many of the ambiguities which complicate similar studies based on field stars and may reduce the broad scatter in existing mass loss rate versus luminosity relationships significantly.|Y
MLGJL|Detailed Study of the Alpha Orionis Wind by the Analysis of FE II Profiles|Jeffrey L.|Linsky|Colorado - JILA|We propose to use archival high-resolution LWR spectra, which contain high-quality profiles of the Fe II emission lines in the 2300 - 3200 A range, to determine the velocity fields, radial structure, and geometrical extent of, and the mass loss resulting from, the cool wind surrounding c.<Ori (M2 Iab) and the variations of these parameters with time. The determination of the velocity fields in a series of spectra taken over nearly a five year period will indicate whether the behavior of the wind is closely tied to the photospheric radial velocity phase or, if instead, the wind variations are stochastic in nature and-thus more closely related to the large-scale convective cells hypothesized by Schwarzschild (1975). An investigation of the correlations between emission line strengths, velocities, asymmetries, excitation levels, and transition strengths, combined with theoretical modeling of selected Fe II profiles will allow us to characterize the radial structure of the wind and to more precisely estimate the velocities, temperatures, and densities present in the wind and the resultant mass loss rate. The large number of unblended, unmutilated Fe II lines in these spectra, and the wide range of excitation levels and intrinsic line strengths they represent, provide us this unique opportunity to determine the properties of the wind around alpha Ori from low in the chromosphere up into the circumstellar shell. These same spectra also contain the densitysensitive C II intercombination multiplet near 2325 A, which will allow us to determine the geometrical extent of the wind and its variation with time. This combination of data on the speed, direction, extent, and timedependence of the wind is essential for testing the predictions of stellar wind theories.|Y
MLGPM|Stellar Winds in the Hot Stars of Nearby Galaxies|Philip L.|Massey|Aura|We are proposing to complete a study begun last year to extend our knowledge of stellar winds to the hot stars in M31, M33, and IC1613. We now know that this data can be successfully obtained for about a dozen stars with IUE. These observations will also allow us to derive UV extinction laws for these galaxies.|Y
MLGTA|Wind or Antiwinds|Thomas R.|Ayres|Colorado-Lasp|One of the surprising discoveries by IUE is that of redshifted emission lines of Si IV and C IV in the farultraviolet spectra of several late-type giants and supergiants. In the solar atmosphere, redshifts of high excitation emissions frequently are observed over magnetic active regions, and are thought to be associated with downflows of 10^5 K plasma in magnetic filaments. Nevertheless, the giants and supergiants that exhibit redshifted Si IV and C IV emissions differ substantially from dwarf stars like the Sun in terms of their fundamental stellar properties. It is possible, therefore, that the redshifts of the giants and supergiants have an entirely different origin than suggested by the solar analogy. For example, the appearance of a redshifted emission profile could result from an expanding, optically thick wind owing to the "P-Cygni" mechanism.  We propose to continue, in the 7th year of IUE, the exploration of redshifts of high excitation emissions by addressing the question of whether the phenomenon in the supergiants is produced by an outflow of optically thick plasma (a "wind") or by a downflow of material (an "antiwind"). The test requires observations, using a precise radial velocity technique, of the intersystem lines of Si III (1892) and C III (1909) in the spectrum of the most luminous star, beta Draconis (G2 Ib-II), for which redshifts have been detected previously. In particular, the intersystem lines are optically thin, and therefore cannot exhibit a P-Cygni effect, whereas the Si IV and C IV doublets might be optically thick and therefore susceptible to the P-Cygni phenomenon. Furthermore, owing to different sensitivities to density, the C III] emission will be more heavily weighted towards a low-density, extended wind, while the Si III] emission will tend to be formed in the higher density structures from which the permitted lines of Si IV and C IV arise. Accordingly, the absolute velocity of Si III] 1892, and the difference in the velocities of 1892 and C III] 1909, can be used to test the wind and antiwind hypotheses. The highest precision in the measurement of the velocity differences can be achieved by taking a minimum of four separate spectra of the 1900A region of Beta Dra. The optimum exposures of the 1900 A region of Beta Ori are 7 hours, but the precise measurement of radial velocities requires that the satellite be thermally stable prior to the observations. The necessary stability can be attained, and maintained, only by coordinating US2, Vilspa, and US1 shifts on consecutive days. An important practical byproduct of the requirement for thermal stability is the opportunity to take Intensity Transfer Function calibrations in the LWR or LWP cameras during the long SWP exposures.|Y
MLHCW|Short Term Variations in the Mass Loss Rate and Linear Polarization of Be Stars|Chi-Chao|Wu|CSC|Previous high resolution UV observations of a number of Be stars revealed the sudden appearance and disappearance of narrow, high and low velocity absorption components in the P Cygni resonance lines of C IV, Si IV, Si III, and N V. Analysis of our data obtained during the 1984 September observing run indicates these features evolve significantly in a matter of 2-7 hours, implying that continuous monitoring of the program stars is required to follow the development of the narrow absorption features. Optical spectropolarimetric observations of OB stars have shown that short term variation in the linear polarization in OB supergiants is consistent with mass ejection from localized portions of the stellar atmosphere. We propose to carry out frequent coordinated IUE and optical polarimetric observations of a primary star and one or two secondary stars which are shown to be currently active, and to obtain high time resolution observations both of the UV resonance line profiles and optical linear polarization in the wavelength range 4000-7000 A. These data are needed to (1) determine whether the episodes of enhanced linear polarization are associated with episodes of enhanced mass loss observed in the UV, and (2) to pin down the geometry and timescales for formation, development, and disappearance of episodes of enhanced mass loss from OB stars near the main sequence. These investigations will give important clues to the mass loss phenomenon of early type stars.|Y
MLHDM|A Search for Co-Rotating Interaction Regions in Stellar Winds|Dermott J.|Mullan|Delaware|We propose to study the displaced narrow absorption components ("sharp lines") which have been discovered in the UV spectra of certain masslosing stars. We wish to determine if the properties of the narrow components are consistent with a recent proposal of "co-rotating interaction regions" (CIR's) in the winds. The CIR scenario makes predictions about the narrow components, and some of these seem to be useful in interpreting certain characteristics of a small number of stars chosen at random in the H-R diagram. However, there exists at the present time no planned series of observations of any star aimed at evaluating all of the predictions of the CIR scenario. The purpose of the present proposal is to observed the narrow components in one or two stars in each of several different spectral types (from 0 to M) and luminosity classes (from supergiant to white dwarf) in order to determine how widespread is the applicability of the CIR scenario in the H-R diagram. We would like to determine (among other properties) the time-scales on which a sharp line forms and decays: such information would be extremely valuable in guiding theoretical modelling of the nonlinear aspects of stream-stream interactions in stellar winds. For this purpose we would like to plan a series of observations at specific times so as to sample as broad a range of time-scales as possible.|Y
MLHFB|Variable Mass Loss in Hot Subluminous Stars|Frederick C.|Bruhweiler|Catholic University|Sharp shortward-shifted features in at least two (2) hot white dwarfs and three (3) O subdwarfs indicate mass loss. One O subdwarf, HD 128220 B, has shown Multiple components (4 in one exposure) appearing both persistent, lasting over a nine month period, and also transient in nature. This year, we were able to follow a mass loss episode in HD 128220 B lasting at least 11 days. Strong discrete components of N V, C IV, and Si IV were seen to appear and disappear as well as show velocity changes. These observations represent the first successful attempt to follow a mass loss outburst in the subluminous O subdwarfs, Dramatic changes in the components are seen on a timescale of two hours. The behavior of these components is not understood, but may be similar to those seen Superimposed upon P Cygni profiles in luminous relatively unevolved O and B stars. We wish to continue monitoring HD 128220 B for variable mass loss. We al So wish to review recent high dispersion archival data for examples of similar phenomena in other O subdwarfs. Results of this study will be compared with those of similar studies of the luminous O and B stars. Our ultimate goal is to determine the nature of the mechanism responsible for these features and ascertain if it is a universal process operating in all hot stars regardless of luminousity.|Y
MLHPC|Mass Loss and Narrow Absorption Component VAriability in Xiper and Delta Ori|Peter S.|Conti|Colorado|The goal of this investigation is a detailed study of the timescales, and nature, of variability in narrow absorption components and the underlying P Cygni profiles of two early type stars Xi Per (07.5 III or I) and Delta Ori (09.5 III).  Shortward displaced relatively narrow absorption components are a common phenomenon in UV P Cygni profiles of many 0 Stars and B super giants, as well as some Be stars (Lamers et al. 1982; see for a review Henrichs 1984). Despite being virtually ubiquitous, and often a dominant characteristic of unsaturated P Cygni profiles, the origin of the narrow components is not known. Detailed analysis of these variable features is therefore clearly important to the understanding of the nature of stellar winds in early type stars. We propose to carry out intensive short timescale IUE observations of Xi Per and 6 Ori. An ongoing detailed survey of narrow components in early-type stars based on IUE databank and literature searches, suggests that these two stars present an exceptional opportunity to study rapid (hourly) changes in the strength and velocities of narrow absorption features in O stars. Furthermore these stars also exhibit extensive (though not necessarily correlated) changes in the underlying stellar wind P Cygni profiles.  The new data are needed (1) to establish the timescale for formation of the high velocity narrow lines in the form of broad low velocity absorption. Recently obtained data might suggest a possible periodicity in formation time of these broad features in the order of a day (2) to derive a timescale for acceleration of the absorption from low to high velocity, which is of the order of half a day (3) to find out which of the presently existing different models is able to describe the observed behavior, and (4) to give more insight in this fundamental aspect of stellar wind structure of early-type stars.|Y
MLHSS|The SN Stars|Steven N.|Shore|CSC|The aim of this project is to study a class of stars in which the phenomenon of magnetically controlled stellar mass outflow has been discovered using IUE. Three extreme helium weak stars included in the seventh year program, HD21699, alpha Scl, and 36 Lyn, have been found to show rotationally modulated C IV 1550 absorption profiles. All three stars are now also known to have phase variable strong photospheric magnetic fields. In HD 21699, the absorption appears to arise from a jet emerging from above one of the magnetic poles. All three stars have the common, serendipitously discovered, property of being classified as sn stars according to Abt (1979). The class is still of a broad enough nature that all of the (optically) well-studied members should be observed. The fundamental result should be the elucidation of the parameters which describe where in the peculiar B star sequence magnetic fields play a role in both initiating and structuring stellar winds, and what relation such large scale mass motions have to the mechanism responsible for the creation of anomalous abundances of elements in the stellar photosphere.|Y
MLHTS|Stellar Winds in B and Be Star|Theodore P.|Snow|Colorado LASP|it is proposed to use IUE data to obtain high-resolution, farultraviolet spectra of a number of B and Be stars of spectral types BO through B8 to determine the dependence of winds on stellar parameters in the region of the H-R diagram where winds are only marginally present, and to explore the relationship between B and Be stars, particularly with regard to wind properties. By determining which stars have winds and which do not in this borderline region of the H-R diagram, it may be possible to learn which stellar characteristics cause or influence the wind, which in turn may have important implications for their origin in these and more luminous hot stars. By comparing winds in B and Be stars, it may be possible to isolate the factors that make some stars Be and others not. The proposal requests observations of relatively bright objects, all of which can be observed during NASA shift 2.|Y
MLIAD|Mass Loss from Metal Deficient Giant Stars|Andrea K.|Dupree|CFA|We propose to detect the onset of mass loss in the H-R diagram among metal deficient field giants. High dispersion, long wavelength exposures can reveal the presence of asymmetries in the Mg II profiles produced by mass ejection.  The presence of mass loss in metal-poor stars is thought to play an important role in stellar evolution, particularly in the globular cluster giant stars, which themselves are not accessible to IUE in the high dispersion mode. Moreover, it can give clues to the metal dependence of stellar winds and acceleration mechanisms.  Metal deficient field giants are particularly attractive because they tend to have high space velocities and, as a result the Mg II line profiles are not subject to contamination by interstellar Mg II absorption.|Y
MLICG|Mass Loss Rates from Archive O-Star Images|Catharine D.|Garmany|Colorado - JILA|We propose to analyze P Cygni profiles of archive O-star exposures to determine mass loss rates using Lucy's (1982) periodic shock model as a description of the wind's velocity field. This is in contrast to all previous UV mass loss rates which have been derived with the assumption of a time-independent, monotonic velocity law. This approach should resolve questions about stars with moderate mass loss rates which bears both on the theory of stellar winds and the observational effect on the stellar environs. Stars with the largest mass loss rates can be observed in the radio and visual, but more moderate stellar winds can only be detected quantitatively in the UV. Although there is quite good agreement between theory and observations for rates in excess of 10-6 M(sun)/yr, some important questions remain concerning stars with lower mass loss rates. These include evidence for strong shocks (Lucy and White 1980) and the presence of discrete components (Henrichs 1984). The run of density between shocks has been worked out by Abbott (1985) and can be incorporated into existing programs. We anticipate that the column density of the shock model implies a reduction of a factor of two in all previous UV mass loss determinations. This has important implications for theory and evolution of massive stars.|Y
MLICW|Wind and Polarization Variability in Be Stars|Chi-Chao|Wu|CSC|IUE observations of several Be stars have revealed that the appearance and disappearance of shortward-shifted narrow absorption components (SNC) in the P Cygni resonance Lines of N V, C IV, Si IV, Si III, and AL III are associated with recurrent episodes of enhanced mass flux which take months to develop, but have been observed to disappear on shorter time scales. Superimposed on this Long-term variability are day to day changes in the wind profiles and in several cases hourly variations. These short-term changes are of interest in testing models for SNC production because the time scales are comparable to non-radial pulsation periods and to the time required for a mass ejection event to propagate through the acceleration zone and subsequently decay. We propose a program of hourly and day to day monitoring of early Be stars suspected of regular wind variation. The IUE observations will be made in conjunction with a program of regular optical spectropolarimetric observations. These data are needed (1) to determine whether day to day and hourly variation in mass flux is a general property of Be stellar winds, (2) to determine whether the short time scale changes in wind characteristics are associated with changes in the optical Linear polarization. These investigations will give important clues to the mass Loss phenomenon in early-type stars and will complement monthly monitoring programs for the same stars.|Y
MLIDM|Rapid Wind Variability in the B Super-Giants HD 164402 and HD 167756|Derck|Massa|A. R. Corp.|It is demonstrated that all stars within a specific region of the HR diagram have narrow absorption features in their wind profiles at any given time. Most of these stars have features, simultaneously, in their Si IV, C IV and N V wind lines. Available spectra show that the features vary significantly, in both strength and central position, on time scales less than 16 hrs, in accord with simple kinematical arguments. These attributes make these stars especially well suited for addressing three fundamental questions concerning the origin of the narrow features. (1) Does the material responsible for the features propagate with the ambient wind flow? (2) Does the ionization structure of the features change with distance from the star? (3) What is the time scale for the recurrance of the features? To answer these questions, a long uninterrupted time series of observations is essential.|Y
MLIFB|The Unuasal Mass Loss/Accretion Phenomena of the O Subdwarf HD 128220 B|Frederick C.|Bruhweiler|Catholic University|Our investigations reveal the bright O subdwarf, HD 128220 B, to be one of the most unusual examples of mass loss/accretion activity of any object so far studied with the IUE. Sharp, shifted variable absorption in C IV and Si IV, in up to five distinct components. displaced at both negative and positive velocities has been seen at one time. The binary, HD 128220 AB, is very peculiar in that visual results show that H-alpha sometimes is in emission and indicate the mass of HD 128220 B is quite large and likely to be a precursor to a supernova. Yet, the behavior of the observed shifted features is remarkably similar to those seen in normal O and B stars. We propose a combined IUE and ground-based study of this system to: a) establish the origin of the H-alpha and determine if it suggests that the UV features arise due to interactions between the stellar components, b) probe the short and long timescale variability of the shifted absorption, and c) supplement our ground-based program to place tighter constraints upon the mass of the O subdwarf. The ultimate goal is to obtain a model that can explain the diverse mass loss/accretion activity in this object. Such a model could have important consequences for other early-type stars displaying shifted, discrete absorption.|Y
MLIPC|Stellar Wind Variability in 3 0 Stars: Simultaneous UV and High S/N Optical Spectroscopy|Peter|Conti|University of Colorado|The prime goal of this proposal is to obtain simultaneous highresolution ultraviolet and high S/N optical spectra of three bright O stars. These stars are known to have strongly variable absorption components in their UV P Cygni profiles and have recently shown remarkable optical line variability, provisionally interpreted as arising from Non-Radial Pulsations. The timescales of both variabilities are comparable (hours). It is expected that the study proposed will give quantitative information on a suspected connection between the origin of stellar wind variability and stellar pulsation properties of massive stars in general. In addition it will allow us to put strong constraints on current models for the origin and formation of the discrete high-velocity absorption components as seen in ultraviolet spectra of most OB and many Be stars.|Y
MLIPM|Hot Stars in Nearby Galaxies|Philip L.|Massey|Noao|We are proposing to continue our 2 year long program of studying the hot, massive stars of nearby galaxies. This project is aimed at understanding how stellar winds are modified by metallicity, and to study the UV extinction laws in other galaxies. Our results so far have been surprising: the resonance lines of hot stars in M31 and M33 are all weaker than those of their galactic counterparts, with no sign of P Cygni emission, and low terminal velocities. Futhermore, the UV extinction law in both M33 and M31 resembles that of the LMC or SMC, being steeper and with a smaller 2200 A feature. We have looked at far too few stars to draw any conclusion as to whether these are galaxian properties of each system or simply peculiar: we need more shifts now to look at additional stars, and to complete wavelength coverage for those stars for which we have only partial coverage.|Y

MLJCG|UV Observations of Three O Giants|Catharine D.|Garmany|Colorado - CASA|We propose to obtain coordinated time resolved IUE high resolution spectra, middle infrared (10 - 34 micron) photometry, and high resolution high SIN optical spectroscopy of three bright O giants. The program stars have been seen to exhibit rapid variations in the discrete absorption components in their UV spectra, are variable in the infrared region, and show variable He I optical lines in the form of "moving bumps." The planned observations are expected to constrain models for the physical origin of discrete absorption components, which are a very common phenomenon in UV P Cygni profiles of luminous O and B and Be stars. In particular we seek to establish the role of radially propagating density enhancements in the stellar wind and a possible relation with stellar surface phenomena.|Y
MLJEB|Mass Loss in Population I Cepheids|Erika|Bohm-Vitense|University of Washington|It has been proposed by several authors that Cepheids lose mass during their pulsational cycle. due to outwards propagating shockwaves. The S Mus system offers a unique opportunity to check this hypothesis directly. The Cepheid has a main sequence companion with a temperature of about 17,700K. which means a spectral type of B4 V. This star is hot enough that the ultraviolet circumstellar and stellar wind lines can be observed, if present, with high resolution SWP images. On the other hand, it is cool enough that it is not a stellar wind source itself. The apparent visual magnitude of the companion is inferred to be mv ~ 7. The Cepheid has E(B-V) = 0.27. The orbital period is 506 days. so the companion is close enough that circumstellar material and stellar wind material still has high enough densities to be observable in the spectrum of the companion. There is no other known system with such favorable properties. Stellar wind lines can be recognized by their velocities and widths and variations during the orbital cycle. Circurnstellar lines, resting in the binary system, can be distinguished from interstellar lines by means of their velocity difference. We want to search for evidence of mass loss of the Cepheid by studying the companion spectrum during different orbital and pulsational phases, and see whether lines, normally seen in interstellar gas, can be seen to vary, which would show that they are circumstellar. The equivalent widths of the lines will show the amount of circumstellar material. The width or wavelength shift of the lines determines the velocity field.|Y
MLJFB|Unusual Mass Loss/Accretion Phenomena of the O Subdwarf HD 128220B|Frederick C.|Bruhweiler|Catholic University|Our investigations reveal the bright O subdwarf, HD 128220 B, to be one of the most unusual examples of mass loss/accretion activity of any object so far studied with the IUE. Sharp, shifted variable absorption in C IV and Si IV, in up to five distinct components, displaced at both negative and positive velocities has been seen at one time. The binary, HD 128220 AD, is very peculiar in that visual results show that H-alpha sometimes is in emission and indicate the mass of HD 128220 B is quite large and likely to be a precursor to a supernova. Yet, the behavior of the observed shifted features is remarkably similar to those seen in normal O and B stars. We propose a a continuation of our combined IUE and ground-based study of this system to: a) establish the origin of the H-alpha and determine if the UV features arise due to interactions between the stellar components, b) probe the short and long timescale variability of the shifted absorption, and c) supplement our ground-based program to place tighter constraints upon the mass of the O subdwarf. The ultimate goal is to obtain a model that can explain the diverse mass loss/accretion activity in this object. Such a model could have important consequences for other early-type stars displaying shifted, discrete absorption.|Y
MLJPM|Hot Stars in Nearby Galaxies|Philip L.|Massey|Noao KPNO|We are proposing to continue our 3 year long program of studying the hot, massive stars of nearby galaxies. This project is aimed at understanding how stellar winds are modified by metallicity, and to study the UV extinction laws in other galaxies. Our results so far have been surprising: the resonance lines of hot stars in M31 and M33 are all weaker than those of their galactic counterparts, with no sign of P Cygni emission, and low terminal velocities. Furthermore, the UV extinction law in both M33 and M31 resembles that of the LMC or SMC, being steeper and with a smaller 2200 A feature. We have looked at far too few stars to draw any conclusions as to whether these are galaxian properties of each system, or simply peculiar; we need more shifts now to look at additional stars, and to complete wavelength coverage for those stars for which we have only partial coverage. New optical data obtained this year have identified many excellent targets for pursuing these studies.|Y
MLJRS|UV Observations of the Southern Star HR 3126|Robert|Stencel|University of Colorado|The M-type bright giant star HR 3126, which lies at the center of the butterfly-shaped reflection nebula, IC2220, is an unusual object by any measure. At present, we have only optical and near infrared observations. Based on these alone, it seems just as likely that HR3126 is an evolved red star with bipolar mass ejecta, or an R Aquarii-like symbiotic binary with extended interaction effluent.  If HR 3126 is indeed an evolved red star inside a planetary nebula, it contradicts our normal understanding of stellar evolution at the planetary nebula ejection phase, because the central star hardly looks like a hot subdwarf. If indeed a binary, this object, like R Aqr, would be one of the very rare instances where the spatially extended source could be studied in detail, including mapping of its jets. In either event, we feel that observations in the ultra-violet by the IUE satellite will prove to be extremely important in our understanding of this enigmatic object. Note that no UV observations of this source have been made thus far.|Y
MLKCG|Stellar Winds in the Magellanic Clouds|Catharine|Garmany|University of Colorado|We wish to continue a program begun last year to obtain high dispersion IUE spectra of selected main sequence O stars in the Magellanic Clouds for the purpose of determining accurate mass loss rates. The Magellanic Clouds are an ideal site for testing the theoretical prediction that mass loss depends on the metallicity, as well as luminosity. In addition, a correct understanding of mass loss rates will help to constrain evolutionary models for massive stars, which have been shown by Sn 1987A to be incomplete. Analysis of low dispersion spectra has confirmed some predictions of line driven wind theory (wind terminal velocity) but the actual mass loss rates derived from these spectra are larger than predicted by the line driven wind theory. In order to find out if this difference is a problem in the theory, or the result of using low resolution data, we require high dispersion line profiles to compare with theoretical models. Kudritzki and his group have begun wind ionization calculations that can be used to determine empirical mass loss rates from these wind profiles, with a proper treatment of the ionization balance. We have demonstrated with this years data that the quality of the high dispersion spectra are quite suitable for this analysis. Now we seek additional spectra to cover the appropriate range in temperature and luminosity. These exposures require two shifts of low radiation time: we are again proposing to do this jointly with our colleagues from Munich by combining US1 and Vilspa time.|Y
MLKJN|Stellar Wind Variability of O Stars|Joy|Nichols-Bohlin|CSC IUE|The prime goal of this proposal is to investigate the nature of the recently discovered quasi-periodic behavior of the "discrete absorption components' in UV resonance lines in a few well-selected O stars, and also to study a possible link with non-radial pulsation behavior using simultaneous optical information. Earlier detailed studies have shown that discrete components appear around -1000 km/s, become stronger during their acceleration (in less than a day) and weaker at their specific terminal velocity (which takes days). A new discrete component appears quasi-periodically on a time scale of days in the very few cases studied and is suspected to be correlated with the rotation rate of the star. If this can be confirmed it will put very strong constraints on current models of stellar wind variability in O stars.|Y
MLKPM|Stellar Winds in Nearby Galaxies|Philip|Massey|KPNO|We are proposing to continue our 4 year long program of studying the hot, massive stars of nearby galaxies. This project is aimed at understanding how stellar winds are modified by metallicity, and to study the UV extinction laws in other galaxies. Our exposures on these faint stars have been extraordinarily successful, and our results astonishing: the resonance lines of hot stars in M31 and M33 are all weaker than those of their Galactic counterparts, with no sign of P Cygni emission, and low terminal velocities (Hutchings, Massey, Bianchi 1987 Ap. J. Lett., 322, L79). Our optical data is also suggestive of differences in the stellar wind laws of massive stars in M31. In addition, we have found that the UV extinction law in both M33 and M31 resembles that of the LMC or SMC, being steeper and with a smaller 2200 A feature. These results imply a major revision in our thinking about stellar wind laws and how they differ in different environments, but the number of objects we have so far obtained (3 in each galaxy) is very meager, and it is possible that the stars we have examined thus far are merely the pathological, as they tend to be the brightest. It is therefore crucial to confirm these results for additional stars, and to begin to probe differences within a galaxy such as might be expected to be seen as a function of galactocentric distances. With new ground-based techniques (multi-object, fiber-fed spectroscopy on the KPNO 4-m) we are now obtaining spectra of a large sampling of hot stars, allowing us to pick the best additional candidates for these IUE studies.|Y
MLNEB|Mass Loss of B3 to B6 Main Sequence Stars|Erika H.|Bohm-Vitense|U Washington|Mass Loss for early type stars down to B2 has been observed in CIV, SiIV and Si III lines. In these lines nothing has been seen for stars later than B2. This does not exclude the possibility that winds may he observed in lower ionization resonance lines like those of Fe II, Mn II or Si II. We want to study whether such cool stellar winds can be detected for single, slowly rotating B3 to B6 main sequence, non Be stars.|Y
MLOAB|Completion of a Magnitude-Limited Survey of Single Non-Variable G Supergiants|Alexander|Brown|Colorado - JILA|In IUE Year 14, we began a program (GSNAB) to answer the following questions: Where does the transition region (TR) dividing line' occur for massive (K > 6 M(sun) stars?  Is there, in fact, any dividing line for these stars, or does past evolution rather than current position in the HR diagram control the outer atmospheric structure of Gtype supergiants? We are studying a brightness-limited sample (with V < 4.8) of single, non-variable G supergiants, that includes all such stars within roughly 800 parsecs of the Sun for Ib supergiants and 4 kpc for Is supergiants. We request an additional 3 US1 shifts to complete this project. The outer atmospheric structure of G supergiants is presently poorly understood. We shall determine the relative frequency of coronal, non-coronal, and hybrid outer atmospheric structure among these stars, The range of chromospheric and TR properties will be quantitatively investigated using emission measure analysis and radiative transfer modelling. Observed CNO abundances, ^12C/^13C ratios, and IR excesses will be used to study correlations between the atmospheric properties and the evolutionary state of the stars. The atmospheric structure will hopefully be related to major alterations of the stellar internal structure, such as changes in convection zone depth, angular momentum distribution and the onset of He-core burning.|Y

MMNSB|The Maunder-Minimum Phase of Solar-Type Stars in the Ultraviolet|Sallie L.|Baliunas|Harvard CFA - SAO|We propose observations and analysis of Mg II h and k line profiles and fluxes as well as the chromospheric and transition-region fluxes of C II and C IV in a small sample of solar-type stars. The surface magnetic activity (Ca II H and K relative fluxes) of the selected solar-type stars has been monitored for over two decades at Mount Wilson Observatory. Analysis of the Ca II magnetic activity records suggests that solar-type stars spend most of their time in a cyclic state, with periodicities roughly on the order of a decade. However, solar-type stars apparently spend some time in a prolonged lull in magnetic activity, denoted by low and nearly constant values of magnetic activity and assumed to be similar to the Sun's Maunder Minimum. We intend to compare the ultraviolet chromospheric and transition-region properties of the cyclic magnetic state to the Maunderminimum state of the solar-type stars, and compare them both to the known range of the Sun's variability. From the ultraviolet data we will construct model atmospheres and chromospheres of the solar-type stars and compare them to models of the Sun.|Y
MMOCU|Intensive Multiwavelength Monitoring of the Blazar 3C279|C. Megan|Urry|STScI|We propose a month-long IUE campaign to monitor intensively the unique blazar 3C279, for correlation with studies at other wavelengths, notably including -y-rays. 3C279 is one of the brightest and most violently variable blazars known, and the recent discovery of its strong, variable -y-ray emission marks it as the brightest AGN in the -y-ray sky. The -Y-ray emission can be understood, in the context of existing inhomogeneous relativistic jet models, as Compton-scattered radiation from the optical-ultraviolet range. The proposed highdensity, regularly sampled observations are designed to detect and correlate the continuum variations expected on time scales of few days. Together with the superluminal motion measured with VLBI, the simultaneously measured broad-band spectra and variability, extending up to -y-rays, will provide an essentially model-independent estimate of the relativistic beaming factor. This IUE campaign, in coordination with the already-approved GRO observation, offers a unique opportunity to test the relativistic jet paradigm, and to determine separately the bulk velocity, the viewing angle, and the physical parameters of the jet (magnetic field, relativistic electron energy density, dimensions, etc.). Simultaneous ROSAT monitoring is being proposed, and the campaign will also cover optical, infrared, and radio wavelengths, including multiwavelength VLBI mapping.|Y
MMOSB|The Maunder-Minimum Phase of Old K-Dwarf Stars in the Ultraviolet|Sallie L.|Baliunas|Harvard CFA - SAO|We propose observations and analysis of chromospheric and transition-region fluxes of C II, C IV, Mg II and Ca II of a small sample of old, K-dwarf stars, According to 25 years of Ca II H and K magnetic activity records from Mount Wilson Observatory, three of the five target stars currently show periodic magnetic activity on timescales of a decade, similar to the sun's 11-year cycle. Another star has been in a Maunder-minimum state (e.g., low and flat magnetic activity) since roughly 1981; the remaining star had been in the minimum state since at least 1966, but in 1989, the star began a slow increase in activity.  The ultraviolet spectra of the K-dwarf stars will be compared to similar IUE observations of solar-type stars made in 1991. We intend to model and compare the cyclic and Maunder-minimum states of magnetic activity of the sun, solar-type stars and the old, K-dwaxf stars.|Y
MMPSA|Elemental Abundances of Mercury-Manganese Stars|Saul J.|Adelman|The Citadel|We propose to obtain a carefully planned set of multiple high dispersion exposures of three MercuryManganese stars in both the SWP and LWP cameras. These observations will be coadded to increase the S/N ratio so that accurate elemental abundances can be derived for these examples of HgMn stars, each of which represents some extreme class aspect. This will increase of sample of HgMn stars from four to seven. Of particular interest are the abundances of N and Co in which some HgMn stars have shown remarkable underabundances. Comparison of the UV and optical spectra features due to light elements such as N (and C and 0) provide an observational framework to test NLTE models such as those of Takada (1993). This work has already shed some light on some of earlier findings for normal stars. The ability to accurately determine the surface chemical composition of the late B stars through such studies will lead to better tests for theories purporting to explain the origin of the chemical peculiarities seen in this temperature domain.|Y
MOPMC|Variation of the Solar Lyman-Alpha Line Profile with Solar Activity|Michael R.|Combi|U Michigan|The integrated line flux of the solar Lyman-alpha line is known to vary with the 11-year solar cycle as well as with the 27-day solar rotation. The nature of the variation of the shape of the line profile with solar activity is, however, the subject of some controversy. Reconstructions of direct observations indicate that the level of the self-reversed center of the line varies with a larger amplitude than does the integrated flux. However, indirect analysis from observations of the interstellar medium are consistent with the line-center varying in proportion to the integrated flux. We propose to observe the solar Lyman-alpha profile as reflected from the Moon with IUE for a second year using the small aperture in high spectral resolution mode. Observations during the previous year obtained during US2 shifts demonstrate the feasibility of using IUE for this purpose. US1 observations would yield much less radiation noise. Four shifts would be scheduled approximately 27 days in advance so that two line profiles each could be obtained at relatively active and quiet solar conditions with effective integrations of ~15 hours. Such information is important for understanding the formation of the H line-profile in the atmosphere of the sun, and also for the interpretation of Lyman-alpha observations of the earth's H geocorona, planetary and cometary hydrogen, and the interstellar wind.|Y
MOPNM|Main-Sequence O Stars in NGC 6231: Enhanced Winds|Nancy D.|Morrison|U Toledo|Three late O-type main-sequence stars in the open cluster NGC 6231 will be observed with IUE at high dispersion, and their C IV and N V resonance-line profiles will be studied. From low-dispersion IUE observations, 10 members of the cluster have been found to have anomalously strong C IV resonance lines for their spectral types. Massa, Savage, and Cassinelli (1984) observed two of these "UV peculiar" stars (spectral types B0.5 V and B1 V) at high dispersion. They found that the C IV lines have a strong, broad, shortward-shifted absorption component, which suggests a greatly enhanced wind relative to the average for the spectral type. They proposed that the enhancement is due to an overabundance of C. Recently, however, Grigsby, Gordon, Morrison, and Zimba (1992) showed from optical spectra that these stars have normal C abundances. Thus, there is not yet a convincing explanation for these strikingly anomalous stellar winds.  By extending the temperature range over which the phenomenon has been studied at high dispersion, however, we expect to gain new physical information. From wind modeling of the line profiles, we will derive mass-loss rates and terminal velocities, and we will test whether these winds are described by radiation-driven wind theory.|Y

MPJAM|Hires IUE Observations of the Peculiar Stars RX Puppis and R Aquarii|Andrew G.|Michalitsianos|NASA/GSFC|The symbiotic variables R Aquarii and RX Puppis exhibit a variety of emission properties over a wide range of wavelengths that includes centimeter, IR, X-ray, optical as well as intense emission in the near and far-UV. They are regarded as prototypes for detailed investigation of the symbiotic phenomena, because the morphology discerned with high spatial radio continuum maps indicate jet, or collimated flow from these systems. We have undertaken a detailed study of these objects in order to determine the UV line and continuum emission properties of these systems in context with the radio morphology. Recently obtained IUE spectra of R Aqr (M7e+pec) indicate that the region of maximum UV line emission appears displaced relative to the suspected location of the Mira and hot subdwarf, which are surrounded in a compact HII region. This is indicated from LORES-SWP spectra by a systematic wavelength shift evident in most of the high excitation UV emission lines in the direction of the jet; the 10x20" aperture of IUE is centered at the radio position that corresponds to the HII region, and the position angle of the aperture is oriented so that the dispersion of the SWP-LORES camera is closely aligned with the axis by the radio emitting features which comprise the jet. When the large IUE entrance aperture is recentered at radio Feature-A (approximately 2.7 NE from the HIT region), the high excitation emission lines of C IV, He II, Si III] and C III] appear at their respective nominal wavelengths, providing further evidence that the compact HII region, which is the brightest component in 6-cm radio continuum maps, is not the primary source of high excitation UV line emission, as previously assumed. We propose collaborative NASA-ESA, HIRES-SWP observations of the central HII region surrounding R Aqr, enabling us to examine for the first time the line profile properties of strong high excitation resonance and intercombination emission lines for velocity and spatially extended structure with ~0.1A resolution. These observations may have direct application to more distant and spatially unresolved symbiotics. For example, the C IV emission doublet recently observed in HIRES-SWP spectra of the nebular jet (feature B) region in R Aqr, reveals multi-component structure, similar to that seen in RX Puppis. But recently obtained sub-arcsecond VLA observations of RX Puppis indicates it also possesses a jet, reminiscent of the R Aqr radio morphology, but smaller in scale owing to its greater distance. Collaborative (NASA-ESA) deep SWPHIRES exposures of RX Puppis are requested in order to properly expose the broad wings of the C IV doublet and other high excitation emission lines, for comparison with the line profile structure of the central HII region of R Aqr. Similarity of line profile structure may be generally indicative of collimated mass expulsion in a subset of symbiotic stars which are strong emitters at centimeter wavelengths, and which contain Mira-type variable.|Y

MRITA|Long-Term Cycles in the Magnetic Active Regions of Cool Stars|Thomas R.|Ayres|Colorado - CASA|Long-term activity cycles, believed to be analogous to the 11 year solar cycle, have been discovered on numerous late-type stars through ground-based Ca II observations. The most valuable activity diagnostics, however, are emission features found in the ultraviolet: UV emission features available in IUE spectra are formed over a wide range of physical conditions in the active layers of stellar atmospheres, and are free of the photospheric contamination suffered by Ca II. We therefore propose to search for and study stellar activity cycles using data collected by the IUE. We have chosen a set of program stars which are well-represented in the Archives, and propose a multiyear program of continued monitoring of these stars.  We believe that the development of a complete theory of stellar activity will ultimately require the compilation of a large data base concerning empirical properties of activity cycles. Our proposed program will provide the first extensive, ultraviolet data set of this type.  The key to the success of our project will be to analyze all data in a systematic and consistent fashion. We therefore intend to reprocess relevant Archive images using the latest calibrations and ITFs, and to measure line fluxes in all new and existing images using automated software in order to ensure homogeneity of the data analysis procedures.|Y

MSINE|Fluxes, Temperatures, and Radii of Satrs Defining the Zams|Nancy Remage|Evans|CSC|This project is to obtain flux distributions for Pleiades stars in the A and B spectral range from 1200 to 3200 Angstroms, and similar observations of the stars with accurate trigonometric parallaxes which are used to calibrate the distance to the Pleiades. This will allow us to set up a sequence of IUE observations defining the zero age main sequence (ZAMS). With these data we will be able to produce improved individual bolometric corrections and temperatures because the ultraviolet and visual data cover the wavelength range where most of the flux is radiated. Since the distances to the stars are known, the IUE observations plus temperatures from models produce a temperatureradius calibration for the main sequence. Alternately, since angular diameters have been measured for most of the trigonometric parallax stars, the distances, radii and ultraviolet fluxes provide a test of the model atmosphere fluxes in that wavelength region. For the Pleiades stars, several derivations of radii will be compared, including IRAS results. The radius results, combined with the distances and fluxes provide a further test of the atmosphere models.|Y

MSJLW|A Stars in the Pleiades|Lee Anne|Willson|Iowa|We propose to observe selected A stars in the Pleiades in the long wavelength region at high resolution to search for signatures of mass loss. Mass loss rates sufficiently high to be observable with IUE, and sufficiently high force these stars to evolve down the main sequence, has been suggested by Willson, Bowen and Struck-Marcell (1987). This mass loss is expected to be highest for rapidly rotating stars, and to be somewhat concentrated towards the equatorial zones, so the stars with the largest vsini values are expected to show the strongest P Cygni profiles. We propose to observe 8-10 Pleiades A stars at high resolution, covering the range In spectral subclass and vsini. As these observations will occupy typically 2/3-3/4 of a US1 shift, we also plan to obtain low resolution spectra of as many of the unobserved Pleiades A stars as we can fit Into the remainder of each shift.|Y
MSJRP|Fluxes, Temperatures, and Radii of Stars Defining the Zams|Ronald E.|Pitts|CSC|We propose to obtain flux distributions for 0, B, and A type main sequence stars in the open clusters of Alpha Per and NGC 2244. These observations, combined with observations of the Pleiades stars from our 9th episode program, will allow us to set up a sequence of IUE observations defining the upper zero age main sequence (ZAMS). With these data we will be able to produce improved individual bolometric corrections and effective temperatures because the combined ultraviolet and visual data cover the wavelength range where the majority of the flux is radiated for most of these stars. Within this group, we have included 9 low-rotation stars with v sini < 100 km/sec to check for possible effects due to rotation. Since the distances to the stars are known, the IUE observations plus temperatures from models produce a temperature-radius calibration for the zero age main sequence. For the overall program, including 9th episode observations of Pleiades stars and nearby non-cluster stars of similar spectral type with accurate trigonometric parallaxes, several derivations of radii will be compared, including direct and indirectly measured angular diameters. The radii results, combined with the distances and observed fluxes, provide a consistency test of the model atmospheres employed.|Y
MSLHJ|Ultraviolet Spectra and Chromospheres of S and Ms Stars|Hollis R.|Johnson|Indiana|Our objectives for this proposal are: (1) to study the outer atmosphere of a bright S star and an KS star in detail with chromospheric models and (2) to use 14S and S stars covering a range of C/O ratio to investigate the changes that occur In chromospheres as the surface composition changes during AGB evolution. Previous research has demonstrated that, while the spectra of warm carbon stars (early R stars) are similar to C and K giants, the cool carbon stars (late R and N stars) have Mg II emission fluxes 10-50 times smaller than M giants and show enhanced low excitation lines of neutral metals in their photospheric spectra. The S stars. having C/O ratios intermediate between the M giants and C stars, may play a key role in our understanding of the apparent dependence of chromospheric and outer photospheric structure on chemical abundance. The few brighter ones we have observed indeed have Mg II fluxes that span a large range, but the narrow range of C/O ratios represented in these few bright S stars precludes further deductions. For our first goal we will obtain a high-dispersion LWP spectrum of HR 1105. the brightest non-Mira type S star. and 4 omicron 1 Ori, a bright M3S star; these full-shift exposures will yield spectra of sufficient quality to allow us to begin modeling the outer atmosphere. The second goal requires obtaining low-dispersion LWP spectra of a few (4) fainter S stars.|Y

To identify the UV spectral features observed, to estimate their relative stengths and to derive line profile data where feasible for comparison with theoretical models. To attempt to correlate peculiarities observed in ground-based spectra with line stengths observed in the UV.  To utilize the observed condition, of excitation and ionization to investigate the atmospheric structure and radiation field at small standard optical depths, particularly in comparison to normal stars of similar color or spectral type.  To determine if variable spectral line blocking can account in all cases for the photometric variability of magnetic stars and if so, to establish what lines are responsible. To determine to what degree the deficiency of UV flux in the blue Bp and Ap stars is a consequence of a) continuum processes, B) "specific" line blocking by ions whose lines at visible wavelengths are known to be enhanced e.g. the rare earths, C) an enhanced "general" line blocking by the vast number of linen present shortward of 3000 A in all B and A stars. To determine the absolute ultraviolet flux distribution of the Ap, Bp and magnetic variable stars to within the limits of uncertainty of the instrumental calibration, with the aim of estimating their bolometric corrections and where possible, their luminosities and effective temperatures.|Y
MWOJL|A Multiwavelength Campaign of Active Stars w/Intermediate Rotation Rates|Jeffrey L.|Linsky|Colorado - JILA|Although the Sun is a very slowly-rotating (v, sin i = 2 km s^-1) inactive star, images made in high temperature UV emission lines reveal bright plage regions located above or near dark sunspots. This indicates that magnetic fields control the local heating rate, density and energy balance even for an inactive star. Very active rapidly rotating stars like AR Lac show bright plage regions that are spatially correlated with dark starspots. In this proposal we ask the question: Do moderately active stars with moderately rapid rotation (v sin i = 20-30 km s^-1) show the same pattern? Intuitively, we would answer yes, but astrophysics is full of non-intuitive surprises, and this question has never been answered. We will test this hypothesis by obtaining spectra of the Mg II and C IV 1548, 1550A lines to study the size and location of plages in the chromosphere and transition region of a dwarf and a giant star which both have v sin i - 25 km s^-1. We will use the CIII] 1909A and SiIII] 1892A intersystem lines to study the electron density and the amount of 30,000 to 60,000 K material in the plage transition regions. A unique aspect of our program will be the simultaneous ground based and IUE observations to provide details on the spatial, temperature, pressure and magnetic properties of inhomogeneities in the outer atmosphere. This will lead to a fairly complete, 3-dimensional picture of these active stars from the photosphere to the transition region and, in one case, the corona. The two target systems have the same rotation rates but very different gravities: IM Peg is a 24 day system with a K1 giant, primary, whereas V815 Her is a 1.8 day system with a G5 dwarf primary. We wish to study these different systems to determine whether a factor of 100 deference in gravity changes the spatial relation between spots and plages and whether it changes the temperature-density structures in the plage regions appreciably. It is important to observe both stars, but the program would still be interesting if only one target is approved.|Y

These new data will be combined with previous IUE SWP and LWR spectra of M8 and M42 to study (1) the general gaseous phase carbon abundance in galactic H II regions, (2) the variation of the gaseous phase carbon abundances as a function of galactocentric distance, (3) nucleosynthesis of CNO elements in stars and enrichment processes and timescales, and (4) gaseous phase abundances and dust depletions of silicon and magnesium in the! interstellar medium.|Y
NAESM|A Abundance in Planetary Nebula of Fornax Galaxy|Stephen P.|Maran|NASA/GSFC|We propose to detect and measure the ultraviolet spectrum of the planetary nebula in the Fornax dwarf galaxy and to combine the UV data with existing visual-wavelength spectrometry to compute an ionization model. we will determine improved physical parameters for the nebula and its central star and will make the first determination of the carbon abundance in the nebula. We also will compute improved abundances for He, N, 0, and Ar. These results will be compared with our earlier findings on planetary nebulae in the Magellanic Clouds and with data on planetary nebulae in the Galaxy, including nebulae that on population grounds may be physically similar to the Fornax planetary. The Fornax system is a dwarf spheroidal galaxy of lower metallicity than the Galaxy, the IMC, and the SMC. The existing but weak data on the Fornax planetary suggest that it had a second generation. stellar progenitor. This is significant because the evidence from the giant branch and from globular clusters that the Fornax galaxy contains second generation stars, although some find it suggestive, is not compelling. We will use our more reliable composition determination for the Fornax planetary nebula to discuss the single stellar generation model for the Fornax galaxy in the context of the other evidence.|Y

In addition to computergenerated plots of flux vs. wavelength, the atlas will contain information on exposure times, 1950 coordinates of the objects, an overview of the morphology of the spectra, an emission line identification list and emission line fluxes for a few selected objects. A tape copy of all spectra will be furnished to the RDAFs for future use. The production of the atlas will be coordinated with similar programs for atlases of O stars and B stars.|Y

NBIRD|IUE Observations of Nebulosity Around AG CArinae|Reginald J.|Dufour|Rice University|We propose to obtain low dispersion IUE SWP and LWP spectra of two regions in the shell nebula surrounding the P Cygni star AG Carinae. Recently obtained groundbased spectra at CTIO indicate that this nebula may have a peculiar chemical composition whereby oxygen, neon, and argon are deficient relative to hydrogen. The proposed IUE spectra should provide valuable information on the abundances of other astrophysically important elements such as carbon, silicon, and magnesium. They should also enable an improved assessment of the dust content of the nebula from the UV continuum of the nebula compared to that of the star. Such information will be useful in adding to our rather sparse knowledge of pre-supernova mass loss and chemical enrichment processes in massive stars.|Y
NBJHB|The Close-Binary Nucleus of the Planetary Nebula HFG 1|Howard E.|Bond|STScI|HFG1 is a large, high-excitation, low-surface-brightness planetary nebula whose 14th-mag central star has recently found to be a very close binary with an orbital period of 14 hours.  The binary companion of the very hot primary is believed to be a cool main-sequence star.  Because of its close proximity to the primary, one hemispher of the companion suffers considerable heating. The heated hemispher is responsible for the light variability, whose amplitude in the B band is an enormous 1.1 mag.  Ground-based spectroscopic observations have revealed a high-excitation emission-line spectrum that varies synchronously with orbital phase.  These emission lines appear to arise in the irradiated hemisphere of the secondary.  This proposal requests IUE observations that will be made a various times around the orbital cycle.  The aims of the program include determination of the effective temperature and other properties of the primary star, determination of the interstellare reddening and distance of the system, and study of the orbital variation of the UV emission lines.  Aside from its intrisic interest, this remarkable binary is of importance in broader contexts of the origin of planetary nebulae and the progenitors of the cataclysmic binaries.|Y
NBKWF|A Study of Bipolar Nebulae and Protoplanetary Objects|Walter A.|Feibelman|NASA/GSFC|We will obtain low dispersion spectra of 3 bipolar nebulae (representing a subgroup with common spectral and geometric characteristics) considered to be in a transition to the planetary nebula stage. Very few of these objects are known and few have been studied with IUE. As evidenced by the attention lavished on them in recent IAU Symposia (#103 and #131), it is clear that they form an important but as yet poorly understood link in the likely sequence of AGB-OR/IR-PN evolution. Despite their substantial reddening implied from visual spectra, current dust-torus models for these systems and our previous IUE observations indicate much lower reddening toward the central stars, bipolar nebulae, and possibly the inner regions of the tori. We have obtained preliminary results with IUE and propose a more detailed study of MI-92, Ml91, and M3-28 to determine the spectral types, measure emission line fluxes, and determine physical processes in these systems.|Y

NCBJH|Studies of Suspected High Carbon Abundance Planetary Nebulae|J. Patrick|Harrington|Maryland|We propose to undertake a study of suspected high carbon abundance planetary nebulae. The quantitative assessment of carbon enrichment in these objects can provide critical insight toward an understanding of (1) various convective mixing processes which may have taken place in nebular progenitors and (2) the detailed thermal structure of planetary nebulae themselves. The International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) affords the opportunity to observe both the C III] 1909 A and C IV 1549 A emission lines in planetary nebulae of moderate to high excitation. In conjunction with requisite numerical modeling of individual nebulae, measurement of these line intensities will provide the most unambiguous determination of elemental carbon abundances. Our proposed observational effort would be directed toward nebulae of moderate surface brightness, suspected on the basis of previous optical recombination line and radio molecular line studies of being carbon-rich.|Y
NCHWF|The Eclipsing Nucleus of the Planetary Nebula NGC 2346|Walter A.|Feibelman|NASA/GSFC|The eclipsing binary nucleus of the planetary nebula NGC 2346 began to show eclipses in 1980, with no eclipses reported prior to this date. The maxima became progressively fainter, dropping from a value of approx. Mv=11.3 to below 15 and the entire shape of the light curve changed dramatically. A very recent IBVS (Marino and Williams 1984) indicates that the maxima are returning to a brighter level. The 15.991 day radial velocity period has remained constant. We obtained IUE observations of NGC 2346 in 1981,1982, and 1983, but not in 1984. The unique behaviour of the nucleus of this planetary nebula is interpreted as being the result of a dark dust cloud intervening in our line of sight.|Y
NCIRF|Peculair Abundances in the Crab Nebula's Filaments|Robert A.|Fesen|Colorado - CASA|Investigations into the elemental abundances of supernova remnants can provide invaluable information concerning the properties of the progenitor star as well as details of stellar nucleosynthesis. In this regard, the Crab Nebula is especially useful, it being the youngest supernova remnant observable with IUE. Despite being fairly heavily reddened, UV emission-lines from its filaments have been successfully obtained many times early in the history of IUE.  These UV spectra provided important and unique data for determining elemental composition of the filamentary ejecta, especially for C, N, and O. Analysis of these data by Davidson et al (1982) indicated nearly solar C/O and N/O ratios despite the large general enrichment of helium in the remnant. Although not realized at the time, there is considerable recent evidence which indicates that significant abundance variations do exist among the filaments. The strongest anomalies in composition are puzzlingly confined to a few relatively bright northern filaments which exhibit nearly solar He abundance yet show possibly large Ni enrichment.  If we hope to understand the elemental composition of remnants in general and the Crab Nebula in particular, we then need to determine the composition of these peculiar filaments and to what extent they differ from the rest of the remnant. Towards that goal, we therefore propose to obtain IUE low dispersion SWP spectra on the brightest of these peculiar filaments where we have already obtained matching optical data. Analysis will follow that of Davidson el al but with much more detailed photoionization models for the Crab already developed by us. These data should help determine the true range of abundances present in the Crab's filamentary ejecta.|Y

Recent observations by Marino and Williams (1984) indicated that the maxima are returning to a brighter level, as was also confirmed by our IUE observations in early 1985. The 15.991 day radial velocity period has remained constant. The unique behavior of the nucleus of this planetary nebula is interpreted as being the result of a dark dust cloud intervening in our line of eight.|Y
NCKPH|Carbon Abundance Variations in the SMC|Paul W.|Hodge|Washington|Although there have been many studies of H II regions in the Magellanic Clouds, one aspect of the field still needs exploration. Optical studies, especially of young star clusters (Mateo 1987). have shown that there is a large spread in heavy element abundances. but the studies of H II regions (Pagel et al. 1978. Dufour 1987, and many other references) have not shown this effect. Since carbon is more accessible at IUE wavelengths than at visible. we propose to further extend the study of carbon abundances by obtaining IUE spectra of additional SMC H II regions.|Y

Orion has a wealth of information available which would allow a more complete picture of the scattering process to be developed and subsequently a more accurate determination of the UV properties of the dust.

NDBPP|Surface Mapping of Bright Emission Line Extended Objects|Peter M.|Perry|CSC|It is proposed that low-dispersion ultraviolet spectra (1135-3255A) of extended galactic emission-line objects be obtained with the IUE scientific instrument. Spectra obtained at a number of contiguous locations defining a mosaic within the program object will be used to generate monochromatic images of high spatial resolution at the wavelengths of the strong ultraviolet emission lines. Emphasis will be placed on obtaining reasonably comprehensive observations of specifically selected regions of two objects: NGC 1976 (the Orion Nebula), where observations will be concentrated in regions of known supersonic velocity (Perry et al 1976), and NGC 6960 (the Cygnus Loop). Image processing techniques will be fully exploited to generate and analyze these ultraviolet surface maps and compare them to existing imagery in other wavelength domains (e.g. X-ray and visible). The new ultraviolet results, combined with the data from other wavelength regions, should yield improved insight into the physical processes, particularly shockwave phenomena, occurring in the regions to be studied.|Y
NDBRD|Observations of the UV Spectra of HII Regions in the Magellanic Clouds and Type I Planetary Nebulae|Reginald J.|Dufour|Rice University|We propose to study the ultraviolet spectra of several HII regions in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds and the spectra of several Type I galactic planetary nebulae using the International Ultraviolet Explorer satellite. The primary objective is to accurately measure the line intensities of the UV lines of [CII], CIII], and CIV in order to accurately determine the carbon abundance in the nebulae. The UV data will be combined with ground based spectrophotometry of the nebulae and analyzed with sophisticated theoretical nebular model codes in order to calculate the relative abundances of H, He, C, N, O, Ne, S, Ar, and possibly Cl and Fe in the program nebulae. These observations should provide the first accurate determination of the primary nucleosynthesis product ratio C/O in metal poor galaxies and in planetary nebulae abnormally rich in He and N believed to have evolved from stars near the upper mass limit for planetaries. The results should provide fundamental new knowledge on the nucleosynthesis processes in galaxies and massive planetary nebulae.|Y
NDCPP|Ultraviolet Observations of Selected Features in the Orion Nebula|Peter M.|Perry|CSC|it is proposed that high dispersion spectra (,NA 1150 - 3200 A) of regions of astrophysical interest in the Orion Nebula (NGC 1976) be obtained with the IUE scientific instrument. Low dispersion IUE spectra have already been obtained at 36 contiguous locations defining a mosaic within the central region of the nebula to generate monochromatic images of high spatial resolution at the wavelengths of the strong ultraviolet emission lines CIII] 1909, CII] 2326, and [OII] 2470 (Perry et al, 1979). In the proposed work, five regions identified during the low dispersion surface-mapping program as being of particular interest will be observed in detail: three areas near 0 2 Ori A containing imbedded supersonic compact "cloudlets", an area along the bright bar representative of the typical strong-lined regions seen in the nebula, and a fifth area, along the bright bar, in which the observed surface brightness distributions of the strong CII] and [OII] lines exhibit strikingly atypical combined spatial and velocity structure. Image processing and analysis techniques already developed for the initial program will be fully exploited to analyze the new observations. The new ultraviolet data will be used to determine the physical attributes (ionization and velocity structure) of the regions studied.|Y

The significant diagnostic lines in the blue and visible regions for these nebulae are available, so that by being able to measure the diagnostic lines in the ultra-violet region, it will be possible to arrive at a much more complete analysis of these lines by combining the data from all three regions.

NDEKD|Studies of Material Ejected From ETA Carinae|Kris|Davidson|University of Minesota|During the past 200 years a large amount of material has been ejected from the very massive star Eta Carinae. Much of this material is now in the form of condensations with emission-line spectra. We have found (partly from preliminary 1981 IUE data) that these spectra give valuable information about the composition of the star's outer layers; most of the CNO there is nitrogen. These spectra are more useful than spectra of the central object because they are nebular, representative of modest densities, and therefore are not overwhelmingly complex. We propose to obtain good low-dispersion IUE spectra of one or more outlying condensations. At the same time, we propose to make a simple low-dispersion "map" of Eta Carinae's "homunculus" (inner condensations) using short exposures with the small IUE spectrograph apertures during high-radiation shifts.|Y
NDERD|High Dispersion IUE Observations of Metal-Poor H II Regions|Reginald J.|Dufour|Rice University|We propose to obtain long exposure (3-5 hour) high dispersion UV spectra of several H II regions in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds and in a few giant H II regions in late-type spiral and irregular galaxies known to be metal-poor compared to the Orion Nebula. The primary scientific objective is to determine the carbon abundance in each object from the C III] 1907/1909 lines and investigate the variation of the carbon abundance with the oxygen and nitrogen abundances in galaxies. The higher emission line to stellar continuum contrast afforded in the high dispersion spectra (compared to previously acquired low dispersion IUE spectra of many of the objects) should also enable measurement of weaker emission lines of ions such as Si III] and Mg II in some of the nebulae which could be used to study the abundances of silicon and magnesium in metal poor H II regions for the first time.|Y

NDGRD|High Dispersion IUE Observations of Material Ejected by ETA Carinae|Reginald J.|Dufour|Rice University|Previous IUE and ground-based spectra and imagery of the outer condensations near Eta Carinae have shown them to be composed of CNO cycle processed material (N- and He-rich) which has been ejected by Eta Carinae. Recently obtained IUE and groundbased (CTIO) low dispersion spectra indicate an extraordinarily complex physical situation in the condensations, particularly in the brightest, or "S", condensation. In order to better understand and model the physical and chemical properties of the condensations, new higher dispersion IUE and ground-based data are necessary. The proposed high dispersion IUE observations described herein should provide new information about the UV spectra of "S", including improved detectability of weak lines above the complex strong UV continuum, much improved wavelength determination for several currently unidentified UV emission lines, and possibly information on the velocity structure and dispersion velocities of the various ionization zones in and around the condensation.|Y

NEGWB|UV Spectra of Evolved Magellanic Cloud Supernova Remnants|William P.|Blair|CFA|We wish to obtain SWP spectra of three supernova remnants (SNRs) in the Large Magellanic Cloud and one in the Small Magellanic Cloud for purposes of studying SNR evolution and grain destruction processes in these galaxies. The UV spectra will allow us to determine the shock velocity and carbon and silicon abundances for each of the remnants. In conjunction with optical data, the shock velocity will allow us to estimate the pressure within each remnant. By determining the pressure as a function of diameter we will investigate whether the remnants are in the free expansion phase (as suggested by Mathewson et al., 1983) or the adiabatic phase (as suggested by previous investigators). The carbon and silicon abundances will be compared to results from H II regions to determine if grain destruction has taken place in the SNR shocks.|Y
NEHJR|Emission from Nova Shells|John C.|Raymond|CFA|The 10" by 20" nebula surrounding the old nova DQ Her and the 14" nebula surrounding CP Pup are interesting in themselves because of their low temperatures and enhanced abundances. They are also useful diagnostics of the system luminosities in the EUV range. The IUE exposures of the DQ Her nebula acquired so far show C II 13.36 and marginal C III] 2909, but there is no exposure having adequate exposure time and coverage of the ends of the nebula. Since the optical spectra show that [O II] and [N II] are strongly concentrated toward the ends of the nebula, it is important to obtain a good exposure there in order to understand the EUV emission spectrum. No IUE spectrum of CP Pup has been obtained.|Y
NEIRD|IUE Observations of Nebulosity Around HD 148937|Reginald J.|Dufour|Rice University|We propose to obtain low dispersion SWP and LWP IUE observations of the UV spectra of two physically different nebulosities surrounding the extreme Of star HD 148937. One nebulosity is the S-shaped nebula, NGC 6164-5, which is believed to have been recently ejected by the Of star, and for which groundbased spectra reveal it to be He- and N-rich, but O-poor. It may also have radial composition variations in N/H. The second nebulosity is a filamentary halo to the east of HD 148937 which is believed to be an interstellar bubble driven by the wind of the 04 star. Combined with previously obtained groundbased spectra, the IUE spectrophotometry will enable us to improve the determination of physical conditions and abundances in the nebulosities. The results are expected to significantly add to our knowledge about the mass loss processes and evolutionary state of HD 148937 in particular and possibly also that of luminous O stars in general.|Y
NEJRD|Stellar Enriched and Shocked Gas Associated with NGC 6888|Reginald J.|Dufour|Rice University|NGC 6888 is a large, complex, and relatively high surface brightness Wolf-Rayet shell nebula around the WN6 star HD 192163. Previously published groundbased spectrophotometry indicates that many of the brighter knots of the nebula are nitrogen and helium rich compared to galactic H II regions. Recently obtained CCD imagery in the light of several prominent emission lines indicate several physically different types of phenomena in this object, including swept up and wind-driven ISM "knots" enhanced in nitrogen and helium, filamentary "shocks" seen only in [O III] along its outer perimeter, and possibly internal stellar ejecta. We request IUE observing time to obtain deep SWP spectra of several of the more prominent features to further study their chemical composition (particularly of carbon) and physical nature.|Y
NEKPH|M31 H II Regions|Paul W.|Hodge|Washington|This proposal is intended to complete our program. begun in the 10th year of the IUE for which we have been assigned four shifts. Recent visual-wavelength observations suggest that M31's H II regions are different in several ways from typical giant H II regions in other galaxies. such as M33. We propose to obtain IUE spectra in order to add to our data base for these objects. We hope to find out what is the cause of the observed differences in brightness and morphology: is the IMF different. is it the abundances. is it related to the gas density structure or gas motions. the dust characteristics, or some other cause? Although M31 has none of the very bright giant H II regions that are found in Sc galaxies. we have chosen sonic relatively compact. high-surface-brightness H II regions that are favorable objects for the IUE|Y
NENPC|Spatially Integrated Spectroscopy of Nearby Giant HII Regions - How Many O Stars are Predicted?|Peter S.|Conti|Colorado - CASA|We wish to obtain spatially integrated IUE low resolution SWP spectra of the giant HII regions 30 Dor (LMC) and NGC346 (SMC) These will be taken at several scales from 20x2O arc second to 2x2 arc minute size so as to sample various regions of these,, objects. The far-UV continuum and wind resonance lines such as CIV and Si IV are expected to be found in these integrated spectra due to the presence of numerous 0 (and WolfRayet) stars in these nebulae. We will use these data, and stellar evolution and spectral synthesis codes, along with optical spectra we have already obtained, to predict the numbers and types of 0 (and WolfRayet) stars present. These can be compared to the actual counts of such stars available from other investigators. The comparison will help our understanding of how successful such "inverse processes" would be when used in more distant giant HII regions where stellar statistics is not possible.|Y

Using nebular models, we will use the UV spectra in association with ground-based spectra and imagery to study the ionization structure and abundances of the nebula, and the physical nature of the evaporating globule.|Y

NEQSS|Multiwavelength Observations of Nova Cygni 1992 and Nova Pup 1992 during Outbursts|Sumner|Starrfield|Arizona State University|This proposal was originally granted two-year status in the 16th Episode review. We propose to continue existing IUE programs to observe two post-explosion phase ONeMg novae that are still in outburst and bright enough to study with the IUE Satellite. Nova Cyg 1992 is the brightest nova to be observed since Nova V1500 Cygni 1975 and we have followed it since discovery. It is relatively nearby (~2 kpc) with small reddening (E(B-V) ~ 0.2). Nova Pup 1991 has been observed by IUE since shortly after discovery and it is an ONeMg nova with nearly identical evolutionary behavior to Nova Cyg 1992. Both of these novae have been observed with IUE utilizing our Target of Opportunity proposal and we can accurately determine the exposure time for each camera. Nova Cyg 1992 has also been observed by HST(GHRS and FOC), ROSAT, VOYAGER, GRO, KAO, and EUVE. We have submitted an EUVE proposal (September 1993) to study it in 1994 and additional ROSAT time has been granted. We expect to obtain UV data on these two novae in order to consider several important problems: 1) the spectral evolution during outburst of a slow ONeMg nova; 2) the turnoff timescale and return to quiescence; 3) the masses of the white dwarfs in ONeMg systems; and 4) the effects of non-spherical ejecta on the measured abundances. IUE data will be combined with contemporaneous ground based optical, IR, and radio observations and with both KAO and ROSAT approved projects.|Y
NFFJR|The Transition to Radiative Shocks in the Cygnus Loop|John C.|Raymond|CFA|Many filaments In the Cygnus Loop show anomalously bright [O III] lines. They are presumably regions of cooling gas which have not yet reached the low temperatures where most of the Balmer line emission Is produced. Thus they are Intermediate between radiative and non-radiative shocks. IUE spectra, together with complementary optical observations (some already obtained) and some extensions of models we have developed can be used to study the role of thermal Instabilities in the post-shock gas, to study the liberation of carbon and silicon from grains, and to understand the turbulent velocities observed In the Cygnus Loop.|Y
NFGRF|UV Emission Line Study of the Elemental Abundances in the Supernova Remnant Puppis A|Robert A.|Fesen|Colorado-LASP|The southern hemisphere nebula known as Puppis A is a suspected young supernova remnant (SNR). Optically the remnant consists of short bright filamentary arcs and knots whose spectra indicate high nitrogen and oxygen enrichment, velocity dispersions of 150-200 km s^1, and radial velocities of several hundred km s^-1. X-ray observations via Einstein Observatory so suggest heavy element overabundance with the ratios of O/Fe and Ne/Fe 3 to 5 times cosmic values. These data point to a relatively young SNR probably from a Type II event which may be similar to an older CAS A.  Puppis A offers an excellent target for studying the UV emission lines from Type II remnants. While other chemical rich and likely Type II SNRs e.g. CAS A, N132D, G292 + 1.8 and the remnant in NGC 4449 have very faint emission filaments or are too highly reddened, Puppis A's filaments are relatively bright with low foreground extinction [E(B-V) 4 0.21. Because many strong and higher ionization emission lines fall in the ultraviolet spectral region (e.g. C II, C III, C IV, O III, Si III, Si IV), obtaining UV spectra of Puppis A's filaments is highly desirable.  We propose, therefore, to obtain low dispersion long and short wavelength spectra of three of Puppis A's brightest optical filaments. Our objectives are: 1) to measure relative line intensities, 2) estimate shock velocities and densities using shock model analysis, and 3) investigate the elemental abundances and variations in the chemically peculiar remnant.|Y
NGHBZ|Model of the Orion Nebula Incorporating IUE Data|Benjamin M.|Zuckerman|UCLA|We propose to use the extensive existing IUE low- and high-dispersion spectra of the UV lines observed at various positions in the Orion nebula. From discussions with several of the original experimenters, it will be important to reprocess some of these data -- particularly observations made at high dispersion. Our purpose is to utilize the nebular lines along with those in the remainder of the em spectrum to model the Orlon nebula with axisymmetric "blister" geometry code. The modeling technique is the best method for extracting fundamental physical Information from the set of observations, especially when the data have been collected from differing positions in the object, as is the case here. The space UV data set will have a strong influence on the carbon abundance determination. They will also contribute to knowledge of the geometry/density structure, electron temperature distribution, characterization of the stellar ionizing radiation field, and the other elemental abundances. Additional scope in the comparison between predicted and actual observations will be provided by the microphysics/hydrodynamics code under development. For this the high-dispersion IUE observations of the Orion nebula that exhibit line profiles will be extremely valuable.|Y
NGHMF|Carbon Abundances in Outer Galaxy HII Regions|Michel|Fich|Washington|As part of a continuing study of the outer Galaxy, we wish to measure the carbon abundances in three HII. regions, all of which are, to the best of our current knowledge, amongst the most distant from the Galactic Center.  There are radial gradients in the carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen abundances in the interstellar medium of our Galaxy as well as other systematic variations with position. Despite this, carbon does not show as good a correlation with nitrogen or oxygen as is expected. The C/N and C/O ratios may well be indicators of the evolutionary state of the stellar- system. Unfortunately, carbon is difficult to observe at any significant distance from the Sun since its optical emission lines are very weak.  In order to improve our knowledge of both the metallicity gradient in the Galaxy and of the C/N and C/O ratios in the interstellar medium it is necessary to observe UV emission lines. HII regions are particularly useful for this since they are often very bright. The HII regions. chosen for this project are both intrinsically bright and lie in "windows" of low extinction.|Y
NGHRD|H II Regions in the Magellanic Clouds & The Orion Nebulae|Reginald J.|Dufour|Rice University|We propose to study the chemical composition and physical conditions of selected small H II regions in the Magellanic Clouds and many regions in the Orion Nebula incorporating both new IUE observations and archival IUE data in conjunction with a more sophisticated theoretical model analysis treatment than found in previous studies. Some of the objectives of special interest include (a) firmly establishing the gaseous phase abundances of carbon, nitrogen, and silicon in the Magellanic Clouds; (b) investigating the characteristics and effects of dust in a few exceptionally dusty compact H II regions in the Magellanic Clouds; (c) study the effects of dust scattering on emission line strengths across the Orion Nebula utilizing IUE/optical/radio data on many positions; and (d) study spatial variations of gaseous phase abundances in the Orion Nebula, corrected for dust effects, ultimately leading to a much improved set of global abundances for this important object.|Y
NGIDV|IUE Tomography of the Rosette Nebula|Dave|Van Buren|Colorado - CASA|We propose to obtain SWP and LWR spectra of a dozen 8th magnitude O and B stars associated with the Rosette Nebula in Monoceros for the purpose of determining the structure and kinematics of this HII region / stellar wind bubble. The ability to sense along numerous lines of sight will allow us to determine the detailed physical conditions which exist in the nebula, both inside the bubble and in the HII region exterior to it. This picture can then be compared in detail to the theory of stellar wind bubbles, HII region dynamics, photodissociation fronts and shock destruction of grains.  The hot gas in the bubble has been detected in the soft x-rays by the Einstein satellite, so we anticipate a structure similar to that found by Castor, McCray and Weaver for adiabatic (non-radiative) stellar wind bubbles. Such adiabatic bubbles are ideal laboratories for the study of thermal conduction on astrophysical scales. While we will probably not be able to detect the conductive interface between the hot bubble interior and the swept up shell, we will be able to determine many properties of the bubble. These properties in turn will point to the Rosette's suitability as a cosmic laboratory for studying conductive interfaces with the Space Telescope.  The energetics and mass balance of HII regions and stellar wind bubbles is important for a number of problems: the physical conditions in and near star forming regions; the structure and evolution of "superbubbles"; and galactic "ecology".|Y

The short term objective is to measure the strengths of certain UV emission lines useful for the determination of the carbon, nitrogen, silicon, and magnesium gaseous-phase abundances in these nebulae. Success would increase three-fold the number of galactic H II regions for which the carbon abundance has been determined from the UV C III] and C II] lines (only the Orion Nebula has been successfully studied to date). Our larger and longer term objective is to combine the IUE observations with ground -based spectroscopy and imagery, and possibly with radio and IRAS observations as well, in order to study spatial variations in ionization structure, temperature, density, and dust distribution, as well as to compare the empirical data with recently developed H II region models. The Trifid Nebula is particularly suited for such study and comparison since it shows a very symmetric ionization structure.|Y

NJFAM|Low Dispersion UV Observations of the R Aquarii Jet|Andrew G.|Michalitsianos|NASA/GSFC|The symbiotic variable R Aquarii exhibits complex emission structure at a variety wavelengths. This symbiotic variable has been recently found to contain a jet, which in addition to SS 433 constitutes it as the only other known. stellar source associated with jet activity. The newly discovered optical-radio jet feature which is seen extending about 10 arcsec from the central object suggests R Aquarii is expelling material in a directional manner. Preliminary ultraviolet spectra obtained with IUE indicate the far UV spectrum of the jet feature is characterized by strong continuum which rises with decreasing wavelength over the 1200-2000A wavelength range, and which is considerably different in appearance if compared to the relatively flat continuum which arises from the central ionized nebulosity which engulfs the star system. Prominent Si III] 1892A and Si II 1808,1816A seen in the central object are virtually absent in the jet feature. Because of the prevailing low electron densities, the absence of Si III] emission in the jet possibly is explained by depletion of this particular element in ejected material. The appearance of S II 1250,1259A emission in the jet feature is consistent with the carbon line ratios which indicate the overall thermal excitation of the jet is comparatively lower than the central ionized nebula. Optical intensity emission line ratios indicate that the surrounding nebulosity is highly variable in time. We request IUE observing time in order to further investigate the temporal and spatial UV emission properties of the jet and associated optical-radio features which have recently been detected. Owing to the spatial extent of the jet feature (about 10 arcsec), R Aquarii affords us a unique opportunity to directly investigate the ionization structure and chemical composition of ejected material. Together with high spatial resolution radio maps recently obtained at 6-cm with the Very Large Array, we anticipate being able to correlate radio and UV emission in various emission features associated with R Aquarii. Our observing program, objectives and method of analysis are described in the following proposal.|Y

NJFMK|A High Resolution Study of the Jet in R Aquarii|Minas C.|Kafatos|George Mason University|As part of a collaborative NASA-ESA SERC proposal, IUE observing time is requested in order to obtain a high dispersion short wavelength UV spectrum of the newly discovered optical-radio jet feature in the symbiotic variable R Aquarii. Preliminary IUE low resolution spectra in the 1200 to 2000A wavelength range of the jet indicate the feature differs in ionization structure and ionic abundance if compared to the compact ionized nebula that surrounds the central object. Although silicon is prominently seen in the central object, the absence of Si III] 1892A and Si II 1816A emission in the Jet suggests silicon perhaps is depleted in this feature. In previous low resolution IUE spectra, the presence or absence of Si IV 1394A in the feature cannot unambiguously be determined owing to blended emission from 0 IV] 1397-1407A. If Si IV is found absent in high dispersion IUE spectra, its absence together with other ionization stages argues for an abundance depletion in material that is suspected ejected from a tidally interacting binary system. High dispersion spectra will further enable us to determine the density and temperature structure of the feature from line intensity ratios. The appearance of S II 1250,1259A emission that is tentatively identified in low dispersion IUE spectra, if confirmed in high dispersion, argues for cooler temperatures in the feature. Moreover, high spectral resolution observations of the jet will enable us to obtain the radial velocities of the UV lines. Such determination is extremely important in order to obtain information as to possible stratification in the jet as well as the overall motion of the feature from the central system. Owing to the general UV flux level evident from our low dispersion IUE observations, a total of 14 to 15 hours exposure in the short wavelength camera is required in order to detect at least the peaks of the strongest emission lines of the feature. These observations will complement low resolution IUE observations of R Aquarii that are described in another proposal being submitted separately. Accordingly, as part of a collaborative NASA-ESA SERC observing program, we propose IUE observing time to accomplish these objectives.|Y
NJGAM|Temporal Variability: UV Emission from the R Aquarii Jet|Andrew G.|Michalitsianos|NASA/GSFC|IUE observing time is requested to monitor variations in emission line strength that have been observed in the recently discovered optical/radio jet feature in the percular emission star R Aquarii. Previous IUE observations suggest a possible association between the intrinsic light output of the 387-day period Mira and the UV emission line strengths in the jet. We propose to extend our IUE cover-age in order to obtain short and long wavelength low dispersion spectra of the jet at particular phases of the Mira light cycle. As such, models that have been advanced to explain the origin of the newly discovered emission feature in R Aquarii can be tested. These IUE observations will be supplemented with high spatial resolution 6cm radio maps that will be obtained at the Very Large Array by the proposers. It is the aim of this program to develop a model for the ionization structure of both the jet feature as well as the central unresolved region, by examining in detail the differences in the UV emission line properties. Our observing program, goals and method of data analysis follow.|Y
NJGMC|Ultraviolet Spectroscopy of an Optical & Radio Jet Associated with a Young Star|Martin|Cohen|NASA-AMES Research Center|The unique optical and radio jet associated with the low-mass protostar L1551 IRS5 will be observed at both long and short ultraviolet wavelengths. It is expected that emission lines will be seen, typical of Herbig--Haro Objects, as well as an ultraviolet continuum. By observing the UV spectra from the jet, the physical conditions will be inferred enabling the first deterndnation to be made of the mass loss rate from the exciting star, So other T Tauri star, or low-mass protostar, has an associated jet that has been observed and spatially resolved by radio, infrared and optical techniques, L1551 IRS59-therefore, provides a powerful clue toward our understanding the nature of the anisotropic mass loss mechanism in these young stars.|Y
NJIMK|Temporal UV Line Emission in the R Aquarii Jet|Minas C.|Kafatos|George Mason University|X-ray emission detected for the firs', time in 1985 from the symbiotic variable R Aquarii (M7e+pec) with EXOSAT indicates this object has recently increased in excitation. Our most recent: IUE observations, which were obtained roughly about the time X-rays (in the 0.25 to 1 KeV) were seen, are consistent with EXOSAT results, since He II 1640 and particularly N V 1238,1240 emission have been increasing since 1984. He II and N V emission is localized in the spatially extended features that comprise the R Aquarii jet. As such, X-ray emission is probably confined to the jet features as well, because N V and He 11 emission are conspicuously absent in the central H II region that engulfs the hot subdwarf and Mira. Additionally, IUE data obtained over four years indicates that the absolute UV line flux in the jet is periodically variable on a timescale of ~580 days, while the general level of emission (particularly in the high excitation lines) appears to be steadily increasing. UV line and continuum emission from the central H II region appears nearly constant over the same timespan. We suspect, therefore, that the 580-day variability in the UV line flux provides important information on the photoionizing continuum from, perhaps an accretion disk, which leaves the vicinity of the system in two high energy photon beams. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a light echo has been seen in a symbiotic star. Additional IUE observations would provide important information as to whether the line intensities achieve another maximum in the summer of 1986, as we predict. IUE observing time would also enable us to investigate the UV emission properties of the jet and central H II region further, in order to determine the electron density structure, and temperature of the features that comprise the jet, during this phase of continued excitation.|Y
NJJEB|Circumstellar Emission Nebula and Jet Associated with T Tauri|Edward W.|Brugel|Colorado - CASA|There are two emission nebulae associated with the multiple star system T Tauri. Burnham's nebula, which is the only extended Herbig-Haro (HH) like emission nebula known to surround a T Tau star, covers an area ~ 65 square arcseconds south of the star. A second HH like emission knot (designated HH-1555) is located 32" west of T Tau. This nebula is connected to the stellar system through a collimated stream of high velocity gas (v ~ -150 km s^-1) seen in optical emission. These emission line nebulae are probably manifestations of the mass loss process occurring in the T Tau system.  The specific goal of this study is to investigate the affects of mass loss outflows on the gaseous material contained in the circumstellar envelope of a young star. The jet-like outflow of high velocity material apparently results in the production of shock excited gas (Burnham's nebula and HH-1555) which then radiates at ultraviolet wavelengths. Assuming that shocks actually excite the associated emission nebulae, as appears to be true for other HH-objects, then the uv line intensities may be modeled to obtain shock velocities, pre-shock densities and metal abundances. Existing shock models can be used to compare theoretical line strengths with the observed flux in the uv lines of CIV, CIII], CIII, MgII and H2. Furthermore, the optical and uv line emissions probably probe physically distinct regions of a shock cloudlet, e.g. a high-velocity bow shock and a lower velocity cloudlet shock. IUE data are required in order to "probe" the higher temperature post shock regions, which radiate primarily in the ultraviolet.  In order to investigate the following questions (and concepts), we propose to obtain SWP and LWP low dispersion spectra of the two distinct emission nebulae associated with the star T Tauri: Does a majority of the kinetic energy released by the mass loss process get dissipated in circumstellar shocks? What are the actual shock excitation parameters for these nebulae - i.e. shock velocities, gas densities and nebular masses? The emission nebulae associated with T Tauri represent a unique opportunity to study the interaction of stellar wind material with circumstellar matter. There is no other T Tau star for which the circumstellar velocity field has been determined; the total mass loss rate is known; a collimated jet has been identified terminating in a shock excited emission nebula; and the star is surround by an extended HH object. Even more unique is that the emission nebulae are bright enough to be observed with IUE. There are no ultraviolet observations of jet outflow material from a pre-main sequence star.|Y
NJJMK|Lores Observations of the R AQR Jet and Nebulosity|Minas C.|Kafatos|George Mason University|X-ray emission detected for the first time in 1985 from the symbiotic variable R Aquarii (M7e+pec) with EXOSAT indicates this object has recently increased in excitation. Our recent IUE observations are consistent with EXOSAT results, since He II 1640 and particularly N V 1238,1240 emission have been increasing since 1984. He II and N V emission is localized in the spatially extended features that comprise the R Aquarii jet. As such, X-ray emission is probably confined to the jet features as well, because N V and He II emission are conspicuously absent in the central H II region that engulfs the hot subdwarf and Mira. Additionally, IUE data obtained over four and a half years indicate that the absolute UV line flux in the jet is periodically variable on a timescale of ~580 days, while the general level of emission (particularly in the high excitation lines) appears to be steadily increasing. Recently the semi-periodic variation seems to have a shorter timescale ~ period of the Mira. UV line and continuum emission from the central H II region appears nearly constant over the same timespan. We suspect, therefore, that the semiperiodic variability in the UV line flux provides important information on the photoionizing continuum from, perhaps an accretion disk, which leaves the vicinity of the system in two high energy photon beams. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a light echo has been seen in a symbiotic star. Additional IUE observations would provide important information as to whether the line intensities are correlated with the Mira light curve. IUE observing time would also enable us to investigate the UV emission properties of the jet and central H II region further, in order to determine the electron density structure, and temperature of the features that comprise the jet, during this phase of continued excitation. Finally, we propose collaborative observations with ESA at the counterjet position (SW of the Mira) that we recently detected with our [O III] CCD observations.|Y
NLKJR|The Bow Shock Of 0623+71|John|Raymond|Smithsonian Astrophysical|Two of the major mysteries surrounding cataclysmic variables are the mass loss rates in the strong CV winds discovered by ILJE and the luminosities (and spectral shapes) of the boundary layers where an accretion disk encounters the surface of the accreting white dwarf. Krautter et al. (1987) have recently reported optical observations of a bow shock-shaped nebula associated with the nova-like variable 0621+71. This object is unreddened, and it is bright enough to detect with IUE SWP and LWP spectra will determine the nature of the nebular excitation and determine both the boundary layer luminosity and the energy flux of the wind. We also request a US2 shift to obtain observations of the P Cygni profiles of the nova-like variable itself.|Y
NLKPS|Low States of Novalike Systems|Paula|Szkody|Washington|This proposal will continue a present Target of Opportunity program that observes novalike cataclysmic variables when they enter low states. During this stage. the mass transfer from the companion virtually ceases, resulting in the domination of the UV flux by the white dwarf rather than by the disk or accretion column. Obtaining low dispersion SWP and LWP exposures during the low state enables the determination of the white dwarf temperature and gravity through comparison of the L-alpha absorption profile width and the continuum flux distribution with white dwarf models. These temperature determinations provide a direct check on theories of heating/cooling of white dwarfs in close binaries due to accretion or cyclic nova events. Results from the last two years indicate that white dwarfs in systems entering low states appear to be hotter than their normal CV counterparts. Based on numbers during the last few years. there should be ~5 low states with duration > 1 month during a given year, enabling at least 2 temperature determinations. with follow-up studios for the determination of a cooling timescale.|Y

NOKWB|Oxygen-Rich Supernova Remnants|William P.|Blair|Johns Hopkins University|We wish to obtain long, collaborative SWP and LWP large aperture spectra of two young, oxygenrich supernova remnants, one in the Large Magellanic Cloud and one in the Small Magellanic Cloud. Both objects have been observed successfully by us with IUE, and we would like to observe second positions in each object. These data will be used in conjunction with theoretical calculations to (1) derive the physical conditions of the emitting gas in each object, (2) find the abundances of carbon and silicon relative to oxygen, and (3) study spatial variations of line intensities in each object. Comparison to published models of massive evolved stars will permit us to estimate the mass of the precursor stars that created these remnants. Although both are O-rich, the two objects show differences in their optical spectra, and the UV data will provide important constraints for nucleosynthesis theories in massive stars.|Y
NOLSS|Target of Opportunity Observations of Galactic Novae in Outburst|Sumner|Starrfield|Arizona State|We propose that galactic novae brighter than about V = 6 continue to be observed as Targets of Opportunity with the IUE satellite. Ultraviolet spectrophotometry appropriately spaced in time through the nova's active period and decline will provide measurements of the shift of luminosity into the ultraviolet, absorption and emission line strengths, and may be sensitive to the early phases of dust formation in the ejecta. When combined with contemporaneous ground based optical and infrared observations, to be obtained as part of this project, the data can be used to model the outburst and, thereby, determine important physical characteristics of the nova such as the energy budget, chemical abundances of the critical CNONeMg elements, mass ejection rates, line formation mechanisms, and dust condensation processes. If we are fortunate to have a very bright nova outburst during the 12th year, then it will be possible to follow it to minimum and obtain more UV data on what causes a nova to end its active phase. The ongoing surveys of the LMC have discovered two bright novae in this galaxy during the 10th and 11th IUE episodes and we can expect further discoveries during the 12th. The two novae in the LMC are exhibiting different outburst characteristics, both in the optical and UV, and data on more LMC novae are desired. We emphasize that continuing studies of the LMC Novae are providing important data on the UV behavior of novae in one external galaxy.  This is a companion proposal to one in which we request time to continue observations of Nova QU Vul 1984, GQ Mus 1983, and the two 1988 LMC Novae.|Y
NOMSB|A Search for Orbital Modulation in Quiescent Dwarf Novae|C. Stuart|Bowyer|Berkeley|We have discovered a modulation in the UV continuum of the dwarf nova SU UMa, which is close to be orbital period. Ibis modulation has hiterto remained unrecognised, due to the short integrations needed to observe it. Furthermore, we have no convincing explanation of this effect. We are therefore proposing to re-observe SU UMa at a much higher time resolution than we used in our discovery observations, in order to determine the shape of the modulation, and discover how repeatable the light curve is. In addition we wish to observe two other SU UMa systems in order to discover how widespread this phenomenon is.|Y
NOMSS|Target of Opportunity Observations of Classical and Recurrent Novae|Sumner G.|Starrfield|Arizona|We propose that, over the next two years, classical or recurrent novae brighter than about V = 8, or new novae discovered in the LMC, continue to be observed as Targets of Opportunity with the IUE satellite. UV spectra appropriately spaced in time through the nova's active period and decline provide measurements of the shift of luminosity into the UV, absorption and emission line strengths, the kinematics of the ejection, and are sensitive to dust formation in the ejecta. When combined with contemporaneous ground based optical and IR observations, to be obtained as part of this project but not funded by IUE, the data can be used to model the outburst and, thereby, determine important physical characteristics of novae such as the energy budget, chemical abundances of the critical CNONeMg elements, mass ejection rates, line formation mechanisms, and dust condensation processes. For those novae with extensive circumstellar material at outburst, it then becomes possible to study the interaction of the ejecta with its environment. If we are fortunate to have a very bright nova outburst during the 13th year, then it will be possible to follow it to minimum and obtain additional UV data on the turn-off phase of the outburst. The ongoing surveys of the LMC discovered two bright novae during the 10th and 11th IUE episodes and we hope for further discoveries during the 13th. The two novae in the LMC exhibited different outburst characteristics, both in the optical and UV, and data on more LMC novae are required.

NONSS|Target of Opportunity Observations of Galactic Novae in Outburst|Sumner G.|Starrfield|Arizona State University|We propose to continue to observe Galactic and Magellanic Cloud classical or recurrent novae in outburst over the next two years with IUE. Any Galactic nova brighter than about V = 8, or LMC or SMC nova brighter than about V = 12 will be considered as Targets of Opportunity for this proposal. UV spectra appropriately spaced in time through the nova's active period and decline provide measurements of the shift of luminosity into the UV, absorption and emission line strengths, the kinematics of the ejection, and are sensitive to dust formation in the ejecta. The UV data will be combined with contemporaneous ground based optical, IR, and radio observations, to be obtained as part of this project but not funded by IUE. These data are necessary to model the outburst and to determine important physical characteristics of novae such as the energy budget, chemical abundances of the critical CNONeMg elements, mass ejection rates, line formation mechanisms, and dust condensation processes. Because most of the energy radiated by a nova during its outburst is in the UV and EUV and because there are emission lines in the UV from ions that do not radiate in the optical, the IUE is absolutely necessary for the study of the outburst. Surveys of the LMC have discovered four bright novae and UV studies of these novae are providing important data on the UV behavior of novae in our galaxy and the LMC.|Y

NOPSS|Coordinated Multiwavelength Observations of Classical and Recurrent Novae in Outburst|Sumner G.|Starrfield|Arizona State University|We propose to continue observing Galactic and Magellanic Cloud classical or recurrent novae in outburst over the next three years with IUE. Any Galactic nova brighter than about V ~ 8, or LMC or SMC nova brighter than V ~ 12 will be considered as a Target of Opportunity for this proposal. We will concentrate on obtaining as complete coverage as possible of the early (pre-UV maximum) spectral development and observe less frequently as the nova evolves into the nebular stage. We place special emphasis on Magellanic Cloud novae since they also serve as calibrators of absolute properties of the outbursts. UV spectra, appropriately spaced in time through the nova's active period and decline, provide measurements of the formation and lifting of the iron curtain, the shift of the peak of the emitted radiation into the UV, the absorption and emission line strengths, the kinematics of the ejecta, and are sensitive to dust formation. The UV data will be combined with contemporaneous ground based optical, IR, X-ray, and radio observations, to be obtained as part of this project. However, because most of the energy radiated by a nova during its outburst is in the UV and EUV and because there are emission lines in the UV from ions that do not radiate in the optical, the IUE is absolutely necessary for the study of the outburst.|Y
NOQSS|Multiwavelength Observations of Novae During the Late Stages of Their Outbursts|Sumner|Starrfield|Arizona State University|We propose to continue observations of five post-explosion phase novae that are still bright enough to study with the IUE Satellite and at least two of them are probably still in outburst. Two (GQ Mus and RS Oph) were observed by ROSAT as part of our multiwavelength programs. We are requesting observing time for novae in order to obtain UV data on 5 important problems: 1) the turnoff timescale and return to quiescence; 2) the long term evolution between outbursts; 3) the ultraviolet spectra of magnetic novae; 4) the masses of the white dwarfs in nova systems; and 5) the inter-outburst evolution of one recurrent nova. We have obtained UV, optical, and X-ray data on GQ Mus since March 1983. No other nova has been continuously studied in the UV for as long as GQ Mus and it is providing unique data on the evolution to turnoff. We are also proposing to obtain IUE data for V842 Cen which was a dust-forming nova in order to study the late stages of this class. In this study, IUE data will be combined with contemporaneous ground based optical and IR observations.|Y
NORPS|Monitoring the Long-Term Changes in NLS|Paula|Szkody|U Washington|The Indiana Automated CCD Photometric Telescope has been monitoring CVs for the last 4 yrs. During this time, it has become evident that several novalike systems undergo peculiar periodic variations of several magnitudes, which appear very different from "normal" novalike activity. During the past year, we began a coordinated IUE and optical study of 2 systems in order to gain a better understanding of the unique accretion behavior in novalikes as compared to dwarf novae. Preliminary results on these have shown dramatic changes in the UV fluxes. Continuation of this program will allow us to explore the accretion parameters within this group.|Y
NORSS|Multiwavelength Observations of Nova Cygni 1992 and Nova Cas 1993 - Late Stages of Outburst|Sumner G.|Starrfield|Arizona State University|We propose to continue existing IUE programs to observe a slow ONeMg nova and a slow CO that are still bright enough to study with the IUE Satellite. Nova Cyg 1992 is the brightest nova to be observed since Nova V1500 Cygni 1975 and we have followed it since discovery. It is relatively nearby (~3 kpc) with small reddening (E(B-V) ~ 0.3). Nova Cas 1993 has been observed by IUE since shortly after discovery. It is a CO nova that formed an optically thick dust shell. Both of these novae have been observed with IUE utilizing our Target of Opportunity proposal and we can accurately determine the exposure time for each camera. Nova Cyg 1992 has also been observed by HST(GHRS and FOC), ROSAT, VOYAGER, GRO, KAO, and EUVE. We have an approved EUVE proposal and will observe it with EUVE in June 1994. We propose to continue to obtain UV data on these two novae in order to consider several important problems: 1) the spectral evolution during outburst of a slow ONeMg nova and a slow CO nova; 2) the turnoff timescale and return to quiescence; 3) the masses of the white dwarfs; and 4) the effects of non-spherical ejecta on the measured abundances.

Spectrograms in both the short and the long wavelength ranges are required in order to cover the entire spectral range between 1150A and 3200A.. Exposure times ranging from ~10 minutes to ~2 hours are required for the low resolution spectrograms. These exposures will be used primarily to establish which emission lines are present, to determine the relative intensities of the lines and their absolute intensities, and to evaluate the feasibility of exposing at high resolution in order to resolve the astrophysically significant doublets. Typical exposure times of 1 to 4 hours are estimated to be required for the high resolution spectrograms in those cases where they are warranted. Certain emission line ratios yield electron densities, others yield excitation conditions, others contribute to the determination of electron temperatures, and still others yield information about the interstellar excitation in the ultraviolet which is needed for the proper interpretation of the other data. The strength of the broad absorption feature near 2200A also yields information about interstellar extinction when it is observable in the ultraviolet continuum of the central stars, as has been demonstrated by observations of the central stars of planetary nebulae with the ANS.|Y
NPBCP|Ultraviolet Observations of Very Young Planetary Nebulae|C. R.|Purton|York University|We wish to examine a small number of objects which are believed to be very young planetary nebulae. They are characterised by a radio spectrum of the unusual type S ~ nu which indicates their youth, and by an optical and infrared spectrum similar to that of the more evolved planetary nebulae. Ultraviolet data are required in order to establish the mass loss rate associated with the objects, and to determine the nature of the central star. These features are closely related to the general problem of the formation and evolution of planetary nebulae.|Y
NPBJL|Observations of Planetary Nebula Shells and Central Stars|Julie|Lutz|Washington State University|This is a proposal to do satellite-ultraviolet observations of planetary nebula shells and central stars. The observations of emission lines from nebular shells will be used to determine the physical parameters (such as electron temperature and density) and the ionization structure of the nebulae. The observations of central stars will be concerned with temperature determination, mass loss, and comparison of the central stars with Population I hot stars.|Y
NPBLA|Ultraviolet Observations of High Excitation Planetaries|Lawrence H.|Aller|UCLA|The primary purpose of this investigation is to measure line intensities in high excitation planetaries which have been extensively observed in the ordinary visual region. Emphasis is to be placed on nebular type transitions of [NeIV] and the auroral line of [NeV] to derive the electron density and temperature in strongly ionised inner regions of planetaries. Supporting data from lines of CIII, CIV, OIII, NIII, HeII will then aid in the refinement of model calculations and determination of elemental abundances.|Y

NPBTB|UV Spectrophotometry of Planetary Nebulae|Timothy|Barker|Wheaton College|I propose to use the IUE to work on four projects related to planetary nebulae.  First, I would study the ionization structure of Ne in NGC 6720 by measuring the strength of the [Ne IV] lines at 2440 A in several regions. This study might resolve the discrepancies in the Ne abundances found from observations at visual wavelengths and enable improvement of theoretical models and abundance measurements of Ne in emission nebulae.  Second, I would measure the [Ne IV] line intensities in several planetaries in addition to NGC 6720. A comparison with the intensities of visual [Ne IV] transitions would permit the first reliable determination of the electron temperature in high-ionization regions of planetaries. The ratio of the UV line intensities is sensitive to electron density; the calibration of this relationship could be checked by comparison with other density measurements for these objects.  The [Ne IV] density indicator could then be used to measure the densities of several planetaries in the Magellanic Clouds. Since the distance to these planetaries is known, the masses of the planetaries could be found. This would provide a check on the constant-mass assumption used in the standard distance scale for planetaries and provide an important independent check on the calibration of the distance scale.  Finally, I propose to observe the UV C III] and C IV line intensities in several planetaries which have unusually large He abundances to see if the reported C excess in planetaries is likely to be due to mixing of nuclear-processed material into the planetary envelope before it is ejected.|Y
NPCAB|Observations of Planetary Nebulae|Albert|Boggess|NASA/GSFC|The scientific objective of the proposed observing program is to use the IUE for obtaining high dispersion ultraviolet spectrograms of planetary nebulae in order to study their physical conditions, excitation processes, degree of excitation, stages of ionization, structure, and chemical abundances. Spectrograms in both the short and the long wavelength ranges are required in order to cover the entire spectral range between 120OA and 3200A. Emphasis will be placed on high excitation planetaries where high dispersion is particularly required to resolve some of the more important emission features. The data will be used to make spectrophotometric measurements of emission line fluxes and to measure astrophysically interesting line ratios. Certain emission line ratios yield electron densities, others yield excitation conditions, others contribute to the determination of electron temperatures, and still others yield information about the interstellar extinction in the ultraviolet which is needed for the proper interpretation of the other data. These data will be used in conjunction with existing low dispersion IUE spectra to provide information on the high temperature regions of planetaries that cannot be studied using only emission lines of visible wavelengths.|Y
NPCJL|Observations of Peculiar Central Stars of Planetary Nebulae with IUE|Julie H.|Lutz|Washington State University|Peculiar central stars are objects which have absorption spectra characteristic of MK spectral classes A to K in combination with emission lines which are characteristic of planetary nebulae. Several Atype peculiar central stars are known (e.g. NGC 1514, NGC 3132) and have been studied with IUE.  I am proposing to observe four peculiar central stars which have G- or Ktype optical absorption spectra and medium-to-high excitation emission lines. The names of these objects are Cn 1-1, M 1-2 (VV8), BD + 67 922 and T 53. The data from IUE will be used in combination with optical data (from my observing programs and collaborative observing programs) to derive temperatures, densities and abundances in the regions where the emission lines arise. The determination of the physical conditions in these objects is complicated by the fact that three of the four targets show some variability in the emission lines.  More than one observing session is necessary for the variable objects. I am proposing two observing runs scheduled several months apart. I have already observed Cn 1-1 and BD + 67 922 in September 1979, thus I would have coverage at three different epochs on these two objects. The proposed observations should be obtained at dates suggested by the optical variability. In combination with the past and continuing optical observations, the ultraviolet data should contribute greatly to interpreting the behavior of these peculiar objects.|Y
NPCLA|Ultraviolet Observations of High Excitation Planetary Nebulae|Lawrence H.|Aller|UCLA|The far ultraviolet region of high excitation planetaries contains a wealth of ionic lines, including those of HeI, HeII, CII, CIII, CIV, NIII, DAT, OIV, OV, [NeIV], SiIII, and SiIV which enable us to better assess the interstellar extinction, to determine electron density and temperature in the highly excited and strongly ionised regions of these objects, and to determine their chemical compositions. We hope to accomplish this objective by securing the necessary ultraviolet data and combining them with extensive relevant visual measurements. For example, intensities of the nebular type transitions, 2423 of [NeIV] combined with intensities of the auroral type transitions near X4725 can yield accurate electron temperatures in the emitting region. In the present proposal, which is based on experience gained in our May 1979 observing run, we would like to observe fainter lines, exploit possibilities offered by higher resolution, and examine two or three additional objects. As far as possible, the data are to be interpreted with the aid of theoretical models.|Y
NPDJH|Dust in Planetary Nebulae|J. Patrick|Harrington|Maryland|We propose to obtain long exposures of the planetary nebulae NGC 2440 and IC 2165 in order to measure the fluxes in certain faint lines of great diagnostic value. The most important of these is C III 2297 A. This line arises by dielectronic recombination of C^+3 ions, and, hence, provides a direct measure the ionic abundance. By comparison with the collisionally excited C IV 1549 doublet - which also depends upon the C^+3 ionic abundance - we can directly measure the attenuation of this C IV resonance line by internal dust.  With regard to the analysis of the data obtained, the principal investigator has already constructed computer models of these nebulae based on earlier IUE observations. These models do not include the effects of the attenuation of resonance lines by dust. The proposed observations will enable the construction of revised models which will: (a) provide improved values of the carbon abundances of the nebulae, and (b) provide quantitative information on the optical depth due to internal dust at ultraviolet wavelengths. This latter information, when combined with existing infrared observations, should allow us to constrain the size and composition of the dust grains within these objects.|Y
NPDJK|Central Stars of Large Planetary Nebulae|James B.|Kaler|Illinois|We propose to observe Central stars of the class of large planetary nebulae, which are predicted to be developed by stars of high mass. We will measure the fluxes at short wavelengths. Comparison with optical fluxes will allow the evaluation of the optically derived Zanstra temperatures, which will include an examination of the role of circumstellar dust. The ultraviolet observations are critical for the correct placement of the stars on the log L log T plane, and thus for the detailed examination of the evolution of planetary nuclei.|Y
NPDLA|Stratification Effects and Diagnostics for Planetart Nebulae|Lawrence H.|Aller|California|The extension of spectroscopic observations of planetary nebulae in the far ultraviolet together with the availability of extensive ground-based spectroscopic data (reaching to rather faint lines), permits improved nebular diagnostics, better estimates of chemical compositions, and of interstellar extinction. Most of these studies have dealt with integrated nebular light. Options offered by the IUE permit investigations of stratification effects and of structural details at least for the stronger and more easily observed emissions, e.g. those of CIII and [NeIV]. In particular, UV lines would enable us to probe the inner, higher excitation regions of planetaries and evaluate the reliability of theoretical models on which we depend for chemical composition determinations.|Y
NPDSM|The Carbon Abundance in High-Excitation Planetary Nebulae in the Magellanic Clouds|Stephen P.|Maran|NASA/GSFC|We propose to determine the carbon abundance in planetary nebulae (PN) in the Magellanic Clouds. This information is needed as it must reflect the degree to which processed material in the progenitor stars is mixed into the envelopes ejected to form the PN. The PN for this study are selected for high excitation, very low or undetectable reddening, and availability of calibrated visible emission line fluxes.  Precise positions are available and photoionization models exist or are being prepared from the ground-based data. Since the UV carbon lines have a major role in the thermal balance of the nebulae, models can be revised to yield improved accuracy in the 0 and N abundances as well as giving the carbon abundance. Scaling from galactic PN observed with IUE indicates that a useful spectrum may be obtained in a single U.S. I shift with the low dispersion, short wavelength spectrograph. PN are major contributors of metals to the ISM of the Clouds and it is known that H II regions in the clouds are C,N,O deficient; it is important to compare abundances in the two kinds of nebulae. The He abundance should also be found from this work.|Y
NPDTB|The Ionization Abundance of C, N, & NE in Planetary Nebulae|Timothy|Barker|Wheaton College|I am proposing to measure UV line intensities in the planetary nebula NGC 7009 in four positions where I have made optical observations. I wish to study the ionization of C, N, and Ne so that I can make more reliable estimates of the abundances of these elements in other planetaries which I have observed optically. The ultimate goal is to distinguish between the "contamination" of nebular material (by elements synthesized in the progenitor star) and the original material in the galaxy at the time the progenitor formed. I also propose to get more insight into this problem by observing the C abundance in a halo planetary nebula which previous IUE observations indicated was extraordinarily high.|Y
NPDWF|Observations of Variable & Evolving Planetary or Proto-Planetary Nebulae|Walter A.|Feibelman|NASA/GSFC|The scientific objective of the proposed observing program is to use the IUE for obtaining ultraviolet spectrograms of variable and evolving planetary or proto-planetary nebulae in order to study their changes in emission line and continuum characteristics as a function of time. These changes include degree of excitation, stages of ionization, and structural modifications. Spectrograms in both the start and long wavelength region between 1150 and 3200 are required,., with exposure times ranging from about 20 minutes to 3 hours duration. Experience during the first three years of observations with the ME has shown that profound changes have taken place in such objects as, for example, HM Sagittae in the level of ionization and gradual emergence of lines of increasing excitation, as well as the near -disappearance of certain Wolf-Rayet emission features. These changes offer a rare opportunity to follow the evolutionary pattern for this type of object. UV observations are required to correlate electron densities and temperatures with near- simultaneous ground based observations.|Y
NPEGF|Carbon in Planetary Nebulae|Gary J.|Ferland|Kentucky|We propose to observe several emission lines in bright planetary nebulae to fully develop a new method of determining electron temperatures and carbon abundances in gaseous nebulae. A method which enables an accurate determination of the electron temperature in the C^+2  zone of a nebula and hence a reliable measurement of the C^+2/H+ ionic abundance ratio is outlined. Uncertainties in both line fluxes and interstellar reddening are shown to have a very slight effect on the deduced abundance. A preliminary analysis based on our method and employing published data is performed and we show that a nearly order of magnitude discrepancy exists between this method and optical observations of recombination lines. We propose to observe planetary nebulae with a wide range of ionization and to compare these data with predictions of model nebulae to determine the source of this discrepancy and enable reliable carbon abundances to be determined.|Y
NPEJH|A Study of the Planetary Nebula IC 2149|J. Patrick|Harrington|U Maryland|We propose to study the important planetary nebula IC 2149 by constructing ionization models for comparison with the IUE and optical observations. Because of the bright central star and small angular size of this nebula, low dispersion IUE spectra will saturate in the continuum before the nebular lines are well exposed. We will therefore obtain long (~7 hr) high-dispersion spectra to increase the line to continuum contrast. Such spectra will also enable us to separate the important nebular C IV 1549 emission doublet from the broad stellar P-Cygni feature.  The observed continuum will be compared to stellar model atmosphere fluxes to examine critically Gurzadyan's claim of strong 2-photon nebular continuum emission.|Y
NPEJK|Central Stars of Large Planetary Nebulae|James B.|Kaler|Illinois|We propose to observe the central stars of the class of large planetary nebulae. The energy distribution in the ultraviolet, and comparison with optical fluxes, will allow the evaluation and calibration of optically derived Zanstra temperatures, including an examination of the role played by circumstellar dust. The ultraviolet observations of as wide a variety of nebular and stellar types as possible are critical for the correct placement of stars on the log L - log T plane, and thus for the detailed examination of the evolution of planetary nuclei. Observation of line features will allow further study of conditions in the stellar atmospheres including current massloss rates. Emphasis will he placed on the short-wave ultraviolet, with selected objects being observed in the long-wave uv.|Y
NPELA|Stratification in & Chemical Compositions of Planetary Nebulae|Lawrence H.|Aller|CAL LA|Determinations of chemical abundances in planetary nebulae require measurements of lines in the far ultraviolet, particularly for important elements such as C and N that play crucial roles in nuclear processes in their progenitor stars. These elements show large composition fluctuations from one object to another. To handle this problem properly, we should measure not only the integrated nebular light but also structural details - at least in more easily observed radiations, e.g. those of CIV and [NeIV]. The UV emissions also permit one to probe the inner more highly ionized cores of planetaries and assess validity of theoretical models intended for chemical composition determinations. Options offered by the IUE allow such studies of stratification effects.|Y
NPETB|The Ionization Structure of Planetary Nebulae|Timothy|Barker|Wheaton College|I am proposing to continue studying the ionization structure of planetary nebulae by making detailed optical and UV measurements in different positions in three carefully-selected nebulae. The objectives are to learn more about the physical processes in nebulae so that reliable abundance estimates can be made in the much larger number of planetaries that I am observing optically. The ultimate goals are to distinguish between the "contamination" of nebular material (by elements synthesized in the progenitor star) and the original material in the galaxy at the time the progenitor formed, and so to learn more both about stellar evolution and the history of galactic nucleosynthesis.|Y
NPEWF|Observations of Variable & Proto-Planrtary Nebulae|Walter A.|Feibelman|NASA/GSFC|The scientific objective of the proposed observing program is to use the IUE for obtaining ultraviolet spectra of variable and proto-planetary nebulae that have in the past shown dramatic changes in their ultraviolet characteristics. In particular, the so-called "proto-planetary" nebulae V 1016 Cyg, HM Sge and HBV 475 (=V 1329 Cyg) were studied during the forth year and revealed changes in emission line fluxes, line profiles, emission line ratios, electron densities and level of excitation and ionization. These changes offer a rare opportunity to follow the evolutionary pattern for this type of object. Longer term changes in emission line fluxes and profiles are suspected for IC 4997 and NGC 6905. A high dispersion spectrogram is required for NGC 6905 in the LWR range to resolve some ambiguities not resolved in the previous low dispersion observations.|Y
NPFHB|Ultraviolet Observations of Close-Binary and Pulsating Nuclei of Planetary Nebulae|Howard E.|Bond|Louisiana State|In the past few years, the writer and co-workers have found the central stars of four planetary nebulae to be extremely close binaries (orbital periods of 2.7 to 16 hours). We propose to obtain low-dispersion IUE spectra of these objects in order to determine temperatures, distances, and other parameters of these important binary systems.  Recently, the very hot central star of the Planetary nebula Kohoutek 1-16 was found to be a pulsating variable with a period near 27 minutes. This object, along with the pulsating hot white dwarf PG 1159-035 and two further pulsating PG white dwarfs we have recently discovered, defines a new instability strip at the left edge of the HR diagram. We propose to obtain ultraviolet spectra of the central star of K 1-16 in order to provide information on its chemical composition and location in the HR diagram.  It is also proposed to obtain IUE spectra of 0623+71, a new l2th-mag cataclysmic variable surrounded by faint nebulosity.|Y
NPFHW|Investigation of Neutral Circumnebular Material in Planetary Nebulae|H. Alwyn|Wootten|NRAO|Recent far infrared and radio observations have revealed the presence of massive dense neutral atomic and molecular components in the shells of young planetary nebulae and their supposed progenitors. The total mass contained in these components appears to exceed that of the ionized component of planetary nebulae by an order of magnitude, therefore constituting the majority of the mass shed during the evolution of the central star. The chemistry of this shell can be described as photochemical alteration of a pre-existing circumstellar molecular shell. The composition of such a shell can be expected to favor neutral and singly ionized heavy atoms, copious amounts of molecular hydrogen, and some heavy molecules. The UV resonance lines of C I have been detected in absorption against the central stars in several planetaries and constitute a singularly powerful probe of the ionization, temperature and density structure in the shell. We propose to investigate these multiplets at high resolution to decipher their velocity structure, and to determine line of sight C I column densities for comparison to far infrared and radio observations. If the density were high enough, absorption arising from the finestructure levels of the C I multiplets might also be seen. The relative populations of the fine-structure levels constrains the density and temperature within the neutral shells surrounding planetaries. The results of this study will clarify the interpretation of these latter lines, and sharpen our understanding of chemical processes in circumstellar shells.|Y
NPFJK|Central Stars of Large Planetary Nebulae|James B.|Kaler|Illinois|We propose to continue our observations of the central stars of large planetary nebulae through four specific programs designed first to examine the character and evolution of these stars, and second to study the general evolution of planetary nebulae as their cores proceed toward the white dwarf state. First, we wish to obtain high-dispersion spectra of the unique nucleus of Abell 78, which has ejected knots of nearly pure helium into the surrounding nebula in the recent past. Second, we need to examine further some previously observed stars in order to complete and improve data sets. Third, we plan to extend our current low dispersion survey to nuclei of newly discovered nebulae, to search for stars with unusual winds, and to improve our sample of temperature distributions. Finally, we will examine a pair of unusually bright stars that may be binary companions of the true nuclei, in order that we may increase the number of known systems wherein the properties of the companion can be used to assess critical nebular parameters such as distance and mass.|Y
NPFLA|Structure of and Abundances in High-Excitation Planetaries|Lawrence H.|Aller|UCLA|Planetary nebulae are associated with the penultimate stages of the life of a star, and a determination of their chemical compositions is of particular interest in assessing stellar evolutionary scenarios. Of the elements that play crucial roles during these advanced stages in the life of a giant star, two of the most important are carbon and nitrogen. The abundance of carbon, and, in the more interesting and highly excited objects, that of nitrogen, can be found reliably only with the aid of UV lines. Furthermore, options offered by the IUE permit stratification effect studies, since we can measure variations in emissions of C III] and [Ne IV], for example, across nebular images. Thus, we can better assess the validity of theoretical models on which we depend for studies of chemical compositions.|Y
NPFST|High Dispersion UV Spectroscopy of the Planetary Nebula NGC 3918|Silvia|Torres-Peimbert|Mexico|NGC 3918 is one of the brightest PN in the sky. Carefully studied it might be the best PN to construct a very detailed model because it has a very homogeneous density distribution.  Pena and Torres-Peimbert (1983) from an IUE high dispersion exposure of 120^m found that the resonance lines intensity ratio of NV 1239/1242 is equal to 1.2  0.1 while that of CIV is normal (1.9  0.2). This result should be verified, because if true, it implies that there is absorption by intervening hot gas of large N(NV)/N(ClV) column density ratio. This gas could be part of the general low density interstellar medium or could be in the form of a very extended envelope, perhaps produced by the first stage of mass loss from the progenitor star.  We would like to secure more high dispersion IUE spectra of this planetary nebula to further investigate these problems.|Y
NPFTB|The Ionization Structure of Planetary Nebulae|Timothy|Barker|Wheaton University|I am proposing to continue my study of the ionization structure of planetary nebulae by making detailed optical and UV measurements in different positions in four carefully-selected nebulae. The objectives are to learn more about the physical processes in nebulae so that reliable abundance estimates can be made in the much larger number of planetaries that I am observing optically. The ultimate goals are to distinguish between the "contamination" of nebular material (by elements synthesized in the progenitor star) and the original material in the galaxy at the time the progenitor formed, and so to learn more both about stellar evolution and the history of galactic nucleosynthesis.|Y
NPFWF|Observations of the Bipolar Planetary Nebula NGC 2346|Walter A.|Feibelman|NASA/GSFC|The scientific objectives of this IUE observing program are to obtain SWP spectrograms in both low and high resolution under "quiet" (US1 shift) conditions. Although preliminary results were obtained in the 5th episode, only low dispersion spectrograms were taken and most of them were adversely affected by radiation background noise. NGC 2346 appears to be a unique and extremely peculiar object: Its nucleus somehow began showing eclipses in 1982 that were totally absent between 1974-1981. A 16 day orbital period derived from IUE data agrees with the single-lined spectroscopic radial velocity period. Asymmetric emission line profiles in the UV suggest gas streams, possibly an accretion disk, and other peculiar features that are variable as a function of phase. A dust cloud or cold third body may be involved in the system.|Y
NPGHB|Ultraviolet Observations of Close-Binary and Pulsating Nuclei of Planetary Nebulae|Howard E.|Bond|Louisiana State|Over the past few years, the writer and co-workers have carried out a program of ground-based photometric monitoring of central stars of planetary nebulae. To date, this survey has resulted in the discoveries of four extremely close binaries and a short-period pulsating central star. This proposal requests IUE time to continue a program of ultraviolet observations of these interesting new objects.  The newly discovered close-binary nuclei have orbital periods of 2.7 to 16 hours. We propose to obtain low-dispersion IUE spectra of these objects in order to provide information on the temperatures, distances, and other parameters of these important binary systems.  We have found the very hot central star of Kohoutek 1-16 to be a pulsating variable with a period of 28 minutes. Along with the pulsating hot white dwarf PG 1159-035 and two further pulsating PG white dwarfs that we have recently discovered, these objects define a new instability strip at the left-hand edge of the HR diagram. We propose to obtain ultraviolet spectra of the central star of K 1-16, along with simultaneous ground-based photometry, in order to provide information on its pulsational characteristics.|Y
NPGJH|Effects of Stellar Winds on Planetary Nebulae|J. Patrick|Harrington|Maryland|A single IUE spectrum obtained early this year of one of the knots near the central star of the planetary nebula Abell 30 revealed the presence of heating not attributable to photoionization. The likely cause of this heating is the impact of the star's 4000 km s^-1 stellar wind. Thus observations of this planetary bear directly on the important astrophysical problem of the cooling of hot shocked gas (T >10^8 K) in contact with a cooler (T ~ 10^4 K) component. We wish to make further observations of this nebula and of another which might show similar effects.|Y
NPGJL|IUE Studies of Infrared D-Type Symbiotic Stars/Planetary Nebulae|Julie H.|Lutz|Washington State University|This is a proposal to obtain low resolution IUE observations of some objects which have been classified both as infrared D-type symbiotic stars and as planetary nebulae. Optical fluxes over the wavelength range 3200 to 8000 A will also be obtained. Electron temperatures and densities will be derived from diagnostic emission line ratios, all of which require both optical and ultraviolet line fluxes. Abundances of He, C, N, 0 and Ne will be derived. The ultraviolet lines are essential for this analysis, particularly for C, N and Ne. Other parameters such as hot star temperatures and distances (from optical data) will be derived. The data will be used to ascertain the evolutionary state of these objects and to learn more about compact and/or binary planetary nebulae and unusual symbiotic stars.|Y
NPGLA|'Chemical Compositions, Physical & Structure of High-       Excitation Planetary Nebulae'|Lawrence|Aller|University of California|Our main objective is the determination of chemical compositions of planetary nebulae, since these data are of critical importance to evaluation of stellar evolutionary scenarios. Planetaries are associated with the penultimate stage of a star's life. The abundances of carbon and nitrogen are particularly significant. They can be found reliably only with the aid of UV lines. The IUE data permit the nebular ionization stratification to be assessed because we can find the distribution of the emissions in [Ne IV], and in ionic radiations of nitrogen, carbon, and oxygen across the nebular images. With such data we can improve our calculated theoretical models intended for the interpretation of nebular chemical compositions.|Y
NPGSM|Planetary Nebulae & Their Central Stars in the Magellanic Clouds|Stephen P.|Maran|NASA/GSFC|We will investigate LMC and SMC planetaries, to determine chemical abundances, especially for carbon, and to determine the central star luminosities and temperatures. Both objectives will provide significant information to confront theories of the evolution of planetary nebula precursor stars. The proposed targets include both Nrich and C-rich planetaries. In previous IUE programs, we observed and analyzed seven planetaries in the Clouds; a comparable number of other Cloud planetaries has been observed by a group in the UK. Recent experience (our IUE 6th Year results) suggests that a substantial sample of the planetaries in the Clouds, with differing ionization conditions, chemical compositions, and central star luminosities from those already observed are within reach of IUE, and such observations are here proposed. Combining the earlier results with the proposed work, it should be possible to characterize the properties of a significant number of planetaries and their central stars, all of known distances. In particular, the central stars can be plotted in the HR diagram, and their masses estimated from theory as done in our previous work. Thus, the usual assumptions in statistical studies. that optically thin planetaries have equal mass and that optically thick planetaries have equal luminosity in a standard line, can be avoided. Supporting visible-light spectral data are available for all of the proposed targets.|Y
NPGTB|The Ionization Structure of Planetary Nebulae|Timothy|Barker|Wheaton College|I am proposing to continue my study of the ionization structure of planetary nebulae by making detailed optical and UV measurements in five different positions in two carefully-selected nebulae. The objectives are to learn more about the physical processes in nebulae so that reliable abundance estimates can be made in the much larger number of planetaries that I am observing optically. The ultimate goals are to distinguish between the "contamination" of nebular material (by elements synthesized in the progenitor star) and the original material in the galaxy at the time the progenitor formed, and so to learn more both about stellar evolution and the history of galactic nucleosynthesis.|Y
NPGWF|Observations of Bipolar and/or Protoplanetary Nebulae|Walter A.|Feibelman|NASA/GSFC|The scientific objectives of this proposed observing program are to obtain ultraviolet spectrograms of bipolar and protoplanetary nebulae that are believed to toe young and possibly rapidly evolving planetary nebulae. Most of the objects on this program have never been observed by IUE, but two (HM Sge and V1016 Cyg) are known to be variable and have shown dramatic changes in their optical as well UV characteristics. Continued monitoring of these and related objects offers a rare opportunity to follow astrophysically important evolutionary patterns for a class of objects believed to be progenitors of planetary nebulae. Low dispersion spectra are needed to determine emission line fluxes, central star temperatures, and extinction parameters. If P Cygni profiles are present, they can. be used to estimate stellar winds and terminal velocities.|Y
NPHSM|Completion of Survey of Planetaries in the Magellanic Clouds|Stephen P.|Maran|NASA/GSFC|We propose to complete our survey of the ultraviolet spectra of planetary nebulae in the Magellanic Clouds with the observation of 3 additional nebulae in the SMC and 5 in the LMC. Counting the planetary in the Fornax galaxy, this will bring the total number studied by us to 21 nebulae in external galaxies of known distance in the Local Group, enough nebulae to make meaningful comparison of observational data on abundance ratios, nebular masses, and central star masses with the predictions of stellar evolution theory. The nebular masses come directly from the models that we (Aller) prepare in the course of our abundance determinations, which use the IUE data (which are crucial for carbon) and groundbased spectrometry; because the nebulae are at known distances, the masses can be reliably determined, subject to filling-factor uncertainties that can be reduced at a future time, after the nebulae (typical diameters 0.5 - 1 are see) are imaged with the Space Telescope. The central star masses will be estimated from luminosities and temperatures to be determined by one of us (Ford) in his program of guaranteed-time observations and (hopefully, subsequent competitive time observations) with the Space Telescope. The present targets were not proposed by us in previous years because we did not have suitable visible-light spectrometry for them, but Ford and M. Dopita are now completing a program of echelle spectroscopy of planetaries within the top three magnitudes of the population in each of the Clouds, which will provide the necessary data on the visiblewavelength lines in our targets. The IUE + groundbased results provide abundances and nebular masses; the future ST data will yield accurate stellar data. All can be compared meaningfully with recent calculations of evolution on the asymptotic giant branch.|Y
NPHWF|Emission Line Ratios in Planetary Nebulae and Related Objects|Walter|Feibelman|NASA/GSFC|The scientific objectives of this proposed archival program is to study emission line ratios of planetary nebulae and such objects as seem to be related to young or evolving planetaries or progenitors. In particular, emphasis will be placed on the ratio of the isoelectronic lines of Si III 1893 and C III 1909. The data analysis will primarily make use of the SWP spectra on the master tape generated for the Atlas of IUE Spectra of Planetary Nebulae (ANGWF) so that essentially no additional images need be requested from the Data Center.|Y
NPIJK|Southern Planetary Nebulae|James B.|Kaler|Illinois|We continue to pursue problems regarding the evolution of planetary nebulae and their central stars. We propose to observe six objects selected from a recent survey of over 100 southern nebulae; four of these will include observations of both the nebulae and their nuclei. The purpose is to examine overabundances and mass-loss phenomena to see how these correlate with the masses and evolutionary states of the central stars, so as better to understand the creation of white dwarfs from the stars of the asymptotic giant branch.|Y
NPILA|Planetary Nebular C/O Ratios, Morphology, and Evolution|Lawrence|Aller|University of California|Some current theories of planetary nebulae morphology and evolution suggest that binary nuclei play important roles, particularly in the formation of bipolar and elliptically symmetrical objects with C/O > 1. An assessment of available data by Zuckerman and Aller showed how urgently needed are measurements of C/O ratios in order to give a satisfactory answer to this question. The C/O ratio and its possible variation with distance from the nucleus ran be established only with the aid of the UV lines observable with the IUE.|Y
NPITB|UV Spectra of Peculiar Planetary Nebulae|Timothy|Barker|Wheaton College|I am proposing to make IUE spectra of 14 planetary nebulae that I have identified as peculiar based on optical spectrophotometry. These represent a small subset of a sample of approximately 600 planetary nebulae for which I am obtaining optical spectra. All of the 14 planetary nebulae that I have selected have potentially unusual UV spectra, but none of them has been previously observed with the IUE.|Y
NPIWF|Bipolar and Evolving Planetary Nebulae and Realted Objects|Walter A.|Feibelman|NASA/GSFC|The scientific objectives of this proposed observing program are to obtain ultraviolet spectrograms of bipolar and evolving planetary nebulae and related objects that are thought to be young and possibly rapidly evolving objects. Most of these have not been previously observed with the IUE, but two (HM Sge and V1016 Cyg) are known to be variable and have shown dramatic changes in their optical as well as UV characteristics. Continued monitoring of these and related objects offers a rare opportunity to follow astrophysically important evolutionary patterns for a class of objects related to planetary nebulae. Low dispersion spectra are needed to determine emission line fluxes and changes in them as a function of time, central star temperatures, extinction parameters, and abundances; high dispersion spectra are needed for determination of electron densities from line ratios, for expansion velocities if the line profiles permit, and for terminal velocities and mass loss estimates when P Cygni profiles are present.|Y
NPJGF|Spectroscopy of Planetary Nebulae|Gary J.|Ferland|Ohio State University|Measurement of the primordial helium abundance Y from giant extragalactic H II regions is one of the main tests of the conventional hot big-bang and the resulting primordial nucleosynthesis. We recently pointed out that the most recent calculations of the cross section for excitation of the n =3 state of neutral helium show that collisions contribute to the line emissivity and that as a result, Y may have been overestimated by as much as 15%. This is important because the resulting value of Y is outside the range predicted by the conventional hot big-bang. We want to observe several planetary nebulae for which we have accurate measurements of the optical spectrum to check whether helium lines are indeed enhanced by the predicted amount. The ultraviolet data are important in determining the physical conditions in these nebulae. Our accurate measurement of the relative intensities of the full optical He I spectrum will then allow us to determine whether the amount of collisional enhancement is consistent with the observed spectrum, and thus provides a test of the reliability of the atomic data. This will then determine whether or not the primordial abundance of helium has been systematically overestimated.|Y
NPJHD|IUE Observations of NGC 2242|Harriet L.|Dinerstein|Texas|NGC 2242 was recently discovered to be a planetary nebula with a very unusual optical spectrum dominated by emission fines from highly-ionized species such as Ne V and He II, with no observed emission from neutral or singly-ionized species, including He I; this suggests that the nebula is matter-bounded rather than ionization-bounded, and that the ionizing star is very hot. Analysis of the optical [0 HI] lines suggests Te, ~ 20000  K and ne ~ 10^5 cm^-3, but neither quantity is well constrained because of insufficient data from density-sensitive emission fines in the optical spectrum. The remarkable nature of the spectrum and the nebula's relatively high galactic latitude led Huchra (1984) to suggest that NGC 2242 was a new member of the very small class of planetary nebulae belonging to the halo population of the galaxy. Photoionization models indicate that much of the emission-line flux from NGC 2242 should come from the UV lines of C III, C IV, N IV, N V, and O V. We propose to acquire a high-dispersion SWP exposure of NGC 2242 to obtain abundance information for carbon (and possibly nitrogen) and to obtain a density measurement which should allow us to determine whether the heavy element abundances are genuinely low in this nebula.|Y
NPJJC|O Star and Planetary Nebula in M22|Judith G.|Cohen|CIT|By groundbased follow up on an IRAS source, we have found an early O star near the center of M22. Associated with this star is a nebulosity with a rather peculiar optical spectrum. This is only the second planetary nebula known in a galactic globular cluster. We request IUE time to better determine the photospheric parameters of the hot star as well as to study the chemical abundances and ionization within the nebula.|Y
NPJST|Compact Planetary Nebulae. Carbon Abundances|Silvia|Torres-Peimbert|Mexico|We are Interested In investigating a set of young, compact, high density planetary nebulae In order to establish general characteristics that will help us understand better the evolution of planetary nebulae. In particular we are interested In deriving carbon abundances of J320, PC 11, NGC 6644, NGC 6790, NGC 6833, IC 5117, and He 2-2. At present there are several compact planetary nebulae for which there are IUE data available. We propose to enlarge the sample|Y
NPJTB|The Ionization Structure of Planetary Nebulae|Timothy|Barker|Wheaton College|I am proposing to make detailed UV observations of six carefully-selected planetary nebulae in order to complete a long-term study of the ionization structure of planetaries. The idea behind this study is to measure both optical and UV line intensities in the same positions in each nebula using similar entrance apertures. Since the ionization frequently changes drastically with position in an extended nebula, this procedure is almost essential in order to make a meaningful comparison between UV and optical measurements. To my knowledge, I am the only observer using this approach.  The ultimate goals of these studies are (1) to observe elements in more stages of ionization than is possible from optical spectra alone; this provides a check on optical ionization correction procedures, which are still useful for faint nebulae and for the much larger number (approximately 600) of planetaries that I am surveying optically, (2) by averaging measurements made in different parts of each nebula, to get particularly accurate total abundances so that small differences between nebulae will become apparent; such differences can be sensitive tests of theoretical predictions regarding CNO processing and mixing in the progenitors of planetaries, and (3) to further investigate the detailed physics of the emission processes in nebulae; such details are of general importance to theorists, and we need to understand them better in order to make more reliable abundance measurements in planetaries.|Y
NPJWF|Mass Loss From the Nucleus of PN 75 + 35 1|Walter A.|Feibelman|NASA/GSFC|Present observations suggest that the planetary nebula PN 75 +3501 together with A30 and A78 may be examples of objects now crossing the H-R diagram for a second time. Previous low resolution exposures of 75 +3501 (Feibelman 1987) revealed a strong UV continuum and a pronounced N V P-Cygni emission feature and no hint of other emission. The total absence of C III] 1909 A, which is usually the strongest emission in PNs, is rather puzzling. We propose to obtain a single, full-shift, high dispersion SWP exposure to this object to: a.) determine better the parameter of mass loss, b.) utilize the enhancement of emission over continuum flux high dispersion exposures to search for weak nebular emission, and c.) search for circumstellar absorption, possibly arising in an old faint, diffuse nebula. This observation will be used to further test the hypothesis that A30, A78, and 75 +3501 are crossing the H-R diagram for a second time.|Y
NPKHB|A Search for Binary Nuclei of Planetary Nebulae|Howard E.|Bond|STScI|We wish to obtain a complete sample of high quality, high signal-to-noise spectra for a distinct set of luminous planetary nuclei that have been observed with high resolution in the optical part of the spectrum. The optical observations provide accurate data on surface gravities, temperatures, and helium-to-hydrogen ratios. The UV observations will supply information on the existence and strengths of winds and on the chemical compositions. Correlation of the two data sets will thus allow us to determine the dependence of wind phenomena and wind properties on stellar parameters. As an integral part of this program we also wish to test for the existence of a unique but controversial jet that may be associated with the nucleus of He2-36, and to map much more deeply the UV spectrum of He 2-99, which has provided a fundamental atlas of line identifications. In particular we would like to examine decrements of carbon spectral series in order to constrain the mechanism of line production.|Y
NPKJK|Winds from Planetary Nebulae Nuclei|James B.|Kaler|Illinois|Abstract unavailable|N
NPKJL|A Unique Planetary Nebula Ejection from A Hot DA White Dwarf|James W.|Liebert|Arizona|We propose to obtain a long SWP high dispersion spectrum of a unique planetary nebula, combining US1 and ESA shifts and using the preceding last half of a US2 for acquisition and hopefully the start of the exposure. EGB/PG 0950+139 is a 70,000 K DA white dwarf surrounded by an extended, low surface brightness planetary nebula. Most importantly, It also possesses a bright, unresolved nebular component, which requires that an episode of very recent mass loss has occurred or Is still occurring. The compact nebula is very dense (~10**6 cm**-3), low in mass (~10**~8Msun) and small in size (~10 a.u.). Yet the central star has a cooling age as a white dwarf of several x 10**5 years. The compact nebula line spectrum Is unique from other planetary spectra In that many of the normal forbidden lines are quenched at the high densities.  The IUE high dispersion SWP spectrum is important for:(1) determining abundances of numerous species observable only at ultraviolet wavelengths, (2) refining electron density and temperature estimates, (3) searching for high Ionization emission lines which might provide evidence for ongoing mass loss, and (4) determining expansion velocities and radial velocities of the compact nebula and any wind from the white dwarf.|Y
NPKLA|Temperatures of Planetary Nebulae Nuclei, a Comparison of Methods|Lawrence H.|Aller|UCLA|Temperatures of planetary nebulae nuclei (PNN) are basic data for establishing bolometric corrections, luminosities, and evolutionary scenarios for these objects. while the classical Zanstra method often gives seemingly reliable results (see e.g. Henry and Shipman 1986), there still exist some outstanding problems which seem especially troublesome for some PN of high excitation. Alternative methods of temperature determination exist, notably the energy balance method (Preite-Martinez and Pottasch 1983), interpretation of the spectra of the dark line spectra of certain PNN (Kudritzki et al) and the representation of PN spectra by theoretical models. The latter procedure yields the effective temperature T(eff) of the central star along with other parameters such as the optical thickness at the Lyman limit and chemical abundances. For those few nebulae where its predictions can be compared with the precise Kudritzki method, the model nebula approach yields good results From a program of PN observed with the image tube scanner and analysed by theoretical nebular models we select a few including some with large discordances between T(eff) and Zanstra temperatures, TM. Zanstra gave a powerful tool for getting PNN temperatures, but the model nebula approach seems even more promising since it utilizes, in principle, all the relevant nebular spectral information. with IUE data we can not only improve theoretical models for each nebula; we can also get intrinsically superior T(Z)'s, because the PNN spectrum can be measured more accurately in the ultraviolet.|Y
NPKRD|CNO Abundances in Type I Planetary Nebulae|Reginald J.|Dufour|Rice University|We propose to obtain low dispersion SWP and LWP spectra of 10- 15 of the Heand N-rich Type I planetary nebulae. These data and archival data on approximately 10 such nebulae previously observed will be analyzed in a consistent manner coupled with extensive ground-based spectrophotometry to derive abundances with special emphasis on the CNO element group. The results should provide a coherent set of abundances for some 25 Type I PNe which would enable a detailed investigation of CNO variations in these nebulae and their effects on galactic chemical evolution. Of particular interest will be comparison of the abundance enhancements and depletions with current models of nucleosynthesis in intermediate mass stars (2-6+M(sun)). Specific items of interest are how constant is Sigma[C+N+O] and Sigma[N+O] with composition and progenitor mass, evidence for Odestruction, and if the nature of the N-enhancements are the result of primary or secondary nucleosynthesis.|Y
NPKSM|Type I Planetaries in Magellanic Clouds|Stephen P.|Maran|NASA/GSFC|We propose to investigate the ultraviolet spectra of five Type I planetary nebulae in the Magellanic Clouds for which reliable groundbased spectrophotometry has recently become available (Barlow 1986). The ratio of the ultraviolet and visible He II recombination lines will then allow us to determine accurate reddenings for the nebulae, which are at known distances. Given this information, calibrated emission line fluxes from the IUE spectra, together with the published visual spectrophotometry and additional visual observations planned by one of us (Meatheringham) will permit us to calculate physical models. In particular, we will determine the chemical compositions, including the C abundances, of this sample of Herich, N-rich high-excitation nebulae, which are likely to have relatively high-mass central stars (Peimbert and Torres-Peimbert 1983). The abundances found in this work (for example, ratios of carbon to oxygen vs. nitrogen to oxygen), can be compared with calculations of stellar evolution on the asymptotic giant branch, according to which they should reflect the mass of the progenitor star.|Y
NPKST|Research on Plaetary Nebulae|Silvia|Torres-Peimbert|Mexico|We are interested in investigating different aspects of planetary nebulae: (A) Carbon Abundances of Compact Planetary Nebulae. We want to observe a set of young, compact, high density planetary nebulae in order to establish general characteristics that will help us understand better the evolution of Planetary nebulae. In particular we are interested in deriving carbon abundances of K3-63. At present there are several compact planetary nebulae for which there are IUE data available. We propose to enlarge the sample.  (B) Characteristics of Nearby Planetary Nebula ESO 166 - PN21. We are also interested in deriving the stellar characteristics of the exciting star of the PN ESO 166-PN21 that has been found to be of extremely low luminosity (L < 47 L(sun)). This object could be a fossil PN. We are also interested in determining the carbon. nitrogen and neon abundance in some bright region= of the nebula.  (C) Extremely High Excitation Nebuale. We want to construct ionization structure models of PN of very high degree of ionization. The object NGC 2242, previously classified as a galaxy shows an extremely high degree of excitation. For this object most of the oxygen is in the form of O^+3 and O^+4 and therefore from optical observations it is not possible to determine the O/H ratio. UV observations are needed for this purpose. Other objects that belong to these group are NGC 4161 and NGC 2610.|Y
NPKWF|Evolved Nuclei of Two Planetary Nebulae|Walter A.|Feibelman|NASA/GSFC|The objective of this program is to obtain low dispersion IUE spectra of two unusually faint nuclei of the large, old planetary nebulae, IW-l and IW-2. The data in the visual region of Ishida and Weinberger (1987) show that these stars are central stars of PN with apparent diameters about half the size of the Moon and with very low surface brightness, at ~ 25 mag arcsec^-2. The optical data suggest highly evolved stars with temperatures and dimensions of white dwarfs. Regardless of the final interpretation, it is inescapable to conclude that these stars are perhaps the most highly evolved nuclei of PN yet known. These stars, therefore, represent an important target for study by the IUE of late stages of stellar evolution. We previously obtained 2 low dispersion SWP (2 and 4 hr) spectra during a US2 shift of the fainter of the two, IW-2 (V = 17.7 mag!). Although these data were very suggestive, an additional SWP image with longer exposure time is required to determine the actual nature of this object. The brighter IW-l has never been observed with the IUE.|Y
NPLRD|CNO Abundance in Type I Planetary Negulae|Reginald J.|Dufour|Rice|We propose to obtain low dispersion SWP and LWP spectra of 10- 15 of the Heand N-rich Type I planetary nebulae. These data and archival data on approximately 10 such nebulae previously observed will be analyzed in a consistent manner coupled with extensive ground-based spectrophotometry to derive abundances with special emphasis on the CNO element group. The results should provide a coherent set of abundances for some 25 Type I PNe which would enable a detailed investigation of CNO variations in these nebulae and their effects on galactic chemical evolution. Of particular interest will be comparison of the abundance enhancements and depletions with current models of nucleosynthesis in intermediate mass stars (2-6+M(sun). Specific items of interest are how constant is Sigma[C+N+Oj and Sigma[N+O] with composition and progenitor mass, evidence for Odestruction, and if the nature of the N-enhancements are the result of primary or secondary nucleosynthesis.|Y
NPNTB|IUE Spectra of Peculiar Planetary Nebula|Timothy|Barker|Wheaton College|I am proposing to make UV observations of 11 planetary nebulae that I have identified as peculiar based on optical spectrophotometry. These represent a small subset of a survey of several hundred planetary nebulae for which I am obtaining optical spectra. All of these 11 objects have potentially unusual UV spectra, and none of them has been observed previously with the IUE.|Y

NRBAW|Phase Function Studies in Reflection Nebulae with IUE|Adolf N.|Witt|Toledo|The scattering phase function of interstellar grains is an excellent clue to our understanding of a series of important astrophysical processes and mechanisms involving grains and their interaction with radiation and the surrounding gas. Questions involving the rate of molecule formation in dense clouds, the size distribution of interstellar grains and the related topics of grain formation, growth and destruction, the infrared spectra of H II regions, and the mechanism responsible for the surprisingly high scattering efficiency of interstellar grains in the ultraviolet all would be advanced significantly toward a solution if the wavelength dependence of the phase function shape of grains were known.  While designed primarily for ultraviolet spectroscopy at relatively high resolution, the IUE possesses unique qualifications enabling it to carry out a program to study the ultraviolet phase function of grains in reflection nebulae. These qualifications, which distinguish the IUE with respect to all previous astronomical instruments in space, are its high spatial resolution, its excellent rejection of scattered light from bright sources outside the field, and its ability to integrate for long periods of time for the successful measurement of small fluxes.  We propose to use the IUE in a low-resolution mode to study the nebular light of three reflection nebulae at several close angular distances from the illuminating stars. |Y
NRDAW|Illuminating Stars of Reflection Nebulae Observed by ANS TDTD-1|Adolf N.|Witt|Toledo|We propose to observe the central stars in ten reflection nebulae with the purpose of obtaining measurements of the ultraviolet flux distributions of the stars without nebular contamination. The same objects have previously been observed by TD-1 with a 12x17 aperture and by ANS with a 2!5x2!5 aperture, thus including nebular flux to a different degree. By reducing all three series of measurements to the same flux scale and by substracting the IUE fluxes from those measured by TD-1 and ANS, we anticipate deriving the nebular fluxes themselves.  The method developed by Witt and Cottrell (1980) designed to yield information on the basic parameters describing the surface brightness distribution of the nebulae, log (S/F)100" and p, will then be applied to the data. Ground-based observations of the same nebulae are planned to provide values of these two|Y
NRHAW|The Unusual Reflection Nebula CED 201|Adolf N.|Witt|Toledo|We are proposing to obtain low-resolution spectra of the reflection nebula Ced 201, its illuminating star BD+69 1231 and the nearby, approximately equidistant star BD+69 1232. Ced 201 has been shown recently to exhibit extended near-IR emission and, because of the relatively late spectral type (B 9.5V) of its illuminating star, has become a key object in identifying the spectral region in the UV, from which the radiation exciting the near-IR emission originates. This critical spectral region appears to be the 1800 A < lambda < 2500 A range.  It is the aim of this study to investigate the extinction characteristics of the dust in Ced 201 and in the intervening interstellar space through the determination and comparison of the UV extinction curves for BD+69 1231 and BD+69 1232, and to derive the absorption part of the extinction by comparing the nebular spectrum of Ced 201, i.e. the dust scattered spectrum, with the spectrum of the illuminating star, BD+69 1231. For this analysis a recently developed color-difference technique capable of revealing significant variations of dust scattering properties with wavelength will be employed. This technique offers the advantage of not being specifically dependent on any assumed nebular geometry. It is expected that the successful completion of this study will contribute to the more precise characterization and ultimate identification of the dust component responsible for extended near-IR emission and the associated unidentified near-IR emission features at 3.3, 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, and 11.3 micron wavelength.|Y
NRIRF|The Nature of the Filamentary Nebula 1723-46|Robert A.|Fesen|Colorado - CASA|A nearly spherical, 40 diameter filamentary emission nebula, 1723-46, was discovered by Meaburn and Rovithis (1977) who suggested it was a previously unrecognized large and very old supernova remnant (SNR). Recently, however, Bedford et al (1984), using optical Na I D absorption lines in the spectra of 5 stars aligned with the nebula's rim, concluded that while probably a SNR, its distance was less than 200 pc, had a diameter of < 17.5 pc, an age of 20,000 yrs, and an initial energy of only 2 x 10^47 ergs.  Although possessing a morphology, optical emission-line properties, and radio emission strongly suggestive of an old SNR, a distance of < 200 pc appears highly improbable. This would make it the closest SNR known, yet among the smallest, but intrinsically faintest with an initial energy estimate three orders of magnitude below typical SNR estimates. At a more likely distance of 1.0 - 1.5 kpc, the object would be 75 - 100 pc in diameter with an energy of 10^50 ergs if its expansion velocities are 50 - 75 km s^1 - characteristics perfectly consistent with those of a very old SNR. If this is the case, because of its great age and size, its well defined structure, and isolation off the galactic plane (b = -6), 1723-46 becomes quite valuable for studying the properties of extremely evolved optical SNRs near the end of the adiabatic stage.  In order to determine the nebula's true nature, we propose to obtain high dispersion IUE spectral data on several target stars lying in the nebula's direction for the purpose of detecting high velocity absorption interstellar features. These data will provide reliable distance, expansion velocity, and energy information which will determine 1723-46's actual properties.|Y
NRITS|Depletions in Reflection Nebulae Containing Tiny Grains|Theodore P.|Snow|Colorado - CASA|We propose to carry out abundance and depletion analyses for lines of sight to stars in reflection nebulae, in order to look for possible systematic constrasts in depletion behavior as compared with normal diffuse interstellar clouds. The principle reason to do this is that for several reflection nebulae, infrared photometric data indicate the presence of very tiny(10 A) grains. If such grains are present in large numbers, they may dominate the surface area available for gas particles to stick onto, so the depletions may be enhanced in regions containing tiny grains. Even if this is not the case (for example, if it turns out that the grains exist everywhere, and not just in reflection nebulae), the study of depletions in reflection nebulae should prove interesting because of the unusual environment, particularly the high UV radiation field, that the material is subjected to. We plan to use multiple exposures, obtained with the target stars in different positions in the large aperture, in order to reduce detector noise by coadding spectra.|Y
NRJWB|UV Spectra of PKS 1209-52|William P.|Blair|Johns Hopkins|We propose full shift SWP and LWP exposures of a position in the southern galactic supernova remnant PKS 1209-52. IUE observations of this remnant are demonstrated to be feasible by comparing to recently available optical data and are desirable for several reasons. PKS 1209-52 will be only the third evolved galactic supernova remnant with IUE data of sufficient quality for a reasonably detailed analysis of its filaments. The IUE spectra will be combined with new X-ray, optical and radio data on this remnant, permitting a more detailed investigation. Comparison to the Cygnus Loop and Vela remnants will allow more general conclusions about the shock wave/interstellar medium interaction to be drawn.|Y
NRKAW|Large-Angle Scattering in Reflection Nebulae and the Grain Size Distribution|Adolf N.|Witt|Toledo|We are proposing to obtain low-resolution IUE-spectra of three reflection nebulae, IC 59, IC 63, and IC 5076, which are detached from their respective illuminating stars and are therefore very likely to scatter at large scattering angles. Similar spectra are to be obtained for the illuminating stars. From these observations we intend to derive the wavelength dependence of the amplitude of the scattering phase function and thus information on the phase function asymmetry in the UV. our ultimate goal is the determination of the size distribution of grains responsible for UV scattering, especially of the small-particle component.  A special bonus of the proposed program will be the opportunity to study the spectrum of the Be star gamma Cas, the illuminating star of IC 59 and IC 63, from two additional directions via reflection. This provides a unique chance to test the geometrical model generally assumed for Be stars.|Y
NRKWB|UV Observations of N49 and M1|William P.|Blair|Johns Hopkins University|Recent re-analysis of archival IUE data on supernova remnants has brought to our attention two objects with previous FM observations for which the observational record is incomplete. N49 is the highest surface brightness supernova remnant in the Large Magellanic Cloud, but only one SWP spectrum of it has ever been taken, and this was during IUE's first year. The remnant was readily detected, but no corresponding long wavelength spectrum was ever obtained. We request time to observe two positions in this remnant. Also, our careful re-analysis of the existing IUE data on the Crab Nebula (=Ml=NGC1952) has led us to the conclusion that observations at two different positions in this remnant are not only feasible, but desirable, to study possible elemental variations in the nebula.|Y

NSBAD|Ultraviolet Observations of Supernova Remnants|Andrea K.|Dupree|Smithsonian|We wish to study the ultraviolet emission of supernova remnants in the early and middle phases of evolution. By using the spectra of young remnants, we can study the interaction of the high velocity material with the interstellar medium and we can investigate the elemental abundances of matter which has undergone nuclear burning. In the older remnants, we hope to elucidate the relationship between the X-ray emitting gas and the optical filaments. From an understanding of the UV spectra we can learn a great deal about the nature of the interstellar medium encountered by the blast wave.|Y
NSBGW|Kinematics and Physical Conditions in Shocked Clouds in Supernova Remnants|George|Wallerstein|Washington|We request observing time and financial support to observe interstellar gas in the Vela supernova remnant with the IUE satellite. The data will be used to construct a model of the shocked clouds in the expanding nebula. The main features of the model that can be established by these observations are the velocities and the state of ionization. In this way we can begin to understand the effect that the supernova in Vela had on the surrounding interstellar medium when it blew up about twenty thousand years ago and released 5 x 10^50 ergs of energy. That energy was released in a few minutes or hours and is the same as given off by the sun in five billion years.|Y
NSBKD|Emission Lines in the Crab Nebula|Kris|Davidson|University of Minesota|We propose to use the IUE to obtain ultraviolet emission-line spectra of one or two selected regions in the Crab Nebula. Such data would be highly useful in at least two important ways: (1) To improve theoretical ionization models which are used to deduce elemental abundances from the visual-wavelength spectra of the supernova remnant, and (2) to determine whether carbon is significantly "overabundant" in the Crab.|Y
NSBRK|Supernova Remnants and Nucleosynthesis|Robert|Kirshner|Michigan|There is widespread belief that supernovae have something to do with nucleosynthesis. In two remnants, Cassiopeia A and N132D (in the Large Magellanic Cloud) material that was ripped from the mantle of the exploding star is exposed for our examination there we see evidence for abundances that are far from the usual cosmic ratios. Precise determinations of those abundances would permit an estimate of the mass of the star that erupted, constraints on stellar mixing during late evolutionary stages, and evidence on explosive nucleosynthesis. We propose to use the IUE to observe these objects to provide line strengths for elements which are crucial to understanding the nucleosynthesis, but are difficult to measure from the ground. In particular, an 8 hour observation of Cas A would provide significant information on magnesium, oxygen, and carbon despite substantial interstellar absorption. In N132D, measurements of carbon, oxygen, silicon and magnesium can be obtained.|Y
NSBSM|Selected Filaments in the Crab Nebula|Stephen P.|Maran|NASA/GSFC|We will make absolute measurements of fluxes in ultraviolet emission lines at carefully chosen locations in selected filaments of the Crab Nebula supernova remnant. Comparison of these measurements with those obtained for certain visible light lines will enable us to determine the interstellar extinction to the Crab with greater accuracy than previously and to determine the carbon abundance in the nebula. We will also verify that the wavelength dependence of the nebular continuum in the IUE wavelength range agrees with that predicted from the observed continua in the visible and x-ray ranges and we will determine the spectral character of the photoionizing flux that excites the filaments. (And investigate the possibility of significant collisional ionization.) The results of this project will bear on the nature of the pre supernova star, the type of supernova that gave rise to the Crab remnant and the mass of the filaments.|Y
NSCAD|Ultraviolet Observations of the Cygnus Loop and Other Shocks|Andrea K.|Dupree|CFA|IUE spectra of supernova remnants (SNR's) have already provided exciting new information on shock velocities and grain destruction, but the information about the nature of the pre-shock interstellar medium is ambiguous. To follow up our present program of sampling a wide variety of filaments in the Cygnus Loop and other SNR's, we propose to study the NW section in more detail, to observe the UV emission from the faster intercloud shock, and to observe another shock in the interstellar medium associated with a Herbig-Haro object.|Y
NSCGW|Kinematics and Physical Conditions in Shocked Clouds in the Monoceros Supernova Remnant|George|Wallerstein|Washington|We request observing time and financial support to observe interstellar gas in the Monoceros Supernova remnant with the IUE Satellite. The data will be used to construct a model of the shocked clouds in the expanding nebula. The main features of the model that can be established by these observations are the velocities and the state of ionization. In this way we can begin to understand the effect that the supernova in Monoceros had on the surrounding interstellar medium when it blew up about a hundred thousand years ago and released 5 x 10^50 ergs of energy. That energy was released in a few minutes or hours and is the same as given off by the sun in five billion years. Since the Monoceros Loop is one of the oldest recognizeable supernovae remnants, its comparison with the much younger Vela remnant will be particularly interesting.|Y
NSCKD|Observations of the Crab Nebula|K.|Davidson|Minnesota|The Crab Nebula is the only young supernova remnant that can be observed with the IUE. Ultraviolet spectra of certain filaments in the Crab should be very useful for estimating relative He/C/N/O abundance ratios there--which are extremely important for testing many theoretical ideas that have been mooted, concerning the nature of the Crab supernova event and its precursor star.  In August 1979, we made enough preliminary IUE observations of the Crab Nebula to show that ultraviolet emission lines from the two or three brightest filaments are indeed detectable with this instrument. However, in order to obtain reliable estimates of the relative line intensities, a larger effort will be necessary; the Crab seems to represent practically the limit of what can be done with the IUE, and such things as background corrections and "radiation spots" must be treated with great care. The importance of the Crab, and the fact that our preliminary data are slightly different than expected, justifies a major effort with IUE. Therefore, we are asking for IUE time for this purpose.|Y
NSDJR|Ultraviolet Observations of the Cygnus Loop|John C.|Raymond|CFA|The Cygnus Loop is by far the most readily observable supernova remnant in the ultraviolet. We have made detailed analyses of IUE and optical spectra of several positions in the Cygnus Loop, and we request additional observing time to resolve some of the questions raised by the earlier studies. The departures from steady flow seen at many positions are only crudely understood, At present the shocked cloudlet model, the transition between adiabatic and "snowplow" phases, or thermal instability in the post-shock flow are viable alternatives. Carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and neon all seem to be depleted by a factor of two compared with solar abundances, while model calculations predict that carbon should be much more severely depleted than the other elements. Some lines are attenuated by resonant scattering. Long exposures on two filaments, mapping across two filaments, and absorption line and reddening studies of nearby stars will provide some of the answers.|Y
NSDNT|Absorption Line Studies of Supernova Remnants in the Large Magellanic Cloud|N.|Thonnard|Carnegie Institute of Washington|Observations of supernova remnants (SNR's) (Jenkins et al., 1976) have shown that absorption line studies can sample a higher velocity region than can be seen in emission. In addition, in the UV, absorption lines sample the large amounts of ionized gas in remnants. Although in our own Galaxy, extinction along the plane limits the number of remnants that can be studied in this manner, remnants in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) are accessible with high sensitivity on IUE. The Magellanic Clouds have a well-studied sample of remnants (14 in the Large Cloud, Matthewson and Clarke, 1973), which have a single well-established distance. The LMC is at a good viewing angle, and also has SNR's which have been observed in the x-ray with the Einstein Observatory.  We propose to use the IUE high dispersion mode at short wavelength to observe OB supergiants in the direction of one of the LMC remnants. These will be clustered in the remnant where optical absorption at high velocity (120 km1s) has been seen for one of the stars. Velocities of UV absorption components distinct from the 0-300 km/s range spanned by gas in our Galaxy and the LMC can unambiguously be attributed to the remnant. From the maximum velocity component in the remnant's frame, we can determine a lower limit to the blast wave velocity. This in turn can be used to check determinations of spectral temperature made in X-ray observations (Long and Helfand, 1979). From line strengths in a variety of highly ionized species (e.g., CIV, SIV, SiIII) along with shock models incorporating the measured blast wave velocity we can characterize the elemental abundance of gas in supernova shocks in the LMC, and possibly also of the interstellar gas in the LMC. Properties determined for the SNR in the LMC will be compared with derived properties of three SNR's for which UV studies have been made in the Galaxy.|Y
NSDTG|A Very Young Supernova Remnant in the Large Magellanic Cloud|Theodore R.|Gull|NASA/GSFC|Mathewson, Dopita, Tuohy and Ford (1980) have recently discovered the optical counterpart of 'the radio/x-ray supernova remnant (SNR) 0540-69.3 in the Large Magellanic Cloud. It consists of an intense 8 arcsec (1.6 pc) diameter annulus of [OIII] 5007A emission centered at alpha  = 05h 40m 35.2s, delta = 69 21'14.3" (1950). Spectroscopic observations of the [OIII] feature show a high velocity dispersion (~3000 km s^-1), indicative of a supernova remnant - 500 years of age. To date, the structure has been imaged in [OIII] 5007A and [NII] 6584A. No H-beta emission is visible.  IUE observations of N158A are of great interest as the ejecta from the supernova probably has not mixed with significant amounts of the ambient interstellar gas. Hence we may be able to get estimates of H/He/C/N/O abundance ratios using IUE plus ground-based spectrophotometry. N158A may be the only young SNR, other than the Crab, by which we can use IUE to study the nature of a supernova event and its precurser star.|Y
NSEJR|Ultraviolet Spectra of Non-Radiative Shock Waves|John C.|Raymond|CFA|UV and optical emission has been observed from a fast, nonradiative shock wave In The Cygnus Loop. These spectra provide unique determinations of the shock velocity and elemental abundances before grains are destroyed In the post-shock gas. With further spectra of The Cygnus Loop, we will obtain information on higher velocity shocks and electron-ion equilibration in collisionless shocks. An observation of SN1006 will provide the first determination of the shock velocity In that remnant.|Y
NSERF|A Radial Mapping of the Cygnus Loop's UV Emission|Robert|Fesen|NASA/GSFC|Ultraviolet emission lines from supernova remnants are unique diagnostic tools for estimating a remnant's shock velocity, elemental abundances as well as many pre-shock ISM conditions. To date, only a random and biased sampling of the Cygnus Loop's filaments have been studied in the UV which, although important and useful, leave the gross spectral properties of the remnant uncertain. Furthermore, these investigations have ignored the large and systematic radial distribution of emission line intensities found from optical studies and which has probably lead to the discordant analysis by past observers. We propose a systematic study of a limited but representative cross-section of the remnant's northeastern filaments (NGC 6992) which covers the full range of ionization conditions. High quality optical data for these regions have already been obtained by us. This new approach of coordinating UV and optical emission data on intelligently selected filaments characteristic of the remnant's radial ionization structure is likely to be the best way of investigating the deficiencies in the models and the physical variations in the post-shock gas.|Y
NSEWB|CArbon Abundance in M33 & M31 From Supernova Remnants|William P.|Blair|CFA|Observations of H II regions in nearby galaxies have indicated that metal abundances systematically decrease at large galactocentric distances, but the magnitude of these "abundance gradients" remains uncertain because of many uncertainties In the analysts of the H II region data. Observations of supernova remnants In the nearby galaxies M33 and M31 have been used In conjunction with shock model calculations to determine abundance gradients for comparlson with the H II region results. However, the carbon abundance 13 an important and unknown variable In the supernova remnant analysis. We wish to observe several of these extragalactic supernova remnants with IUE to determine the abundance of carbon directly from the C III] 1910 and C IV 1550 emission lines.|Y
NSFCW|Ultraviolet Observations of the Blue Star Projected in the Remnant of Supernova AD1006|Chi-Chao|Wu|CSC|After the analysis and preliminary interpretation of the IUE data we obtained for the Schweizer-Middleditch star, we are proposing to acquire additional IUE spectra for this star to improve the signalto-noise ratio of the data which will allow us to have a more quantitative understanding of the SNR 1006AD and the S-M star itself. The detection of strong Fe II UV1, 2 and 3 multiplets conclusively shows the presence of huge amount of iron in the SNR. The failure to detect iron lines in the X-rays is due to the fact that in young SNRs, almost all the iron is cold. But we need better SIN to get accurate profiles and equivalent widths for these and additional (UV8 and UV9) multiplets in order to disentangle the effects of fine structure excitation, saturation and velocity broadening. Only when we have a better understanding of these effects can we derive a tight lower limit of the amount of iron in the SNR. Several strong lines in our existing data have been identified as silicon lines redshifted by ~+5000 km s^-1. Better data is needed to detect weaker line(s) which will strengthen our identification and to establish velocity shift more precisely. Then we can state with more certainty that the outer ejecta is less chemically processed and it is (or is not) being slowed down by the ambient gas and the reverse shock causes it to break down into clumps. And one of the clumps on the far side of the SNR (V ~ +5000 km s^-1) lies on our line of sight to the S-M star and gives the strong redshifted Si lines. Improved data is also needed to confirm or refute the very suggestive presence of Co and Ni lines. Increased S/N will allow the Lyman-alpha profile of the S-M star be established and its continuum corrected for reddening using the depth of the 2200 A dust feature. We intend to perform detailed white dwarf model atmosphere computations when reliable Lyman a lpha profile and continuum shape are available.|Y
NSFJR|Deep Exposures on the Cygnus Loop|John C.|Raymond|CFA|European and US shifts will be combined to obtain the long exposures necessary to study a non-radiative shock at the edge of the Cygnus Loop and to obtain a Small Aperture spectrum of a bright Cygnus Loop filament. With the non-radiative shock spectrum we will study the physics of the shock front Itself. The small aperture spectrum will help to determine the silicon depletion and silicate grain destruction as well as the importance of resonance line scattering within the emitting gas.|Y
NSFRF|UV Studies of Type I SNRS in the Large Magellanic Cloud|Robert A.|Fesen|NASA/GSFC|The Einstein Observatory's IPC Survey of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and follow-up optical and radio studies, have led to the exciting discovery of three very young type-I SNRs (Tuohy, et al. 1982). Because of their very high shock velocities and the small amount of reddening to the LMC (Av = 0.2), these remnants offer us a unique opportunity for studying very young remnants and specifically those produced by Type I SN events. Recent UV observations of the Cygnus Loop indicate that IUE observations for these LMC SNRs are not only feasible but can provide unique and important information concerning the emission mechanisms in high-velocity non-radiative shocks. Our specific objectives are: 1) use of the post-shock temperature sensitive emission lines to help resolve the question of equilibrium timescales in the post shock flow, 2) investigation of Lyman-alpha broadened wings (Halpha indicates velocities up to 3600 km/s) thereby determining whether or not the Lyman lines are optically thin, and 3) Comparison with prediction plus UV observations of much slower shock velocities (~200 to 400 km s^-1) in the non-radiative filaments observed by us with J. Raymond in the Cygnus Loop.|Y

However, the abundance of carbon Is an Important and unknown variable In these analyses. We wish to obtain long, collaborative exposures with IUE of several of the least reddened supernova remnants In M33 and M31 to determine the carbon abundance directly from the C III]  I910 and C IV 1550 lines and to investigate the possibility of a gradient In the abundance of carbon In M33.|Y
NSGJR|The Cygnus Loop|John C.|Raymond|CFA|We wish to obtain ultraviolet spectra of several filaments in the southeastern section of the Cygnus Loop as part of a collaboration involving optical, X-ray and radio observers. In particular, calibrated images in eight optical lines make it possible to select the most valuable positions for UV study. We hope to reach a consistent interpretation for data at all of these wavelengths in. order to test theories that we have recently developed for the optical and UV emission of a cloud struck by a blast wave in the intercloud medium.|Y
NSGRF|A Study of Grain Destruction in the Cygnus Loop Supernova Remnant|Robert A.|Fesen|Colorado-LASP|Supernova remnants are believed to play a significant role in altering both the population and structure of dust grains in the interstellar medium. Shock models with grain-grain collisions and sputtering have suggested that substantial grain destruction can occur at velocities as low as 40 km s^-1. Recent calculations by Seab and Shull (1983) have also suggested that the strength of the 2200 A bump and the far ultraviolet rise in extinction should increase by shock processing. However, it has been difficult to identify clear instances where variations observed among differing regions can be attributed to SNR shocks.  For investigating shock induced grain destruction in remnants, the Cygnus Loop remnant offers an unique opportunity. The whole western boundary of this SNR is bordered by a large obscuring dust region. The demarcation between high and low star counts matches almost perfectly the remnant's western optical filaments, suggesting some grain disruption by the remnant's shock front. Moreover, the Cygnus Loop is a relatively nearby object (770 pc) with very little foreground extinction [E(B-V) = 0.071 to complicate the analysis.  We propose, therefore, to obtain low dispersion ultraviolet spectra of several carefully selected stars in and surrounding the remnant and dust region. Our objectives are: 1) to provide the first direct evidence for SN generated grain processing; 2) to obtain data on changes to the 2200 A feature as well as the extinction curve across the western filaments; and 3) to compare the observed results to those recently predicted through grain-grain collision and sputtering calculations by Seab and Shull (1983).|Y

These data will be used in conjunction with various theoretical calculations to (1) derive the physical conditions of the emitting gas, (2) find the abundances of carbon and silicon relative, to oxygen, and (3) estimate the mass of the precursor star that created this remnant. Optical data indicate that the reddening toward the remnant is low (E(B-V) < 0.05), and shock models are used to demonstrate the feasibility of detecting this remnant with IUE.|Y
NSHJR|A Cloud Struck by the Cygnus Loop Blast Wave|John C.|Raymond|CFA|According to current theories of the structure of the interstellarmedium, the interaction between a supernova remnant blast wave and dense clouds determines the evolution of the supernova remnant and the global energy and mass balance between hot and cool phases of the interstellar gas. Several detailed theoretical models of this interaction are available. IUE spectra of a bow shock feature discovered in optical and X-ray images of the southeastern section of the Cygnus Loop will test the models and measure the energy and mass transfer during the collision of the blast wave with an interstellar cloud.|Y
NSIKB|A Test of Bow-Shock Models of HH-Objects Using IUE Spectra|Karl-Heinz|Bohm|Washington|We plan to test our predictions of emission line intensities, continuum energy distributions and their spatial variation in bow shock models of Herbig-Haro objects using archival IUE spectra. The reason for considering such bow shock models is that they have been quite successful in explaining optical positionvelocity diagrams and (at least in some cases) overcoming some earlier apparent contradictions between the shock wave interpretation of optical and ultraviolet spectra. Since it is not yet completely clear how the bow-shock interpretation of spectra will eventually be incorporated into the concept of bipolar jets (in which HH objects seem to be "imbedded") we find it very important to test the range and the limits of applicability of the bow-shock models to Herbig-Haro object spectra. This requires ultraviolet and optical spectra. We propose to use all available archival IUE spectra of Herbig-Haro objects for this purpose.|Y

NSIRF|UV Emission-Line Diagnostics for Low-Velocity Shocks|Robert A.|Fesen|Colorado - CASA|Ultraviolet emission-lines produced by interstellar shock waves and observed in supernova remnants (SNRs) have greatly enhanced our understanding of the properties of both individual remnants and the ISM. Ultraviolet emissionlines help govern the nebula's physical conditions and thus provide unique diagnostic tools for determining shock velocity, elemental abundance and grain destruction, as well as preshock ISM conditions.  For investigating the UV properties of shocks, the Cygnus Loop remnant is ideal. It is large, very bright, spatially well resolved into filaments, has very low interstellar extinction, and exhibits a diversity of spectral line intensities in the optical indicative of a wide range of shock velocities.  Although numerous IUE spectra have already been obtained on the Cygnus Loop and other SNRs, the shock velocities observed to date have been relatively high (100 - 140 km s^-1) with virtually no data on shocks of low-velocity. Decreased UV line intensity with decreasing shock velocity coupled with the relatively low surface brightness of the low-velocity filaments observed so far have prevented useful UV observations. Nonetheless, such data are important in order to thoroughly test shock model predictions over the complete range of observed remnant shock velocities as well as to provide diagnostic information for more sensitive future UV shock studies.  Towards this goal, we have recently identified optically two positions in the Cygnus Loop which are perhaps the brightest filaments having spectra indicative of 60 - 70 km s^-1 shocks. We therefore propose to obtain UV spectral data on these regions using IUE for the purpose of finally obtaining observational and diagnostic information on interstellar shocks of lowvelocity.|Y

NSJRF|Detecting Enriched Ejacta in the Remnant of SN 185 AD|Robert A.|Fesen|Colorado - CASA|Low dispersion IUE spectra of early-type stars lying behind young galactic supernova remnants can provide extremely valuable and unique information via line-of-sight interception of a remnant's ejecta producing strong absorptions lines. From such data, one can directly probe the elemental composition of the remnant's cool ejecta and, in turn, obtain some clue as to the type of supernova involved and explosive nucleosynthesis. Although realized for sometime as a potentially powerful technique due to the great sensitivity of heavy element resonance UV lines for detecting even very low column densities, in practice this method has been attempted only once due to problems in identifying early-type background target stars as well as reddening limitations.  The one previous study using this technique has yielded exciting and very important new data on the remnant of SN 1006 AD. Analysis of IUE data for a faint sdOB star situated behind this young supernova remnant show the presence of very strong and definitely non-stellar absorption lines in this star's UV spectrum due to several individual knots of ejecta along the line-of-sight. These features are identified as redshifted S II (1259, 1254), O I (1302), and Si IV (1393, 1402) respectively at radial velocities of 5000 to 6700 krn s^-1 (Fesen, Wu, Leventhal, and Hamilton 1986). Also, very broad and strong absorption Fe II lines at 2370 and 2600 A indicate an Fe II mass of about 0.1 solar mass. This IUE detection is presently the only direct observation of the expected large mass of iron in SN 1006.  Obviously, one would very much like to apply this now proven method to investigate other young galactic supernova remnants. Recent SNR studies indicate there is one (but presently only one) young SNR for which similar observations are possible, namely SN 185 (= RCW 86). Estimates for the remnant's distance have recently decreased from 2.5 kpc to < 1.5 kpc and this together with new, more accurate radio maps make UV observations now feasible. We, therefore, propose, to investigate SN 185's interstellar absorbing material using IUE. We have identified two excellently placed and distant B stars located in the remnant's direction. A positive detection of one or more absorption lines will provide invaluable data on the remnant's ejecta composition and velocities, while a null detection will place constraints the remnant's distance and interpretations of the its X-ray emission.|Y
NSJWB|A Face-On Shock in the Cygnus Loop|William P.|Blair|Johns Hopkins|We wish to obtain 7 hour SWP and LWP exposures at the location of a face-on shock in the Cygnus Loop. No IUE spectra of a filament with this morphology have been obtained previously. The effects of resonance scattering should be much lower in a filament with this geometry, which will permit a more accurate assessment of the carbon abundance and grain destruction in the shock. Comparison will be made to existing data on Miller's (1974) position 3, which shows a similar optical spectrum but an edge-on geometry.|Y
NSKPW|The Composition of Supernova Ejecta in Puppis A|P. Frank|Winkler|Middlebury|We propose to obtain confirming ultraviolet spectra of the recently discovered "Omega" filament in the Puppis A supernova remnant (SNR). Optical and nearinfrared spectra show that this filament has a radial velocity of 1500 km/sec and is composed primarily of oxygen and other heavy elements (Winkler and Kirshner 1985). Proper-motion measurements of the omega and other similar but fainter filaments indicate a systematic pattern of undecelerated expansion from a common center near the middle of Puppis A (Winkler et al. 1987). These facts strongly suggest that these filaments are fragments of supernova ejecta which have remained relatively uncontaminated by interaction with interstellar material, similar to the fast-moving knots in the much younger Cas A SNR.  The IUE wavelength band includes strong ultraviolet lines of C, 0, Mg, and Si. This set of elements, together with the 0, Ne and S already observed in optical spectra, include most of the important constituents expected in the ejecta from a Type II supernova. Line fluxes will be used to investigate the composition of the filament.  IUE observations of the omega filament in May 1987 show evidence of emission lines, but higher signal-to-noise is required to confirm the detections and give reliable flux measurements. We propose to use contiguous ESA/SERC and US1 shifts for long exposures in order to achieve optimal signal-to-noise.|Y
NSMJC|UV Emission-Lines in an "Edge-On" I-Front|Jason A.|Cardelli|Wisconsin|Stellar wind/interstellar cloud boundaries, particularly when viewed 'edge-on', provide a unique opportunity to study the physics of interstellar shocks and their effects on cloud structure. We propose to obtain low dispersion spectra at several positions across an ionization-shock boundary along the front edge of a compressed molecular complex within the the Gum nebula.  The molecular complex shows the effects of a strong outflow from the center of the nebula. The molecular cloud behind the ionization-shock boundary consists of a large number of overlapping opaque clumps with sizes ranging from 0.1 to 0.4 pc. Existing absorption line data toward one such clump locate 0.3 pc from the boundary indicates densities of the order of 104 cm^-3 or larger, but shocks no evidence of shocked gas. The winds and radiation from zeta Pup (O5 Iaf) and gamma2 Vel (WC8 + O9 I) provide the radiative and mechanical energy which has shaped this dynamical region.  We propose to observing across the upwind edge of the complex near the position of the absorption sight line at several spatial positions. We expect to be able to map the different zones along this dynamic boundary. We expect to see a transition from high ionization states in the hot starward layer fed by the stellar winds and UV radiation, to lower ionization states associated with a decelerated shock penetrating into the molecular cloud ahead of the I-front. In this latter region, we expect to find strong emission from fluoresced H2 which is being pumped by strong Ly-alpha emission from the I-front.  This region is ideal for this type of study because 1) the ionization-shock boundary is see 'edge-on', 2) the projected size of the IUE large aperture on the complex is of the order of 6-9x10^16 cm, 3) the cloud conditions immediately behind the boundary am well understood, and 4) the distances and characteristics of the sources supplying energy to the complex am well established.|Y
NSOLD|Stellar Populations in Early-Type Galaxies with Nuclear Star-Bursts|Linda L.|Dressel|Applied Research Corporation|Strong nuclear star-bursts are occurring in a significant fraction of SO and early-type spiral galaxies, particularly barred galaxies. I have used IRAS far infrared colors and fluxes to find galaxies with the strongest on-going bursts. I have taken U, B, R, I, and H-alpha images and long-slit spectra of these galaxies to find the most optically intense bursts and to characterize their stellar populations. Three of the galaxies have particularly deep Balmer absorption lines due to optically-dominant A star populations, and strong Balmer line emission powered by O and B stars. The spectra and images directly indicate the number Of A stars present in the bursts, but only limited and indirect information about the more massive stars can be obtained from this data. Short wavelength SWP spectra are needed to determine the mix of O and B main sequence stars, and possibly massive evolved stars, in the bursts. This mix will be determined chiefly from the absorption (and possibly emission) equivalent widths of the Si IV and C IV features at 1400 and 1550 Angstroms. The deduced numbers of O, B, and A main sequence stars can then be compared to models of continuous bursts with different initial mass functions, and to models of multiple bursts, to characterize this particular type of star-burst.|Y
NSOSS|Comparative UV Studies of New Satellite, Ring, & Asteroidal Targets|S. Alan|Stern|Southwest Research Institute|We propose that IUE significantly expand the first-order reconnaissance of planetary surface photometric properties in the mid-ultraviolet. We wish to accomplish this by measuring the mid-UV spectra of six targets consisting of a set of outer solar system satellites, the first Near Earth Asteroid (NEA) to be observed in the ultraviolet. and the first positionresolved UV studies of Saturn's rings. Four of the proposed targets (except the rings) have never been observed with any UV spectrometer.  The proposed observations will expand on our past observational work on outer solar system surfaces with IUE. The proposed LWP observervations  will complement existing groundbased and Voyager observations of these objects. and will serve as useful precursors to HST, Galileo. and Cassini studies. We will analyze these data to determine the shape and slope of the albedo curves below 3200 A. to place new constraints on the composition of these bodies (and in particular the nature of surface contaminants), and to make comparisons of their UV spectral properties to other planetary satellites and certain asteroids already studied by IUE.  Several of the observations we are proposing are time critical, in that unique observation geometry or other factors argue they be performed in 1992 or 1993.|Y
NVFSM|Time Variations in Young Planetary Nebulae of the Magellanic Clouds|Stephen P.|Maran|NASA/GSFC|We propose to obtain second-epoch IUE observations of three young, compact planetaries with high-mass (0.9 - 1.2 M(sun)) central stars. The central stars are extremely luminous, a consequence of high mass and young evolutionary state. They are thought to be still within one Paczinski fading time (20 to 300 yrs, for 0.9 to 1.2 M(sun) of the point at which they reached effective temperature 30,000 K while proceeding to the left along horizontal tracks in the HR diagram. Currently, the stars have effective temperatures of 100,000 K. The firstepoch IUE observations were made in May 1981. It is important to observe the nebular lines and the stellar continuum simultaneously; the stars are detectable only with IUE as they are overwhelmed by the nebular continuum in the visible, and are not resolvable (the nebulae are point sources at the distances of the Magellanic Clouds) from the nebulae. The targets are unique among known planetary nebulae thanks to the high mass and youthful evolutionary state of the central stars. The luminosities are accurately known, since the distances to the Clouds are accurately determined. Therefore, the observations will determine real changes in the nebular line fluxes and stellar luminosities, not just relative changes, and they will provide an important test of the theory of evolution of planetary nebula central stars. The results also can provide direct information on the response of a dense ionized medium to variations in the flux distribution of the exciting source.|Y
NVISS|Ultraviolet Observations of Nova Vul 1984 No.1 and No.2|Sumner G.|Starrfield|Arizona State|He propose to continue our observations of the two novae which are currently in outburst. Re have now obtained data on Nova Vul 1984 #1 since August 1984 and on Nova Vul 1984 *2 since December 1984. Ultraviolet spectroscopy of these novae provides unique data that has allowed us to determine the abundances of the intermediate mass elements for previous novae and will allow the same analyses for these novae. The galactic slow nova which is currently (November 1985) about mv ~ 12.5 continues to be observable with the IUE. Nova Vul 1984 #2 is currently about v ~ 10 and we have proposed that it is a new type of nova. Ultraviolet spectrophotometry appropriately spaced in time (about I observation per month) throughout their active period and decline will provide measurements of the shift of luminosity into the ultraviolet and absorption and emission line strengths. If we can observe these novae for a long enough time, we will be able to determine how such novae end their outburst. When combined with ground-based optical and infrared observations (which are being obtained as part of this project) the data will be used to model the outburst and thereby determine important physical characteristics of the nova such as the energy budget. chemical abundances of the critical CNONeM9 elements. mass ejection rates, line formation mechanisms. and dust condensation processes. In a companion proposal we request time for Target of Opportunity Data to be obtained on any other bright nova which outburst during the year.|Y
OBFBS|Continua and Extinction of OB Stars in Clusters|Blair D.|Savage|Wisconsin|Eight IUE shifts are requested to obtain low resolution SWP and LWR spectra of B stars in the open clusters h& Chi Per NGC 3293, and Trumpler 14. Both main sequence and evolved B stars will be observed and analyzed in combination with existing data on O stars and B supergiants in these clusters. Reliable dereddened energy distributions for the O and luminous B stars can only be obtained once the local UV extinction has been determined from observations of the main sequence B stars whose continuous energy distributions are well understood. The intrinsic continua of the O stars and bright giant and supergiant B stars in the clusters will furnish valuable information on the applicability of currently available model atmospheres to such objects. In addition to this goal, the line spectra of the main sequence B stars will be valuable in determining the origin of the recently discovered UV spectral anomalies observed in similar stars in NGC 6231.|Y
OBFGS|Rotational Broadening of Photospheric Lines in Main-Sequence B Stars|George|Sonneborn|CSC|Discrepancies in spectral line widths between UV and visual wavelength regions occur in Be stars. The UV lines are narrower than expected, implying a lower projected rotational velocity (V sin i). one interpretation suggests that the narrower UV lines originate in the hotter, more slowly rotating (i.e. polar) regions of a rapidly rotating star. If so, the line width discrepancy seen in Be stars should occur in rapidly rotating non-emission B stars as well. In a systematic survey of non-emission main-sequence B stars, we propose to use archival IUE data and obtain new high-dispersion IUE spectra to study rotational broadening of UV photospheric lines. The data are needed to: (1) determine the variation in UV photospheric line widths as a function of V sin i and spectral type, and (2) provide a homogeneous set of UV line profiles for comparison with existing visual spectra of the same stars and with theoretical line profile calculations. The results of this study, when compared with UV and visual spectra of Be stars, will show whether or not rapid rotation alone, rather than the Be phenomenon, is the primary cause of the line-width discrepancy in Be stars. Understanding this discrepancy is crucial to theoretical modeling of rotation in early-type stars and may provide a means of determining equatorial velocities and inclination angles.|Y
OBFTS|Stellar Winds in B and Be Stars|Theodore|Snow|University of Colorado|It is proposed to use IUE data to obtain high-resolution, farultraviolet spectra of a number of B and Be stars of spectral types BO through 86 to determine the dependence of winds on stellar parameters in the region of the H-R diagram where winds are only marginally present, and to explore the relationship between B and Be stars, particularly with regard to wind properties. By determining which stars have winds and which do not in this borderline region of the H-R diagram, it may be possible to learn which stellar characteristics cause or influence the wind, which in turn may have important implications for their origin in these and more luminous hot stars. By comparing winds in B and Be stars, it may be possible to isolate the factors that make some stars Be and others not. The proposal requests observations of relatively bright objects, all of which can be observed during NASA shift 2.|Y
OBGGS|Rotational Broadening of Ultraviolet Photospheric Lines in Later-Type B Stars|George|Sonneborn|CSC|Discrepancies in spectral line widths between UV and visual wavelength regions occur in some early-type stars with large Vsin i. The UV lines are up to a factor of two narrower than expected from visual lines, implying a lower projected rotational velocity. One interpretation suggests that the narrower UV lines originate in the hotter, more slowly rotating (i.e. polar) regions of a rapidly rotating star. If so, the line width discrepancy seen in Be stars should occur in non-emission B stars as well. Our recent IUE observations of early-type B stars show that this effect is present in non-emission stars but the UV lines are only 10-20% narrower than their visual counterparts. This result has two important implications: (1) The larger effect seen in some Be stars may be related to the Be phenomenon, and (2) The fact that there is a wavelength dependence to spectral line widths in rapidly rotating, non-emission B stars may prove to be the basis of a method to determine inclination angles and equatorial velocities.  The observations of B2-B3 stars referred to above were obtained in August 1983 as part of our program to study this effect. In light of these results we now propose to extend that work to later types and complete the B star main sequence. The data are needed to determine the variation in UV photospheric line widths as a function of v sin i and spectral type, and to provide a homogeneous set of UV line profiles for comparison with our high-resolution visual spectra of the same stars. The stars we will study are all rotational velocity standard stars defined by Slettebak et al. (1975).|Y
OBGNW|Ultraviolet Spectral Morphology of the O Stars|Nolan R.|Walborn|NASA/GSFC|We propose to utilize the unprecedented sample of uniform, high-quality UV stellar spectra provided by the IUE archives, to provide a comprehensive overview of the behavior of both photospheric and stellar wind spectral features in the 1200-1900 A region among the O-type stars. In particular, the archives high-dispersion, SWP images for nearly 200 different O stars, of which we have already selected 120 with previous accurate optical classifications by N.R.W. These UV data show strong systematic trends, smoothly correlated with the optical spectral types, among the majority of normal stars, and striking anomalies in the peculiar objects by contrast, which have not yet been fully appreciated even by specialists in this field. There is a strong implication that the stellar winds are in fact governed by the fundamental physical parameters of the stars. We request support for the publication of three journal papers discussing the results of most immediate astrophysical significance, and for the preparation of an atlas illustrating this full spectral range for numerous representative objects. We believe on the basis of our experience as well as discussions with a number of colleagues, that this work will provide valuable orientation for many future UV investigations, both observational and theoretical, of the O type stars.|Y
OBGRK|OB Association Contamination in Spectra of SN Evans 1983 in M 83|Robert P.|Kirshner|Michigan|The Type I SN Evans 1983 in M 83 has been extensively observed in low esolution with IUE. This Supernova was discovered about 10 days before its optical maximum and has been followed regularly with IUE from the discovery until it became impractical to observe it further. The results show that the light-curve develops in the UV much faster then in the Visual. Unfortunately, the spectrum of an OB-association in M 83 is fully mixed into the Supernova spectrum, It is impossible to disentangle the two spectra.  We want to obtain a spectrum of the OB-association when the SN has disappeared completely.  We want to make a short wavelength 16 hr. exposure of the position of the SN. The long wavelength part of the spectrum is going to be observed in an additional shift requested from the ESA/SERC allocation committee.|Y
OBHCG|Winds of Hot Stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud|Catharine D.|Garmany|Colorado|We propose extending the study of stellar winds from hot stars to include objects in the SMC. Understanding mass loss is vital for comparative studies of stellar evolution, the interstellar medium and its reddening law. Why, compared to the LMC, does the SMC have such a 9=11 number of WR stars? Why are the H II regions and dark nebulae of the SMC so much smaller than in the LMC? The much lower metallicity of the SMC, compared to the galaxy, provides a real test for the line radiation pressure theory of stellar winds. A study of O-stars in the LMC (Garmany and Conti, submitted) suggests that the mass loss rates may be higher than expected. Only about 4 appropriate SMC stars have been observed with IUE and we wish to extend this sample and compare the wind terminal velocities and mass loss rates with galactic and LMC counterparts.|Y
OBHDB|IUE Spectrophotometric Census of the Orion OBI Association B Stars|Douglas N.|Brown|Washington|This program is designed to study, using low dispersion IUE spectra, the prevalence of the silicon abundance anomaly among the B stars of the Orion OB 1 association, a sample of fundamental importance in the study of the role of nonthermal processes in early-type stellar structure and evolution. The SWP images will be used spectrophotometrically to measure the strength of the broad continuum absorption feature at 1400 A, which is implicated as an autoionization feature of Si II and which has decisive advantages over optical spectral or photometric techniques for identifying Si stars. The primary goal of the proposed observations is to isolate unambiguously the Orion OB 1 silicon stars. The improved specification of this sample will contribute directly to the interpretation of existing magnetic and rotational surveys of the Orion stars. A secondary goal is to improve the observational determination of the minimum time required for development of the silicon anomaly. Without a firm value for this number, the most important constraint on the radiative diffusion model is lacking. In addition, the comparison of the results of this proposed observation will be to determine the character of the correlation between the optical 5200 feature and the silicon abundance and/or magnetic field strength. That calibration will allow the optical continuum feature to be used in a statistically dependable fashion in the future.|Y

OBHPM|Stellar Winds in the Hot Stars of Nearby Galaxies|Philip L.|Massey|Aura|We are proposing to complete a study begun last year to extend our knowledge of stellar winds to the hot stars in M31 and M33 identified by optical photometry and spectroscopy. There are about a dozen O stars in these galaxies bright enough to be observed with IUE in low dispersion mode; we know now that a 12 to 15 hour integration yields a spectrum with sufficiently good signal to noise to allow direct comparisons of stellar wind properties of these stars to be made with their galactic counterparts. LWP exposures for a few of these stars will then also allow us to make tentative identifications of the UV extinction laws in these galaxies.|Y
OBHSS|Luminous Early-Type Emission Line Supergiants in the Galaxy & Comparison with Magellanic Cloud Counterparts|Steven|Shore|STScI|This project will study a sample of galactic extreme early-type emission line supergiants using low dispersion SWP and LWP spectra. The purpose is a direct comparison between the galactic and Magellanic Cloud supergiants which constitute probable members of the class of luminous blue variables also known as Hubble-Sandage variables - the most massive members of the galaxian population. Among the most Important products will be the determination of physical parameters (mass, radius, and temperature), details of the wind structures and mass loss rates, and the determination of the CNO abundances. The study, when combined with our earlier results for the LMC and SMC, will provide useful constraints on the evolution of massive stars subsequent to the main sequence stage, especially the effects of turbulent mixing of nitrogen.|Y
OBIBB|Spectrophotometry of H-Alpha Emission-Line Stars in the LMC|Bruce|Bohannan|Colorado - CASA|As part of a study of the bright emission-line stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud, ultraviolet spectrophotometry from IUE will be combined with narrow-band visible photometry to measure effective temperatures and gravities of the most pathological stars in the sample through comparison of observed fluxes with Kurucz model atmospheres. IUE spectrophotometry is required because the spectra of early-type emission-line stars are often so complex that visible light absorption-line strengths can be a potentially misleading indicator of effective temperature. Indeed, some of these stars have such strong emission-lines from their dense, extended atmospheres that they have no lines arising from the photosphere. The overall goal of this research is to locate the sample of LMC emission-line stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram to gain an understanding of the paths that massive stars take in evolving from main sequence 0-type stars to Wolf-Rayet stars.|Y
OBICG|Continuum Studies of Magellanic Cloud O Stars|Catharine D.|Garmany|Colorado - JILA|Although the absorption line spectra of early type stars are quite well understood, there are significant problems associated with their continuous energy distributions. In contrast to model predictions, Massa and Savage (1985) found that none of the O-type stars they studied have UV colors any bluer than an unreddened BOV star. In what may be a related manifestation of this UV color degeneracy, Conti et al. (1986) have observed no distinction in the intrinsic UBV colors of early and late O-stars in the Magellanic Clouds. We propose to study the UV continua of main sequence and giant O-stars in the Magellanic Clouds, where low reddening eliminates the major problem associated with similar studies of Galactic O-stars. In addition, the lower metallicity in the Clouds will provide an important contrast with the Galaxy. We intend to compare the dependence of the energy distribution on spectral type for a variety of lightly reddened O-stars, identified spectroscopically in a related program.  This proposal complements a similar proposal by Fitzpatarick and Massa to study 8 supergiants in the LMC.|Y
OBIDB|IUE Spectrophotometric Cencus of Orion OB1 Association B Stars, II|Douglas N.|Brown|Washington|This program is designed to study, using low dispersion IUE spectra, the prevalence of the silicon abundance anomaly among the B stars of the Orion OB1 association, a sample of fundamental importance in the study of the role of nonthermal processes in early-type stellar structure and evolution.

That calibration will allow the optical continuum feature to be used in a statistically dependable fashion in the future. Sufficient shifts were allocated during the Eighth Episode to observe roughly half the program stars. The current proposal is for the completion of the statistical sample.|Y
OBIDF|Stellar Winds From Rapidly Rotating Hot Stars|David B.|Friend|Wisconsin|We propose to use archival high dispersion IUE spectra to measure the terminal velocities (and mass loss rates) of hot stars which are known to be rapid rotators. An improved radiation-driven stellar wind model, which is based on the CAK model but which includes rotation and the uniform disk approximation for the source of radiation, predicts that the terminal velocity should decrease with increasing rotational velocity. The most rapidly rotating O and B stars have not had their terminal velocities measured before, since most of these stars have winds which are only marginally strong enough to measure with IUE. We have selected stars which should have strong enough winds that their terminal velocities should be reliably determined by the short wavelength edge of the P Cygni profiles of the C IV resonance doublet.  The wind model described above also predicts that the mass loss rate should increase with increasing rotational velocity. We also plan to use a profile-fitting technique to estimate the mass loss rates for these stars, first with a spherically symmetric wind model for the computation of the line profile, but eventually with an axially symmetric model which we are developing. With measurements of terminal velocities and mass loss rates in the most rapidly rotating hot stars, we will be able to quantitatively test our model for the winds from these stars.|Y
OBIEB|The Effects of Metallicity on Stellar Winds|Erika|Bohm-Vitense|Washington|A fundamental prediction of line driven wind theory is that the mass loss rate of hot stars should scale with the metallicity. Initial studies with the IUE, however, have found that the mass loss rates in the metal deficient Magellanic Clouds are similar to the galactic rates. We propose to test this prediction with low resolution observations of galactic O and B stars with different abundances. The target stars are associated with high and low abundance H II regions. The metallicity range is quite large and the stars are all expected to show unsaturated P Cygni profiles. A mass loss rate difference as predicted by radiatively driven wind theory will be readily detectable if present. If we find no dependence on z then a serious difficulty with radiatively wind theory will have to be addressed.|Y
OBIEF|Energy Distributions of LMC OB Supergiants|Edward L.|Fitzpatrick|Colorado - JILA|We propose to obtain new (~30 stars) and Archival (~20 stars) IUE observations for a study of the energy distributions of O and B supergiants in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The program stars include O4-A0 Ia supergiants for which new spectral classification data and Stromgren photometry have been obtained. We will compare the UV-tovisual continua with the predictions of plane parallel, LTE models of the type published by Kurucz (1979). The published Kurucz grid does not extend to low enough gravities to provide a valid comparison between theory and observations for the supergiants. Therefore, we propose to extend the calculations of Kurucz (1979) to lower gravities. These new models will allow us to determine whether the assumptions of plane parallel geometry and LTE are valid for the continuum forming regions of early type supergiant atmospheres. Preliminary results suggest that such low gravity models may give very good agreement with observed supergiant continuum shapes, at least for the B-types.|Y
OBJEF|Energy Distributions of B Supergiants in the Small Magellanic Cloud|Edward L.|Fitzpatrick|Colorado - JILA|We are requesting 6 IUE observing shifts to obtain low-dispersion, long- and short-wavelength spectra of 20 B-type supergiants in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), for a study of the intrinsic continua shapes of these-stars. The target list contains some of the most lightly reddened, most luminous, "normal" SMC B supergiants. The energy distributions of these SMC stars can be very accurately determined due to the very light interstellar reddening. The continua will be compared with the predictions of one-tenth solar abundance low-gravity model atmosphere calculations to derive estimates of the effective temperatures and gravities. These models will be calculated using the model atmosphere program of Kurucz. The feasibility of such calculations has been demonstrated in our study of Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) supergiant continua. The results of this proposed SMC study will be combined with the LMC results and with the known properties of Milky Way supergiants in a comparative study of luminous B stars in the three galaxies, which span a range of a factor of ten in metallicity.|Y
OBKCG|Magellanic Cloud OB Associations|Catharine D.|Garmany|Colorado - CASA|We are proposing to obtain continuum fluxes of normal, well-classified OB stars in associations on the LMC and SMC. The intrinsic flux distributions of the O stars can be used to test wind-blanketed, non-LTE models being constructed at JILA. The UV data will be combined with optical spectrophotometry already obtained at CTIO, but the UV fluxes are crucial to the success of this program given the high temperatures of these stars. An accurate assessment of these models is needed if we are to use them to predict the ionizing radiation as a function of effective temperatures, as the flux distribution of O stars are poorly approximated as black-bodies, particularly in the far-UV where most of the flux is found. The importance of this kind of study is clear when we recall that our source of information about the massive star content and recent star formation history of galaxies is primarily based upon H-alpha emission measures.|Y
OBKDB|IUE Spectrophotometric Census of Ori OB1 Association B Stars, III|Douglas N.|Brown|Washington|This program is designed to complete an ongoing survey, using low dispersion IUE spectra. of the prevalence of the silicon abundance anomaly among the B-stars of the Orion OB1 association. These stars comprise a sample of fundamental importance in the study of the role of nonthermal processes in early-type stellar structure and evolution. The SWP images will be used spectrophotometrically to measure the strength of the broad continuum absorption feature at 1400 k. which has been linked to an autoionization feature of Si II and which has decisive advantages over optical spectrographic or photometric techniques for identifying silicon stars. The primary goal of the proposed observations is to isolate unambigiiously the Orion OB1 silicon stars. The improved specification of this sample will contribute directly to the interpretation of existing magnetic and rotational surveys of the Orion stars. A secondary goal is to improve the observational determination of the timescale for development of the silicon anomaly. An empirical characterization of this process would provide the most important constraint on the radiative diffusion model. An additional result of this survey will be to determine the character of the correlation between the optical 5200 A feature and the silicon abundance and/or magnetic field strength. That calibration may allow the optical continuum feature to be used in a statistically dependable fashion in the future. Sufficient shifts were allocated during the Eighth and Ninth Episodes to observe roughly two-thirds of the program stars. Three previously unrecognized silicon stars. all apparently weakly overabundant, were discovered in the process. The current proposal is for the completion of the statistical sample.|Y
OBKEB|UV Continua of Cluster OB Stars in the Wing of the SMC|Erika|Bohm-Vitense|Washington|Many investigators have found that the UV color temperatures of galactic O stars are generally well below the effective temperatures of the stars as inferred from optical line spectra and Zanstra colors. The difference is so severe that even the earliest O stars have UV continua, normalized at V, no brighter than early B main sequence stars.  The effects of two possible explanations for the relatively cool continua, wind blanketing and non-LTE line blanketing, should be dependent on the stellar metal content. In particular, the winds of early-type stars with lower metallicity should be weaker and less effective at scattering radiation back onto the photosphere. The net effect should be reduced surface heating and consequently steeper UV continua than stars of galactic abundance.  We propose to measure the UV continua of main sequence O and B stars in two lightly reddened clusters in the extreme wing of the SMC. Our observations will allow a precise test of these theories. With a much lower metallicity in the SMC compared to the Galaxy, line- and wind blanketing effects should be greatly reduced. If neither of these mechanisms are shaping the UV continua, the color temperatures of the O stars should be as cool as the B stars. Restricting our target stars to a single lightly reddened association will limit the uncertainties in dereddening the spectra.|Y
OBKEF|Extinction and Continua of Luminous B Stars in NGC 4755|Edward L.|Fitzpatrick|Princeton|Eight IUE observing shifts are requested to obtain low-dispersion SWP and LWP spectra of main-sequence and evolved B-type stars in the Milky Way cluster NGC4755 (the "Jewel Box"). The main sequence stars will be used to derive the wavelength dependence of the ultraviolet interstellar extinction affecting the cluster. The resulting extinction curve will be used to deredden the continua of the evolved B stars. These intrinsic continua will be combined with similarly derived continua for B giants and supergiants in several other clusters in a study of the energy distributions of luminous B stars in the Milky Way. The energy distributions will be compared with model atmosphere calculations to estimate the effective temperatures and surface gravities of the stars. The known distance moduli of the clusters then allow the stellar masses and luminosities to be derived. These data are required to test the predictions of stellar evolution calculations and to fully understand the evolutionary status of the B supergiants.|Y
OBLCG|B Supergiants in the Large Magellanic Cloud|Catharine D.|Garmany|Colorado - CASA|We are proposing an intensive observing program to obtain low-dispersion IUE spectra for a complete set of 0and B-type supergiants in the Large Magellanic cloud. These data will be used to answer a variety of questions: how can blue supergiants in the pre- and post-red supergiant phase be distinguished? What are their basic physical parameters of temperature, gravity, abundance anomalies and mass loss? What are the regional variations in the LMC extinction law? There is dearly much that we do not understand about the evolution of massive stars, and the LMC provides an excellent location for study. The census of blue supergiants is very complete, and optical studies of these stars provides an important stepping stone for our UV work.|Y
OBLDB|IUE Spectrophotometric Census of Scorpius OB2 Association B-Stars|Douglas N.|Brown|Washington|This program is designed to survey, using low dispersion IUE spectra, the prevalence of the silicon abundance anomaly among the B stars of the Scorpius OB2 association, a sample of great importance in the study of the role of nonthermal processes in early-type stellar structure and evolution. The SWP images will be used spectrophotometrically to measure the strength of the broad continuum absorption feature at 1400 A, which has been linked to an autoionization feature of Si II and which has decisive advantages over optical spectrographic or photometric techniques for identifying Si stars. The primary goal of the proposed observations is to isolate unambiguously the Scorpius OB2 silicon stars. The improved specification of this sample will contribute directly to the interpretation of existing magnetic and rotational surveys of the Scorpius-Centaurus Association stars. The IUE spectrophotometry will allow accurate determination of effective temperatures and surface gravities for the Sco OB2 stars. Most importantly, the comparison of the sample of silicon stars in Sco OB2 with those identified by the same technique in an earlier census of Orion OB1 will allow us to determine whether the population statistics of magnetic stars in young associations are similar in different associations of the same age.|Y
OBLDM|The UV Extinction Properties of Carina Nebular Dust|Derck L.|Massa|ARC|We are requesting 1 US1 and 1 US2 shifts to obtain low dispersion spectra of OB stars in the Carina Nebular cluster Tr 16. combining the IUE measurements with recently published IR photometry of the cluster stars, will enable us to construct IR through Uv extinction curves. We argue that extinction curves from this region are ideal for testing the important relationship between R^-1 and Uv curve shape recently uncovered by Cardelli, Clayton and Mathis.|Y
OBLIH|Coordinated UV and H-Alpha Observations of Wind Variability in O Stars|Ian D.|Howarth|Colorado - JILA|We propose to carry out intensive IUE high resolution observations of selected O stars in order to study migrating optical depth enhancements (ODEs) in the resonance line P Cygni profiles. These data will be used to investigate the relationship of the ODEs to 'narrow absorption features', to model the acceleration and column densities of the ODEs, and to study the dependence of ODE characteristics on photospheric quantities, especially ve. sin(i). The ultraviolet data will be combined with coordinated multisite H-alpha spectroscopy to resolve the controversy surrounding the causative mechanism of the ODEs (and narrow absorption features) by revealing their evolution from low velocity through to the terminal velocity of the flow.  Our recent surveys of P Cygni resonance line profiles in UV spectra have shown that narrow absorption features at ~ 0.8v*. are a universal feature of O star winds (Prinja & Howarth 1986; Howarth & Prinja 1989a). Recent intensive studies on appropriate timescales demonstrate that the narrow absorption features are merely an observationally conspicuous manifestation of variability which actually occurs across most of the profile (Prinja, Howarth, & Henrichs 1987; Prinja & Howarth 1988). This variability takes the form of optical depth enhancements which first become evident as broad (~ 0.3v*), relatively shallow features at ~ 0.5v*, and which then migrate towards higher velocities while becoming narrower. (We use v. to indicate the maximum velocity seen in absorption in the spectrum). Tentative evidence exists to suggest that the recurrence and dissipation timescales increase with decreasing ve sin(i) (Prinja 1988); if confirmed, this would provide an important constraint on the origin of the ODEs.  Our study will substantially expand the meagre database of time resolved UV O star studies, and permit a detailed investigation of the dependence of ODE characteristics on ve sin(i). Moreover, by using coordinated multisite H-alpha spectroscopy, we expect to be able to resolve the question of whether ODEs can be 'tracked' back to the photosphere, and thereby distinguish between models for the ODEs based on mass-conserving entities and those based on radiative instabilities in the flow.|Y
OBLJN|UV and Optical Covariability of O Star Winds|Joy|Nichols-Bohlin|CSC|One of the ununderstood, but fundamental properties of early-type star winds is their rapid variability, as often seen in the UV P Cygni lines. As a result from our previous UV/optical campaigns on O stars we have found a significant coincidence between the intermittent occurrence of "discrete absorption components" in UV resonance lines and sudden changes in photospheric lines for at least one star. Although the physics of this covariability is not yet clear, the impact on stellar wind theories will be major if this result can be demonstrated to be valid for other stars as well. In particular, most current investigators tend to believe that the occurrence of variable discrete components is an intrinsic property of a supersonic wind flow, whereas our observations suggest that their origin is rather connected with the (subsonic) atmosphere of the star.  The prime goal of this proposal is therefore to closely investigate for a few well-selected O stars this recently discovered correlation between wind and photospheric activity. By means of simultaneous UV and optical study we hope to establish the correlation for more stars than the one or possibly two found so far. This will enable us to get more insight in stellar wind structure of O stars, in particular the cause of the atmospheric/wind covariablity. The proposed investigation is the next logical step to analyze the variable wind properties of early-type stars.|Y
OBLPM|The Stellar Winds of the Very Early O-type Stars in NGC 346, the Youngest Cluster in the SMC|Philip L.|Massey|KPN|Although IUE has allowed great progress to be made in the study of stellar winds from hot, luminous stars, the effect that metallicity has on mass-loss rates and stellar wind laws is not understood. Garmany and Fitzpatrick found that while the stellar wind lines were weak in SMC O-type stars, they were not weak enough: the inferred mass-loss rates appear to actually be about the same or slightly higher compared to their Galactic counterparts. However, their study was restricted to mid-to-late O-type stars, as earlier ones had not yet been discovered. Recent optical work has identified over a dozen early-to-mid O stars in NGC 346, the youngest and most heavily populated OB association in the SMC. It is these stars which we would expect to have the strongest stellar winds, and I am proposing to obtain IUE low-dispersion data on these stars to extend such studies to the earliest types.|Y
OBMCG|B Supergiants in the Large Magellanic Cloud|Catharine D.|Garmany|Colorado - CASA|We are proposing an intensive observing program to obtain low-dispersion IUE spectra for a complete set of O-  and B-type supergiants in the Large Magellanic cloud.

What are their basic physical parameters of temperature, gravity, abundance anomalies and mass loss? What are the regional variations in the LMC extinction law? There is clearly much that we do not understand about the evolution of massive stars, and the LMC provides an excellent location for study. The census of blue supergiants is very complete, and optical studies of these stars provides an important stepping stone for our UV work.|Y
OBMJN|UV and Optical Covariability of O Star Winds|Joy|Nichols-Bohlin|CSC - Astronomy Programs|One of the unexplained, but fundamental properties of early-type stellar winds is their rapid variability, as often seen in the UV P Cygni lines. As a result of our worldwide UV/optical campaign on two O stars last year, we have found a very significant coincidence between the behavior in the UV resonance lines and sudden changes in the He 114686 line for at least one star. Although the physics of this covariability is not yet clear, rotation must play a major role, and the impact on stellar wind theories will be substantial if this result can be demonstrated to be valid for other stars as well. In particular, most current theoretical investigators tend to believe that the occurrence of wind variability is an intrinsic property of a supersonic wind flow, whereas our observations suggest that their origin is connected with the behavior of the (subsonic) atmosphere of the star.  The prime goal of this proposal is therefore to closely investigate for a few additional, wellselected O stars this recently discovered correlation between wind and photospheric activity. By means of simultaneous UV and optical study we hope to establish the correlation for more stars than the one or possibly two found so far, enabling us to get insight in the cause of this covariablity. The proposed investigation is a further step in the analysis of the variable wind properties of early-type stars.|Y
OBMMC|Coordinated UV and X-Ray Monitoring of O Star Winds II|Michael F.|Corcoran|NASA/GSFC|We propose to obtain high dispersion short wavelength observations of 4 O stars in a 2degree field of the Sco OB1 association. These observations should be made simultaneously/contemporaneously with observations of the region by ROSAT to be obtained during 10 ksec of allocated ROSAT pointed observations. Such coordinated UV/X-ray coverage will allow us to probe the relationship between the stellar wind and the location/characteristics of the hot gas giving rise to the X-ray flux from these stars.|Y
OBMTS|IUE Observations of a New Outburst Phase in P Cygni|Theodore P.|Snow|Colorado - CASA|We propose to monitor the well-known luminous blue variable star P Cygni for changes in its ultraviolet spectrum which may occur as the star undergoes an outburst phase as observed in the optical emission lines. This star belongs to a class of very massive, hot stars which are unstable against radiation pressure, causing them to have highly variable rates of mass loss. optical spectroscopy in late January 1990 revealed enhanced Balmer emission lines, indicating that P Cygni had just entered a new phase of enhanced mass loss. It is important to observe and analyze ultraviolet stellar wind signatures such as C IV (1550A), N V (1240A), Mg II (2800A), and Si IV (1400A). We propose to do so at approximately 2-week intervals over the months of the coming year when the star is accessible to IUE. The exposure times are 40 min (SWP, high dispersion) and 5 min (LWP, high dispersion), so two hours at each observing opportunity is sufficient. Because we are asking for many short observations, which will be very routine in nature, we ask that service observations be provided.|Y
OBNJN|UV and Optical Covariability of O Star Winds|Joy|Nichols-Bohlin|CSC - Astronomy Programs|The origin of the widely observed wind variability in early-type stars is unknown. In our search for a possible connection between photospheric and wind variability, we found during last year's UV/optical campaign on two O stars that changes in high-velocity absorption edge in the UV resonance lines are strongly correlated with equivalent width changes in the He II 4686 line at low velocity. In one case a periodicity was identified. We also found that the strength of the Discrete Absorption Components (DACs) at intermediate velocity in the UV P Cygni lines correlates with the velocity changes in the highvelocity absorption edge. This behavior suggests that the variability of the wind, including its DAC's, originates in a region close to the underlying photosphere and that both low- and high-velocity material are present near the stellar surface. Our observations support a shocked-wind model in which rotation plays an important role. Due to lack of full simultaneous coverage we could not establish a suspected relationship between the (non-radially pulsating) deep photosphere and the wind variability.  The prime goal of this proposal is therefore to investigate a few O stars similar to the two studied last year, with a much better optical coverage both in time and wavelength space, further studying the correlation between wind and (near-) photospheric activity. The proposed investigation is an essential step in the understanding of this fundamental property of early-tvpe stars.|Y
OBODG|Colliding Winds and Tomography of O-Type Binaries|Douglas R.|Gies|Georgia State University|We propose to obtain IUE high dispersion SWP spectra of six 0-type binary systems to supplement the orbital phase coverage of existing archival spectra. We will analyze the orbital phase related variations in the P Cygni stellar wind lines to search for evidence of colliding winds in this sample of binaries with components of nearly equal luminosity. We will also use a Doppler tomography algorithm to re-construct the individual component photospheric spectra to determine spectral types, luminosity classes, UV magnitude difference, and projected rotational velocities, and to search for evidence of abundance anomalies. The results will yield important new constraints on the evolutionary status and mass loss properties of these systems.|Y

OCODM|A High Dispersion Survey of B Supergiants in Open Clusters|Derck L.|Massa|Applied Research Corporation|We are requesting 4 US1 shifts to obtain high-dispersion spectra of B supergiants in open clusters. These supergiants form homogeneous samples with similar initial compositions and ages, and are the only supergiants with well determined luminosities. As a result, these stars provide ideal laboratories for studying the dependence of UV photospheric features on luminosities (calibration of spectroscopic parallax), the dependence of mass loss rates on luminosity, the progression of recently discovered UV photospheric line asymmetries on luminosity and, in cases where the clusters have similar ages, differences in the chemical compositions of the cluster stars through wind line analysis. In addition, these spectra will enhance the IUE archives by providing the fundamental data needed for future applications such as comparisons to extragalactic supergiants, and population synthesis studies.|Y
OCPWL|The UV-Bright Stars of Omega Centauri|Wayne B.|Landsman|Hughes - STX|During the first flight of the ASTRO observatory in 1990 December, we obtained a 1620 A image of the globular cluster Omega Centauri using the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UIT). This image revealed that Omega Cen contained numerous "UV-bright" stars. We subsequently obtained IUE discretionary time to study two UV-bright stars found within 2' of the center of Omega Cen. We found that these stars were insufficiently luminous to be postAGB stars, and suggested that they could be evolved hot horizontal branch stars or postearly AGB stars.  We now propose to obtain IUE low-dispersion spectra of four additional UV-bright stars in Omega Cen. Three of the stars (ROA 5342, ROA 5857, and Dickens 3873) are known from comparison of UIT and ground-based photometry to be quite hot (>> 20000 K) although such broad-band photometry can only set a lower limit on their effective temperature. We will use the IUE spectra to determine the effective temperature and luminosity of these stars, in order to help determine their evolutionary status. Our results will yield insights concerning the the late evolution of low mass stars, and may provide clues to the origin of the ultraviolet light in elliptical galaxies.|Y
OCRWL|The UV-Bright Stars of Omega Centauri|Wayne B.|Landsman|Hughes - STX|During the first flight of the ASTRO observatory in 1990 December, we obtained a 1620 A image of the globular cluster Omega Centauri using the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UIT). This image revealed that Omega Cen contains a rich population of "UV-bright" stars. We have previously obtained IUE spectra of six UV-bright stars discovered on the UIT image and have found a variety of spectra probably indicative of different evolutionary states. Two stars (ROA 5342 and Dk 3873) have sdO spectra indicative of very high temperatures, while the two core UV-bright stars have spectra similar to main-sequence B stars. Only one star (ROA 3596) appears have the luminosity expected of a classical post-AGB star.  We now propose to obtain IUE low-dispersion spectra of four additional UV bright stars in Omega Cen. Three of the stars (UIT-151, UIT-1435 and Dickens 3089) are known from comparison of UIT and ground-based photometry to be quite hot (>> 20000 K) although such broad-band photometry can only set a lower limit on their effective temperature. We will use the IUE spectra to determine the effective temperature and luminosity of these stars, in order to help determine their evolutionary status. Our combined survey of 11 UV-bright stars in a single cluster should yield insights concerning the late evolution of low mass stars, and may provide clues to the origin of the ultraviolet light in elliptical galaxies.|Y

OPONE|Evolutionary Studies in Open Clusters|Nancy Remage|Evans|York University - CRESS|This study focuses on the upper main sequence of two Pleiades age open clusters, NGC 2287 and NGC 3532. In these clusters, stars with late B and early A spectral types are slightly evolved but still within the main sequence band. Because of the variety of stellar phenomena in this range, these clusters are good laboratories to study the effects of rotation and possible unusual reddening laws, as well as the relation between normal stars and chemically peculiar stars, spectrum variables, and binaries. Specifically, IUE low resolution spectra will provide very accurate temperatures for stars in this spectral range. These temperatures will be combined with luminosity measurements (V in the visual range, or an approximate bolometric magnitude from ultraviolet fluxes). The resulting HR diagram will be an improved diagnostic of the relation between various classes of stars because of the improved temperature discrimination as well is more nearly bolometric magnitudes. Ultimately the width of the main sequence band in such clusters is an indicator of the quantity of convective overshoot in evolutionary models, which is currently a. very important uncertainty in modeling.|Y
OPOTM|Bolometric Corrections of Ap(Si) Stars in Open Clusters using Low Dispersion IUE Spectroscop|Thomas|Meylan|CSC - IUE Observatory|Bolometric corrections for Ap(Si) (silicon enhanced) stars in open star clusters will be determined using low dispersion IUE ultraviolet spectroscopy. Methods described by North (1981) and Lanz (1984) will be applied to Ap(Si) stars and normal A stars, as classified by Abt and collaborators in a series of papers covering several open clusters. Applying the methods to two types of stars in the same cluster will provide a differential determination of the bolometric corrections between the stars examined. It can also be assumed that the extinction corrections will be very similar for both classes of stars. However, the extinction corrections for each star will be carefully examined using the extinction curves determined by Fitzpatrick and Massa (1988). In addition, special customized model atmospheres will be computed using ATLAS9 by Kurucz in which the chemical peculiarities of the Ap atmospheres are included. These models will provide more realistic theoretical determinations of the flux distributions and bolometric corrections for Ap stars to be used in comparisons with the observed spectra.|Y
OSHCG|Short-Term Variations in Stellar Winds of Luminous Early-Tpye Stars|Catharine D.|Garmany|Colorado|The principal goal of the proposed observations is a further investigation of time dependent behavior of stellar winds of luminous early-type stars. It concerns variable, transient, high-velocity absorption components in the P Cygni profiles (Si IV, C IV and N V) of these stars, indicative for a varying part of the stellar wind. A statistical survey has shown that this phenomenon is present in about 50% of all stars brighter than Mbol ~= -7. Previous extensive work on about 8 stars, based on all available high-resolution IUE spectra including those obtained in IUE time previously allocated to us, strongly suggests that: (1) the timescale for the narrow absorption lines to accelerate from low to high velocity is of the order of half a day, (2) the decay of the strength of the lines takes place in about a week, and (3) the frequency of starting a new episode may range from once every few hours to every day or week, varying for a particular star as well as from star to star.  A recent search through archive data has revealed quite a number of stars with strongly variable profiles. We propose to carry out a frequent monitoring of a few of them which are currently in an active state.  The new data are needed (1) to pin down timescales for formation, development and decay of the narrow lines and to measure their properties (i.e., velocity and column density), (2) to derive ionization-structure changes during these episodes, and (3) hopefully to discriminate between the many different models which exist for this evidently fundamental property of luminous stars.|Y
OSJCG|Massive Stars in the Magellanic Clouds|Catharine D.|Garmany|Colorado - CASA|The role that stellar winds from massive stars play in our own galaxy is well understood, and the theory behind these winds has been developed in detail. We are only starting to explore stellar wind mass loss in nearby galaxies. Both theory and observation support the idea that the strength of the winds are a function of metallicity as well as luminosity, and this dependence must be understood before stellar models can be applied to other galaxies. The Magellanic Cloud O stars are ideal for this comparison: the CNO elements, which provide about half of the wind driving force, are down by factors of 3 and 10 in the LMC and SMC respectively. So far, these winds have been studied only from low dispersion IUE spectra and while such data can be used to find wind terminal velocities, they cannot be used for modeling of the wind P Cygni profiles, as has been done for galactic stars using high dispersion spectra. We propose to observe selected O stars in the LMC and SMC in the high dispersion mode to determine accurate mass loss rates. These exposures will be 16-18 hours long, and will be done as combined Vilspa-US1 shifts with our collaborators in Munich. Kudritzki and his group have taken high dispersion spectra of these stars from ESO to analyze the temperatures, gravity and He abundance, arid the UV observations will complement the visual analysis.|Y

The main goal of this program is to infer in some detail the atmospheric structure of a few typical stars   of each type and class. This will involve observing the line-spectra of light ions and use of the most advanced non-LTE model atmospheres.|Y

PAKLW|A Stars in the Pleiades|Lee Anne|Willson|Iowa|We propose to complete our study of A stars in the Pleiades at high resolution in the long wavelength region. Mass loss rates sufficiently high to be observable with IUE, and high enough to force these stars to evolve down the main sequence, has been proposed by Willson, Bowen and Struck-Marcell (1987). This mass loss is expected to be highest for rapidly rotating stars, and to be concentrated towards the equatorial zones, so the stars with the largest vsini values are expected to show the strongest P Cygni profiles. In the 10th episode we are obtaining spectra of the Pleiades A stars with the largest vsinis; preliminary results are encouraging, but it is essential to obtain spectra over a range of vsini and spectral type if we are to rigorously test the hypothesis. We propose here to complete the study by obtaining high-resolution spectra of the remaining Pleiades A stars over the next two episodes of IUE.|Y

PARJH|Emergence of Double-Peaked Emission Lines in Pictor A|Jules P.|Halpern|Columbia University|A new optical spectrum which we have obtained of the nearby (z = 0.035) broad-line radio galaxy Pictor A reveals a very prominent double-peaked component of the Balmer lines which did not appear in any optical or IUE spectra of this object over the past 18 years. Pictor A has therefore just become one of the nearest and brightest examples of the rare family of double-peaked emitters, which are known to occur preferentially in BLRGs. The flux in the new component is comparable to that of the "ordinary" broad emission line which has always been present. The new twin peaks are displaced by 7200 km/s from the rest frame, and can easily be detected and resolved by IUE if they are also present in the Lyman alpha line. We propose to obtain SWP spectra to compare the intensity and profile of the Ly-alpha line with the Balmer lines. Because of its large ultraviolet flux and ideal line profile, Pictor A is the best target out of a very small number of such objects for which IUE can make a contribution to the testing of accretion-disk models, jet models, and other scenarios for double-peaked emission lines. The transient nature of this component urgently demands ultraviolet spectra to be obtained soon, a requirement to which IUE is also uniquely suited.|Y

PCNTS|UV Optical Study of Variability in the Wind from P Cygni|Theodore P.|Snow|Colorado - CASA|We propose to continue monitoring the well-known luminous blue variable star P Cygni for changes in its ultraviolet spectrum which may keep occurring as the star undergoes an extended outburst phase as observed in the optical emission lines. This star belongs to a class of very massive, hot stars which are unstable against radiation pressure, causing them to have highly variable rates of mass loss. Optical spectroscopy in late January 1990 revealed enhanced Balmer emission lines, indicating that P Cygni had just entered a new phase of enhanced mass loss. Since then we have monitored the star in the ultraviolet using IUE and in the visible using the Sommers Bausch observatory, finding significant variations in the profiles of UV lines formed in the expanding atmosphere, and even more marked variations in H-alpha. The most significant variations in the uv occurred during the first month of the outburst, but subtle changes are still occurring; in addition, H-alpha continues to change markedly. Here we proposed to obtain an additional 3 US2 shifts (to be split into half shifts) so that we can continue to monitor the star as the outburst phase continues.|Y
PCOEB|The UV Lightcurve and UV Reflectance of the Pluto-Charon System|Edwin S.|Barker|U Texas - Austin|Stern, at al. (1991) have presented evidence based on previous IUE spectra for a variable UV (2675-3000A) light curve for the Pluto-Charon system. By defining two UV light curve bandpasses, UV1 (2675-2775A) and UV2 (22875-3000A), they produced two UV light curves for the Pluto-Charon system from the individual LWP spectra. The primary conclusion was that the UV albedo decreases substantially between 0.45 and 0.7 rotational phase; this is in contrast to the visible light curve which reaches a maximum near 0.65 phase. The reflectance of the Pluto-Charon system has a slight bluish slope between 2675A and 3200A which implies a transition to a reddish slope in the 3000-3200A region to match the reddish slope determined from ground-based observations.  The prime goal of this proposal is to complete the coverage of Pluto-Charon UV light curve, since only 26% of the light curve has been observed. A complete, uniformly sampled UV light curve will allow us to analyze the following questions about the surface properties of Pluto and Charon: (1) Does the anti-correlation of the UV and visible light curves exist over the entire rotational light curve or just around the hypothesized bright "spot" at visible light curve maximum; (2) Does the contrast (or amplitude) of the light curve increase in the UV as It is for Triton's UV light curve (Stern, et al. 1991); (3) What is the nature and spatial distribution of the substance on the surface of Pluto-Charon system that causes the slope of the reflectance to change in the 3000-3200A region? We propose to obtain seven LWP spectra at specific rotational phases to fillin the UV light curve of the Pluto-Charon system.|Y
PCPAF|HD 93521: Rosetta Stone for the Photospheric Connection|Alexander W.|Fullerton|U Delaware|We have discovered that the rapidly-rotating O star HD 93521 has a photospheric velocity field dominated by a single, repeatable, periodic mode of nonradial pulsation. No other star is known to have both this characteristic and strong UV P Cygni profiles (which, in this star, are partially due to rotational distortion of its stellar wind and which, additionally, exhibit time-variable discrete absorption components [DAC]). Furthermore, we have been able to make a direct observational estimate of the rotation period of HD 93521. It therefore provides a unique "Rosetta Stone" for investigating the initiation of wind instabilities by photospheric velocity fields (the "photospheric connection") and for studying rotationallymodulated wind structures. We propose to obtain time-resolved, high-resolution IUE spectra of HD 93521 over 2 complete rotational periods (3 days) in order to search for phase-dependent variability of its stellar wind on pulsational and rotational time scales. These data will permit us to address directly the fundamental question of the existence of a "photospheric connection," and will provide a new basis for interpreting the correlation of evolution and recurrence of DAC with v sin i .|Y

The proposed high-dispersion spectrum would be used to determine whether this feature is circumstellar or photospheric, and whether there are other heavy element lines associated with it. Low-resolution spectra will also be obtained of the similar system RE 2013+400, in order to determine whether it has a comparable C IV feature.|Y

PEHAM|UV Variability in Two Peculiar Emission Stars in the Magellanic Clouds|Andrew G.|Michalitsianos|NASA/GSFC|The peculiar emission star SMC S-18 is characterized by a variety of spectral properties in the UV and optical that suggest high mass loss rates, turbulence from wide emission lines and indications of both high and low density material in the stellar neighborhood. S 18 is by far the most peculiar emission star studied in the Small Magellanic Cloud with IUE, because it exhibits significant temporal variations on timescales of months in high ionization emission lines of C IV 1548,1550 and He II 1640, and particularly N V 1245,1249. However, the UV emission line spectrum of SMC S-18 is strikingly similar to another recently observed peculiar star LMC " Anonymous" (Sanduleak's Star in the Large Magellanic Cloud). Sanduleak's star in the LMC appears deficient in carbon, while three stages nitrogen, together with doubly ionized Helium, dominate the far-UV 1200-2000 wavelength range. Strong N V 1239,1243 emission in contrast to the relatively weak C IV emission in LMC 5 "Anonymous" indicates that a highly ionized gas at approximately -10^5K gives rise to the chemically peculiar spectrum of the object, and suggests the presence of CNO processed material that is expected during advanced stages of evolution. We suspect that the emission line spectrum of Sanduleak's Star (in the LMC) is variable, since it is strikingly similar (based on the one IUE spectrum that exists of this object) to the UV emission line spectrum of SMC S18. We request IUE observing time in order to determine if the UV emission line spectrum of LMC "Anonymous" shares similar temporal variability as found for its counterpart in the SMC. If variability which is suggested from optical observations is confirmed in high excitation UV emission lines, the distinguishing characteristics of SMC S-18 and LMC "Anonymous" could indicate the existence of a highly evolved group of peculiar emission stars which are unique to the Magellanic Clouds, our observing program, justification and method of data analysis are discussed.|Y
PEHGW|Ultraviolet Spectra of the Peculiar Star HR 6560|Gary A.|Wegner|Dartmouth University|High and low resolution spectroscopy of the peculiar star HR 6560 (=HD159870) is proposed. The visual spectrum of this object shows that it is a "stiking example" of the Fm class with a spectral type of F8 IV from the metals and A7 from CaII. An estimate of the effective temperature from the H gamma line profile and the Beta - index yields 6500 OK. The star shows Ap-like spectroscopic peculiarities in that the rare earth lines in its spectrum are abnormally strong compared to normal objects of similar temperature. However, the true nature of HR 6560 remains unknown. This is because the following two questions are still unanswered: (1) Are the abundance peculiarities due to an evolved companion and (2) what is the star's luminosity? The proposed observations are expected to help resolve these questions and to possibly throw new light on the origins of the Ap, Am, and Fm stars.|Y

PGOJS|Intrinsic C IV Absorption in PG-QSOs and Seyfert Galaxies|J. Michael|Shull|Colorado - CASA|We propose to complete a major search for intrinsic C IV absorption lines in two complete samples of active galactic nuclei: 48 CfA Seyfert galaxies and 35 PG quasars with V < 15.5 and z < 1. A sizeable fraction of these objects show such absorption, indicative of an outflow of ionized gas (a wind ?) from the nuclear region or from an accretion disk. The production mechanism for the C IV is not known; it could arise from wind entrainment of gas from a disk and broad-line clouds, or from disk heating by UV/X-rays. All AGNs in our sample are well observed at optical, radio, and X-ray wavelengths. This survey can be used as a means of understanding the possible connection of these AGNs with the radio-quiet broad absorption-line (BAL) QSOs, possibly a higher-redshift, high-luminosity version of the same phenomenon. This survey will also identify ideal candidates for an absorption-line reverberation analysis, as has been performed for NGC 4151, NGC 3516, and NGC 5548. It also will help with high-resolution studies of absorption systems with HST (FOS and GHRS).|Y

PLHNE|New Calibrators for the Cepheid Period-Luminosity Relation|Nancy Remage|Evans|CSC|The Cepheid-period luminosity relation is a primary distance indicator in extragalactic studies. It is an important tool in studies of young stars, star formation, and abundances in nearby galaxies, as well as a test of models of stellar evolution and pulsation.  This proposal introduces binary Cepheids as the first new class of Cepheid luminosity calibrators since cluster Cepheids. IUE LWP and SWP spectra can be used to derive all four parameters needed to obtain an absolute magnitude for a Cepheid from the absolute magnitude of the blue companion: the magnitude difference between the two stars, the temperature of the companion, the luminosity of the companion, and the reddening of the system. As described below, IUE spectra are the only way to derive a magnitude difference and the temperature of the companion. In addition, the investigation of the reddening by studying the spectrum of the companion in the 2200 A region provides a new check of the Cepheid reddening scale.  Previous IUE studies have obtained spectra of 18 Cepheid/companion pairs. However, no previous study has derived the magnitude differences between the stars, and thus made possible the use of binary Cepheids as luminosity calibrators.|Y
PLORP|The Peculiar Luminous Star BD+14 3887|Ronald S.|Polidan|NASA/GSFC|We propose to observe the probable Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) BD+14 3887. These observations will be compared with ground based optical and IR spectra. We will compare BD+14  3887 to IUE and ground based observations of other LBV's. BD+14 3887 is a surprisingly unstudied 9.9 visual magnitude, heavily reddened object whose optical spectrum consists of an intrinsically blue (~Bl-B3) continuum devoid of absorption features (except interstellar lines), on which one observes strong emission lines of H I, He I, [N II], O I, Na 1, Ca II, a large number Fe II lines, and a few [Fe II] and [Fe III] lines. An existing but rather poor IUE SWP spectrum shows a faint continuum near 1800 A and a rising continuum from ~1500 A shortward to 1400 A where a data drop out eliminates all shorter wavelength data. Examination of the BD+14 3887 optical and ultraviolet data (longward of 2600 A) shows that this object is strikingly similar to the known LBV He 3-1482. If BD+14 3887 is as luminous and evolved as preliminary data indicate it is, it is another eta Car in the making and a spectacular laboratory for studying late stages of massive stellar evolution.|Y
PLRNE|Fluxes, Temperatures and Radii of Stars Defining the Pleiades Zams|Nancy Remage|Evans|ISTS|We propose to obtain absolute flux distributions for early A main sequence stars in the Pleiades open cluster. These observations, when combined with existing archival data, will allow us to set up a sequence of IUE observations defining the Upper Zero Age Main Sequence (ZAMS) from approximately B6 V to A3 V. With these data we will be able to produce improved individual bolometric corrections and effective temperatures because the combined ultraviolet and visual data cover the wavelength range where the majority of the flux is radiated for most of these stars. The proposed and archival data contain at least 8 low-rotation stars of vsini of approximately 100 km/sec or less to check for the possible effects of rotation. Since the distances to the stars are known, the IUE observations, plus temperatures from models, produce a temperature-radius calibration for the main sequence. Archival data also exists for nearby bright spectrophotometric standards of similar spectral type and with accurate trigonometric parallaxes so that direct comparisons of results with these stars is also possible. A small atlas with graphical and numerical results will be generated at the end of the study which should provide a useful comparison tool for the rest of the IUE archive.|Y

PMECI|Ultraviolet Observations of the Pre-Main Sequence Star FU Orionis|Catherine L.|Imhoff|CSC|The star FU Orionis is the prototype of a handful of eruptive pre-main sequence stars. They are characterized by a single outburst, a brightening of 6 magnitudes over several months, followed by the appearance of a peculiar spectrum resembling an A or F supergiant with blueshifted shell lines, later spectral types evident at longer wavelengths, the development of CaII H and K emission, broad absorption lines, and an infrared excess (Herbig 1966, 1977). The precursor is apparently an ordinary T Tauri star. In fact, a statistical analysis by Herbig (1977) shows that such outbursts must occur every 10 years in each star.  Larson (1980) has shown that the event must be a basic structural change in the star, occurring only in the outer envelope (less than 1% of the stellar mass). He suggests that the outburst results from a rotational instability. However, recent rotational velocity determinations for the T Tauri stars indicate that most stars rotate at less than 25 km/sec (Vogel and Kuhi 1981), much less than the near-breakup velocities required for Larson's model.  The remaining viable option is an outburst triggered by a magnetohydrodynamic instability associated with strong magnetic fields (Larson, 1980). Post-outburst, the fields would be diluted by the expansion of the star. However, detection of a moderate chromosphere at this stage would provide indirect evidence of strong magnetic fields in the contracted star. Therefore we propose to look for evidence of such a chromosphere-transition region in the brightest member of the group, FU Orionis itself. The known presence of H-alpha, CaII, and MgII emission indicates that our approach is likely to be fruitful. We wish to obtain a high resolution spectrum of the MgII lines and take a deep exposure at short wavelengths to search for the far-ultraviolet chromospheric and transition region lines.|Y
PMEJL|Post-T Tauri Stars|Jeffrey|Linsky|University of Colorado|We have detected a number of X-ray sources near regions of star formation that are likely to be stars more evolved than the T Tauri stars yet younger than the zeroage main sequence (ZAMS). The sample includes both K7-MO dwarfs with weak H-alpha emission and GS-140 dwarfs which show H-alpha. filled in with chromospheric emission. The star SAO 76567, a rapidly rotating G0 III-IV, is likely to be a star of more than 1 M(sun) crossing the Hertzsprung gap from right to left. Also, a large fraction of the B7-A0 stars in these regions of star formation have X-ray fluxes well in excess of those predicted for main sequence B stars, and could be in binary systems with young, active, low mass stars. We propose to study the outer atmospheres of these stars with IUE to investigate three basic questions. MgII surface fluxes may be able to show how the activity level in the late-type dwarfs relates to that of the T Tauri stars and the dKe stars. Observations of SAO 76567 will be compared with those of other stars in the Hertzsprung gap which are presumably evolving in the other direction. This will be an important test of the rotation-activity relation in G giants, and will show the importance of evolutionary effects on stellar activity. The requested IUE observations of the late B stars should be able to tell whether they are in binaries with active latetype stars or T Tauri stars. Because the post-T Tauri stars have only recently been discovered this will be the first systematic investigation of these stars in the ultraviolet, and should greatly increase our understanding of this poorly understood phase of stellar evolution.|Y
PMFCI|Ultraviolet Observations of the Eruptive Pre-Main Sequence Star FU Orionis|Catherine L.|Imhoff|CSC|The star FU Orionis is a prototype of a handful of eruptive pre-main sequence stars. They are characterized by a single outburst during which the star brightens by 6 mag in the visual and a shell of 10^-5 to 10^-6 M(sun) is ejected. The precursor is apparently a T Tauri star. In fact, statistical analysis by Herbig (1977) shows that such outbursts must occur every 10 years in each T Tauri star. Larson (1980) has shown that the event must be a basic structural change in the star, occurring only in the outer envelope (<l% of the stellar mass). We argue that a magnetohydrodynamic instability is the only viable explanation of the outburst.  In our previous observations, we attempted unsuccessfully to detect farultraviolet chromospheric and transition-region emission lines that would prove the existence of strong magnetic fields, apparently due to high UV extinction. However, we did obtain intriguing line profiles for the MgII h and k lines. We propose to repeat this exposure to verify the weak features of these lines. If we have interpreted the lines correctly, the P Cygni profiles indicate that the star is still undergoing significant mass loss. Thus the MgII lines may indirectly demonstrate the presence of strong magnetic fields by their role in producing a stellar wind.  In addition, we argue that the FU Ori outburst may be the energy source behind the creation of the Herbig-Haro objects. We have detected CIII] 1909 A, one of the stronger lines in the HH objects. We would like to try to detect CII] 2326 A to verify the presence of an HH object in the making. This would provide an observational link among the T Tauri stars, FU Orionis outbursts, and HH objects and would resolve the energetics problem in powering the HH objects. The long low dispersion exposure would also permit a derivation of the UV extinction affecting FU Orionis.|Y
PMGJL|Beyond the T-1/2 Chromospheric Scaling Law|Jeffrey L.|Linsky|Colorado - JILA|We propose to study the effects of evolution off the main sequence on the chromospheres and transition regions of solar mass stars using both archive and new SWP-LO and LWR-HI exposures of G to K subgiants. We will measure the strengths of the strongest emission features of ions such as OI, CI, CII, CIV, SiII, SI-IV, and NV accessible in the short wavelength region, and the strength and shape of the MgII resonance lines in the long wavelength region. We will investigate correlations of these observable quantities with factors such as age, metallicity, vsini, and mass. This should enable us to extend the chromospheric/transition region activity versus age relationships known for main sequence stars to greater stellar ages.|Y
PMHGB|Atmospheric Structures in High and Low Mass T Tauri Stars|Gibor S.|Basri|Berkeley|The effort to understand the origin of the emission features seen in very young stars has been making good progress, in no small part due to the ultraviolet window opened by the IUE. Physical models have been produced for both generic chromospheres and winds for this class of stars, which reproduce the gross features of the observed emission line fluxes and continuum. This work is currently being extended to simultaneous observations of optical and UV spectra of particular stars, with the goal of producing full self-consistent models for specific cases. It is clear, however, that a very significant physical aspect of the atmospheres is being left out. The velocity fields can only be observed with high resolution line profiles, but are among the most interesting properties of these stars. Though a few profiles have been obtained, simultaneous observations of enough diagnostics in specific objects to produce relatively unique interpretations of the profiles are conspicuously absent. This has lead to recurring questions about even the most elementary conclusions on the profile appearances (such as the true direction of the flow). We propose to utilize the unique information available in Mg II profiles along with other calibrated profiles to construct physically meaningful atmospheres for a selected set of T Tauri stars. In this way we will be able to directly assess the mass loss rates, structure and acceleration of the wind, and relative importance of the chromospheric vs. wind region contributions to emission spectra.|Y
PMHSS|Chromospheric Activity in an X-Ray Selected Sample of Young Stars|Stephen E.|Strom|Massachusetts|Observations of solar-type stars on the main sequence show an exponential decay of chromosphric and transition region emission activity with age.  At an age of ~1 million years, T Tauri stars have observed ultraviolet emission line fluxes which lie nearly 2 orders of magnitude above the extrapolated main sequence decay law.  This suggests that chromospheric activity in the T Tauri stars falls to the levels characteristic of older stars by a separate decay mechanism.  For example, the decline in pre-main sequence activity may be caused by the shallowing of the convection zone as young stars approach the main sequence while on the main sequence, the decrease results from rotational spindown.  We propose here to obtain IUE observations of ____ and transision region emission lines for an x-ray selected sample of young stars in the Ophiuchus cloud complex.  These stars may be intermediate in age between the youngest T Tauri stars and their solar-type counterparts on the main sequence. By observing these stars, we hope to determine the characteristics of stellar chromospheres at ages between 10^6 and 10^8 years.  We believe these observations will be critical in identifying the factors which drive the major changes in stellar chromospheres during the early phases of stellar evolution.|Y
PMHTS|Chromospheric Activity in Pre-Main-Sequence Stars|Theodore|Simon|Hawaii|IUE observations of solar-type stars show a decline of chromospheric and TR emission with age. For main-sequence stars older than 100 million yr, this decay is exponential from a plateau defined by the youngest stars. At an age of ~1 million yr, the pre-main-sequence T Tauri stars have UV emission line fluxes some 2 orders of magnitude above the plateau for mainsequence stars. This suggests that chromospheric activity in the T Tauri stars falls to the levels of the older stars by a separate decay scheme. The decline in pre-mainsequence activity may be caused by the evolutionary shallowing of the convection zone, while on the main-sequence it is due to the star's spindown.  This hypothesis needs confirmation, but relatively few T Tauri stars have been observed by IUE. Since the majority of the T Tauri stars thus far observed are probably more massive than the Sun, it may be inappropriate to compare their UV emission with that of the older I Mo dwarf stars. We propose here to observe the ultraviolet chromospheric and TR lines of pre-main-sequence stars we believe to be of ~1 M(sun). We have chosen a sample of low-luminosity M-type T Tauri stars from the T-associations in Lupus; if evolutionary tracks have any validity, a large fraction of those stars should be close to 1 M(sun)in mass. In order to place the stars more accurately on the H-R diagram and to determine their rotation rates (for comparison with the mainsequence stars), we plan concurrent visual spectroscopy and visual-infrared photometry.|Y
PMIGB|Differential Activity Analysis Along the Pre-Main Sequence|Gibor S.|Basri|Berkeley|The T Tauri stars represent the first time during a young star's evolution that we can directly observe its surface. We find them covered by extreme activity with far-UV emission lines up to 3 orders of magnitude stronger than in the quiet sun. These stars also seem to be going through a phase of relatively strong mass loss. Previous studies with the IUE have begun to constrain physical conditions in the stellar atmosphere. They have concentrated on the brightest targets, however, and it is now clear that these may be misleading objects with which to study chromospheric activity in its early phases, since many of the emission line diagnostics are formed in the wind rather than near the stellar surface. This proposal continues work begun last year to examine a more "normal" set of targets. Last year we concentrated on concurrent observations of Ca II and Mg II in lower luminosity stars. This year we wish to obtain complementary UV coverage for by far the most complete set of optical observations ever made on T Tauri stars. We have recently obtained essentially all the optical information possible (resolved, calibrated spectra over the entire visible and near IR region) on stars selected to sample the pre-main sequence differentially with matched pairs. When augmented by UV coverage, the crucial but somewhat neglected effort to obtain data suitable for the construction of physical model atmospheres will be greatly enhanced for the stars most representative of the early evolution of stellar chromospheres.|Y
PMIJL|The Chromospheric and Transition Region Emiss Region Emission Lines of the Herbig Foe Stars BN ORI and N|Jeffrey L.|Linsky|Colorado|We propose to obtain long (10 and 12 hours respectively) LWP high dispersion spectra of the pre-main-sequence Herbig FOe stars BN Ori and NGC 2264 Walker 158. BN Ori is a 2.5 M(sun) star with an age of ~1.5x10^6 K and strong chromospheric and transition region emission lines. W158 is a 2.5 Me star with an age of about 1.2x10^6 years. These spectra in conjunction with SWP-LO spectra obtained in the same shifts will be used to investigate the outer atmospheric structure of BN Ori and W158, leading to models of their chromospheres, transition regions and winds. By comparison of these stars with other high mass pre-main-sequence stars we shall investigate how the outer atmospheric structure of such stars evolves as the stars move towards the main sequence and how this structure depends on stellar mass.|Y
PMJMG|Non-Axisymmetric Winds in T Tauri Stars|Mark S.|Giampapa|NOAO NSO|We propose to obtain high dispersion, large aperture LWP observations of the Mg II h and k lines of a T Tauri star during the course of its rotation period in order to determine the empirical relationship between surface magnetic field regions and winds and mass loss in T Tauri stars. More specifically, we propose to monitor the Mg II hand k line profiles during the rotation period of a T Tauri star to search for evidence of rotational modulation in the blue wings. Such modulation (in both position and the intensity of the wind absorption) would be expected if the wind regions are intimately linked to magnetic field configurations, similar to solar coronal holes, on or near the stellar surface. This phenomenon has recently been observed with the IUE by Praderie at al. (1986) in the wind of AB Aur and thus constitutes the first direct evidence of a non-axisymmetric wind in an A type pre-main sequence star. Clearly, it would be extremely interesting to determine if this phenomenon is present in the precursors of late-type, solar-like stars, namely, the T Tauri stars. The detection of a nonaxisymmetric wind component in a T Tauri star would strongly support the hypothesis that mass loss in T Tauri stars is associated with nonradiative heating. Magnetic field related mass loss mechanisms, such as the Alfven wave driven winds, would consequently become more applicable in the context of mass loss from T Tauri stars. Our previous work indicates that the Mg II 2800 lines are the best diagnostics of physical conditions in the wind acceleration region between the lower chromosphere and the more extended regions in the wind. In addition, we will supplement these IUE observations with simultaneous ground-based observations of the H-alpha profile. In this way we can discern the radial extent of magnetic-field-related variability in the wind component of the profile as modulated by rotation. This additional component of the proposed program may provide a valuable constraint on the lower bound for the Alfven radius in a pre-main sequence star.  We propose to acquire high dispersion LWP observations of the Mg II h and k lines in the T Tauri star SU Aurigae. The upper limit to its rotation period is 3.8 days; hence, we request 4 shifts to completely cover a rotation period. The choice of SU Aur is dictated by the fact that this T Tauri star exhibits both strong X-ray emission and evidence for strong mass loss that Is variable. Thus, both open and closed magnetic field regions are likely present on the stellar surface if the solar analogy is applicable. The feasibility of this IUE program has been demonstrated by two previous high dispersion observations of SU Aur. In order to obtain adequate signal-to-noise, an exposure of 7 hr is required. We must therefore request US1 shifts entirely. If approved, this program would represent the first time a T Tauri star has been monitored for line profile variations during a rotation period.|Y
PMJNK|Evolution of Pre-Main Sequence Stellar Activity|N. Paul|Kuin|ST-Systems|The best known low mass pre-main sequence stars, the T Tauri stars. have very active chromospheres and show a variable emission line spectrum. There is a large variety in activity amongst than. Recently another type of pre-main sequence stars was identified which may be post T Tauri stars (PTTS) and were named 'naked T Tauri stars' (NTTS). These PTTS/NTTS are strong X-Ray sources, and do not have a T Tauri type spectrum. The age of these sources is comparable to those of the T Tauri stars, which implies that either the activity evolves much faster in pre-main sequence stars than the timescale in which they move towards the main sequence, or that an external source is responsible for their activity.  We propose to obtain low resolution long- and short wavelength RE spectra of two of the PTTS/NTTS and of a T Tauri star of comparable activity. Archival data will be used from three other T Tauri stars having larger activity. The data will enable us to derive models for the chromosphere and transition region. Those will clarify whether there is a gradual change in activity, or a sudden one as way be caused by the closing up of an open magnetic field. Because they cover a large range in chromoshperic activity the models will enable us to improve the alfven wave wind models used for T Tau and RU Lup. In particular the question of the wave dissipation scale length and wave leakage will be considered.|Y
PMJSK|Accretion in FU Orionis Stars|Scott J.|Kenyon|CFA SAO|The FU Orionis stars represent a unique opportunity to examine accretion processes in pre-main sequence stars. Low resolution IUE observations will allow us to study the physics of the inner disk and boundary layer in FU Ori and V1057 Cyg. High resolution observations of Mg II and Ca II emission will provide additional constraints on the mass loss rate and the geometry of the wind in FU Ori.|Y
PMLSK|IUE Observations of Pre-Main Sequence Accretion Disks|Scott J.|Kenyon|CFA|FU Orionis variables are an important opportunity to study accretion processes in premain sequence stars. Low resolution IUE observations will allow us to study the physics of the inner disk and boundary layer in Z CMa and FU Ori. Our results will provide new constraints on the consequences of disk accretion during the early stages of stellar evolution.|Y
PMMFY|Herbig Haro Streamers in Orion|Farhad|Yusef-Zadeh|Northwestern|We propose to make a follow-up study of a unique Herbig Haro-like object in Orion and to obtain lowresolution SWP and LWP spectra. This object, known as the Orion "streamer", is located several are-minutes to the north of HR34 and exhibits a remarkably long and narrow structure, unlike the morphology of another HH object with dimensions of 300" x 20" in optical photographs. The optical data indicates a moderately high excitation lines and no scattered continuum, near-IR observations show two 2 micron sources displaced by 10" from the core of the streamer, and radio continuum observations show significant linearly polarized emission at lambda beta cm centered at one of the 2 micron sources. A 365 min SWP exposure of the core of the streamer was recently performed using the IUE where we have detected both uv line and weak continuum emission from this unique source. Preliminary analysis appears to suggest that this source is a low-excitation source in the ultraviolet. We intend to make a more complete IUE observations of this source toward the optical core and toward the radio core where relativistic particles are associated with a low-luminosity stellar object. We hypothesize that the relativistic particles stream through the surrounding neutral medium, ionize the gas completely via collisional ionization, and produce an excitation gradient away from the stellar object as much of the cooling occurs at gas temperatures with spectral signatures in the vacuum ultraviolet. We believe that the targets of the proposed observation are unique in their characteristics and deserve to be observed in more detail following the detection experiment carried out by the IUE in order to determine the relevant mechanisms involved in producing HE objects in star forming regions.|Y
PMPMP|The Blueing Effect in Massive Young Stars|Mario R.|Perez|CSC - IUE Observatory|The remarkable photometric effect known as "blueing" or "color-reversal", in which when the star fades the color index (B-V) becomes bluer instead of redder, as predicted for normal main sequence stars, has been found to be present in several massive pre-main sequence or Herbig Ae/Be stars (HAEBE). This obscuration of the central source in many cases of up to 3 magnitudes, due to probably large thick clouds orbiting in the outer parts of the circumstellar disks, gives us the opportunity of obtaining the spectral signature of bipolar flows, winds normal to the disk, and of the incident scattering. No general consensus exits in the explanation of this phenomenon, which occurs mostly in objects later than A0 and possible edgeon systems. Two case studies, UX Ori and HD 45677, are discussed here, which led us to propose that the blueing effect is the signature of the accretion and bipolar winds in these stars. Therefore, in this proposal we would like to observe a larger sample of massive PMS stars at deep minima in order to properly assess the UV signature of the blueing effect. Our current interpretation of this phenomenon is radically different from the explanations derived from optical photometry. Up to now, the blueing effect has only be observed and interpreted using optical photometry; our goal is to describe this phenomenon in term of UV continuum and emission fluxes in a larger sample of HAEBE stars.|Y

PN2AB|Observations of Planetary Nebulae and of Galactic H II Regions|Albert|Boggess|NASSA/GSFC|Objective: To make spectrophotometric observations of ultraviolet nebular lines for a variety of purposes.  Their relative intensities will yield information about the temperature, density, stage of ionization, and state of excitation of the nebular gas.  In addition, relative intensities for selected combinations of nebular lines provide a measure of the amount of reddening produced by the interstellar dust along the line-of-sight.  A general observational knowledge of the nature and variety of ultraviolet emission spectra also will be of great value in understanding and interpreting observations of peculiar objects seen at large red-shifts.|Y
PNHMC|C/O Ratios in Planetary Nebulae with the 6.2 and 7.7 Micron Emission Features|Martin|Cohen|UC Berkeley|We propose to investigate the C/O ratio in an infrared-selected sample of planetary nebulae. The IUE observations, in combination with ground-based optical spectroscopy, will yield abundance information on all the ionization stages of C and 0 and no modeldependent ionization correction factors need be applied to obtain the total abundances.  The aim of this study is to correlate the nebular C/O ratio with the strength of the unidentified infrared emission features detected in these objects. Laboratory and theoretical studies suggest that these IR emission features are due to carbonbased particulates (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) which are formed in the carbon-rich outflows from the nuclei of these nebulae. The proposed investigation will provide a critical test of this hypothesis.  This proposal is part of an ongoing program to study the unidentified bands, utilizing ground-based and airborne infrared spectroscopy, laboratory experiments, and theoretical model calculations. We wish to determine C/O for 4 new IUE targets, for which our airborne spectra show strong infrared bands. In support of these observations, we request archival data on 5 additional nebulae.|Y
PNHRF|A UV Investigation of the Central Star of the Planetary Nebula S216|Robert A.|Fesen|Colorado-LAS|The galactic nebula, Sharpless 216, which is a nearly circular 100' diameter emission-line object, has been recently discovered to be quite possibly the largest and oldest planetary nebula known. Although originally classified as an H II region, optical spectra (Fesen et al.) and Fabry-Perot line width and velocity measurement (Reynolds) indicate it is a very large low excitation class PN with an unusually low expansion velocity (<4 km s^-1).  Its classification as a definite planetary nebula was until recently in question since there was no identifiable central star. However, recent IUE low dispersion spectra (Blair) has revealed a very hot, blue star (LSV + 46 21) off center in the nebula whose flux can be the source of the observed line emission. Moreover, a preliminary proper motion study of the star shows it moving to the east, towards the nebula's bright eastern edge and with a velocity consistent with a connection to the nebula.  Due to the large size and estimated great age of this planetary nebula (> 10^5 yrs), this central star is a key object in the investigation of stellar evolution from PNN to WD. A few stars are already known to have similar estimated My and effective temperatures and have in fact been described as possible transition objects; however, none of these have any surrounding nebulosities! Because significant spectral differences exist between sdOB and WD's in the UV, we propose, therefore, to obtain a high dispersion SWP image of this star. Our goals are: 1) to determine its spectral classification and H-R diagram location via the high ionization Fe lines (Fe V, Fe VI) and N V, C IV, and Si IV lines, 2) to look for narrow interstellar absorption lines in order to obtain column densities and thus a distance consistency check (via LWP spectra), and 3) to search for narrow, low ionization lines from the nebula itself.|Y
PNHTB|The Ionization Structure of Planetary Nebulae|Timothy|Barker|Wheaton University|I am proposing to complete a long-term study of the ionization structure of planetary nebulae. The idea behind this study is to measure both optical and UV emission line intensities in the same positions in a planetary nebula using similar entrance apertures. Since the ionization frequently changes drastically with position in an extended nebula, this procedure is almost essential in order to make a meaningful comparison between UV and optical measurements. To my knowledge, no other observers are using this approach. The ultimate goals are (1) to observe elements in more stages of ionization than is possible from optical spectra alone; this provides a valuable check on optical ionization correction procedures, which are still useful for nebulae that are too faint for the IUE and for the much larger number (~600) of planetaries that I am surveying optically, (2) by averaging measurements made in different parts of a nebula, to get particularly accurate total abundances so that small differences between nebulae will become apparent; such differences can be sensitive tests of theoretical predictions regarding CNO processing and mixing in the progenitors of planetaries, and (3) to further investigate discrepancies that I have found between optical and UV measurements of the abundances of C; we need to understand these discrepancies before we can have confidence in optical measurements of that important element.  I have chosen NGC 1535, NGC 6302, and NGC 6826 as the final planetaries in this series because each is a particularly unusual object in one or more ways and will benefit from a detailed analysis.|Y
PNLHB|The Pulsating Nucleus of the Planetary Nebula Lo 4|Howard E.|Bond|STScI|The writer has recently discovered that the central star of the planetary nebula Longmore 4 is a pulsating variable. It and the nucleus of Kohoutek 1-16 are the only two known pulsating central stars, but four hot white dwarfs, without detectable planetary nebulae, also exhibit pulsational instability. Lo 4, K 1-16, and these four "GW Virginis" white dwarfs all have optical spectra indicating extremely high effective temperatures (> 100,000 K), and carbon- and oxygen-rich, hydrogen-deficient surface compositions. K 1-16 has been reported to show the fastest known steady stellar wind, with a terminal velocity v infinity ~= 8500 km s^-1.  It is proposed to obtain IUE spectra of the new pulsating planetary nucleus, Lo 4, in order (a) to determine the reddening, distance, and effective temperature; (b) to search for UV features of CNO elements that are seen in K 1-16 and the GW Vir variables; and (c) to search for an ultra-high-speed wind similar to that tentatively seen in K 1-16.|Y
PNLSH|The Planetary Nebula, NGC 2392, and Its Central Star|Sara R.|Heap|NASA/GSFC|We propose to study the physical and evolutionary properties of NGC 2392 (the "Eskimo Nebula") and its central star. The mass of the central star has recently been determined by Kudritzki and colleagues in Munich to be 0.9 solar masses, much higher than the typical value for planetary nuclei. If so, we might be able to detect evolutionary changes in the properties of the star over the course of a few decades or even one decade. Possibly related to the high mass of the nucleus is the recent detection of high-velocity bi-polar jets in the nebula.  We propose to use IUE data to look for evolutionary changes in the spectral properties of the central star, and to determine the physical properties of the jets.|Y
PNMDK|PN G327.7-05.5: A New Planetary Nebula|Detlev|Koester|Louisiana State|Observing time is requested to obtain low-resolution spectra of a newly identified planetary nebula (PN G327.7-05.5) in the field of the galactic cluster NGC6987. A preliminary analysis indicated that the nebula might be a background object and cluster membership is not very likely. This conclusion rests mainly on the estimated visual magnitude of the central star of V = 19.3. In view of the extreme importance of any physical association of a PN with an open cluster for questions of stellar evolution and the PN distance scale we feel it is justified to obtain IUE observations of this object in order to improve the analysis and tests for membership.|Y
PNMMP|Research on Planetary Nebulae|Miriam|Pena|Mexico|We are interested in investigating different aspects of planetary nebulae: (I) The sample of halo planetary nebulae is very limited (of only 4 objects), recently this sample has been enlarged (2 more objects reported by us: PN 242-37.1 and PN 6-41.1). We want to determine their carbon abundance in order to make a comparative study of the evolution of low mass population II objects as well as to obtain more information on the chemical evolution of the early galaxy.  (II) We have recently discovered a new PN in the LMC, of very high surface brightness and with a WR central star. We propose to determine its chemical composition, in particular its carbon abundance. We intend to make a comparison with other objects in the LMC.  (III) Spectral variations of the PN Me 2-1 in the optical range have been reported. In spectra taken in 1987 this object shows the presence of 6830 and 6868 (features usually associated with symbiotic stars); these features had not been seen on previous spectra of Me 2-1. We would like to obtain new IUE data of Me 2-1 to compare with previous spectra in order to determine whether there are any spectral variations present in the UV. In any case this PN shows very mild symbiotic characteristics, which should be studied further to gain insight into the nature of the symbiotic objects.|Y
PNMRD|Shell Edges of Nearby Planetary Nebulae|Reginald J.|Dufour|Rice University|We propose to acquire SWP and LWP spectra through the IUE large aperture of the boundaries of well-defined shell edges of several large nearby planetary nebulae in order to study spatial variations in the UV emission lines across the shell boundaries. These data will be combined with ground-based CCD emission line imagery and long-slit spectrophotometry to study spatial variations in ionization and physical conditions at the edges of PN shells for both optically thick (UV radiation bounded) and thin (material bounded) situations. These results will be useful for assessing modern theoretical ideas about the interaction between stellar remnant produced fastwind with the prior ejected slow-wind red-giantenvelope regarding the formation and morphology of planetary nebulae. Both empirical UV-optical line ratio variations and photoionization models will be employed to determine and evaluate the changes in physical conditions across the shell boundaries.|Y
PNMSH|Direct Evidence for Stellar Evolution: The Central Star of NGC 2392|Sara R.|Heap|NASA/GSFC|We propose to study the physical and evolutionary properties of NGC 2392 (the "Eskimo Nebula") and its central star. The mass of the central star has recently been determined via analysis of the photospheric spectrum (Mendez et al. 1988) and wind spectrum (Pauldrach et al. 1988) to be 0.9 solar masses -- much higher than the typical value for planetary nuclei. If this estimate of stellar mass is correct, we should be able to detect evolutionary changes in the properties of the star over the course of just one decade.  We propose to use IUE data to look for evolutionary changes in the spectral properties of the central star and its wind, and to determine the physical properties of the surrounding nebula. Detection of evolutionary changes in the central star would have two important consequences. First, it would be the first direct confirmation of evolutionary models for post-AGB objects. Second, it would support the high mass-estimate of the central star, and thus, confirm modern non-LTE spectroscopic analysis.  This proposal is an updated version of our proposal on NGC 2392 of December 1988. That proposal was selected, and the proposed observations were obtained in October 1989. Unfortunately, fierce particle radiation forced us to take shorter exposures than planned and produced large amounts of noise, making the spectra unusable for our purposes. We thus propose to repeat our observing program in 1990.|Y
PNMSM|High Temperature Planetary Nebulae in the Magellanic Clouds|Stephen P.|Maran|NASA/GSFC|Following up on our recent discovery that a very hot planetary in the Small Magellanic Cloud has an extraordinary underabundance of carbon, we propose to observe two similar hot planetaries in the Clouds with IUE as part of an optical/UV investigation. The objectives are (1) to test the suggestion that high nebular electron temperatures can result from a strong deficiency of carbon that deprives the nebula of an important cooling channel; and (2) to determine accurate chemical abundances to constrain limits on the efficiency of "hot bottom burning" in massive progenitors of planetary nebulae. The targets are SMC 25 (Te = 34,000 K) and LMC 88 (= 25,500 K). These UV observations of targets not previously observed with IUE will be combined, for analysis, with visible wavelength spectra of both targets from the Anglo-Australian Telescope and the 2-3-m Siding Spring reflector. The objects will also be compared in the analysis stage with previous IUE observations (and consequent modeling) of type I planetaries in the Clouds. Model nebulae will be calculated, and physical parameters of the central stars will be inferred.|Y
PNMWF|HIgh Resolution Study of PN-Nuclei Extremely High Temperature and Low Luminosity|Walter|Fiebelman|NASA/GSFC|Our examination of IUE low-dispersion images of planetary nebulae and their central stars reveals 5 objects with no high-dispersion observations which would yield important new results for PN-nuclei. High-dispersion observations of these objects would provide possibly unique information on the properties of mass loss in the unexplored extreme domains of PN-nuclei evolution. We will obtain high-dispersion data for these objects using the SWP camera. Three of these objects, Lo-1, LT-5 and NGC 6058, are extremely hot; the UV color temperatures (Tc) imply 140,000 K to infinite temperature. If Tc is a valid indicator, these three objects will be the hottest objects ever to be observed at high dispersion with the IUE. The remaining two stars appear to be of low luminosity with implied masses below 0.6M(sun). Of the 20 PN-nuclei with useable high dispersion archival IUE data for studying the photospheric spectrum, few objects fall in this low luminosity domain. Besides using the observed P Cygni profile characteristics to determine mass loss parameters, we will also use the photospheric Fe V, Fe VI, and Fe VII features to constrain our estimates of Teff and luminosity and placement in the H-R diagram. With the observation of these 5 objects we may well have a complete sample of PN-nuclei that can be reached at high-dispersion with the IUE.|Y
PNNLA|An Intensive Study of the Variable Planetary Nebulae|Lawrence H.|Aller|UCLA|NGC 6572 and IC 4997 are well confirmed as planetary nebulae with variable spectra. Mendez, Manchado, and Herrero have called attention to the striking intensity increase of 4686 He II in NGC 6572, while the excitation level of IC 4997 appears to fluctuate on both short and long time scales. No IUE observations of these objects have been made for ten (10) years. Further IUE observations are urgently needed so that extensive ground-based high-dispersion spectroscopy with the Hamilton Echelle spectrograph at Lick Observatory can be utilized to fullest advantage. Our program objective is to obtain plasma diagnostics and chemical compositions (with the aid of theoretical nebular models) with the eventual hope of fixing their evolutionary status and assessing possible constraints on nebular variability. Although of high quality, our echelle observations covering the range 3600 A to 10,200 A at two epochs, 1986 and 1990, are by themselves inadequate to establish C and N abundances (important for the CNO cycle) and to set adequate constraints on theoretical models. The only usable C lines are 1407,9 of C III and 1548,50 of C IV, while all ionic N lines (save [N II]) require IUE observations, as do all ionic Si and Mg lines suitable for abundance determinations.|Y
PNNRR|IUE Observations of a New Planetary Nebula Central Star Candidate|R. Michael|Rich|Columbia University|We propose to obtain ultraviolet spectra of a newly discovered planetary nebula central star (CSPN), CD -41 13967, one of the brightest and youngest known central stars. The presence of a centrally concentrated high surface brightness nebula, IR emission, and a relatively cool (27,OOOK) central star supports our hypothesis that this is an extraordinarily young CSPN. Based on its derived mass, youth, and low temperature, we expect to observe significant mass loss. The UV data will provide an additional measurement of the effective temperature, as well as accurate line profiles to estimate the mass loss. Abundances and radial velocities from optical spectroscopy show that this object is a member of the halo; the UV data will help place CD-41 accurately in the physical HR diagram, and will potentially provide some of the best UV spectra ever obtained for a young CSPN. IUE spectra will also permit study of the UV nebular emission, yielding further insight into the physics of the young nebula.|Y
PNNSH|A Search for Evolutionary Changes in Planetary Nuclei|Sara R.|Heap|NASA/GSFC|We propose to search for signs of evolutionary changes in high-mass central stars of planetary nuclei, as evidenced by optical fading over the lifetime of the IUE. We expect to be able to detect fading in central stars with masses of about 0.75m(sun) and higher. Detecting evolutionary changes in the central star will have two important consequences. First, it will provide the most direct test of evolutionary models for postAGB objects. Second, it might enable us to determine very reliable estimates of stellar mass, and thus provide additional constraints for spectroscopic analysis.  The proposed search has a fair chance of success. We have detected evolutionary changes in the central star of NGC 2392 in the form of "optical fading" of the central star over the lifetime of the IUE. The stellar mass implied by the observed rate of optical fading is 0.75 m(sun).|Y
PNNST|Carbon Abundances of Halo Planetary Nebulae|Silvia|Torres-Peimbert|UNAM|The determination of carbon abundance for planetary nebulae has been of considerable Interest for studying stellar evolution of Intermediate mass stars, since there are great differences In the C/O ratio among the halo objects. We have devoted great efforts to study the chemical composition of halo planetary nebulae. We have been interested in determining their chemical composition in order to make a comparative study of the evolution of low mass population II objects as well as to obtain more information on the chemical evolution of the early galaxy (e. g. Clegg et al. 1987).  Webster (1989) has reported that M2-29 has abnormally high electron temperature. We have recently obtained optical data from the CTIO 4m telescope for this object where we find that the electron temperature is 24000K, log O/H = 7.3, log N/H = and log Ne/H = 6.7 (Pena et al. 1991). This chemical composition locates it definitively among the extreme population II objects. It would be very important to determine the C/O ratio for M2-29.  We would also like to obtain additional observations of BB-1 because the available IUE spectra have the C III] 1909 and C IV 1550 lines saturated. Furthermore we need additional observations of H4-1 in order to measure uv line Intensities with better signalto-noise.|Y
PNNTB|The Ionization Structure of Planetary Nebulae|Timothy|Barker|Wheaton College|I am proposing to make UV observations of the two remaining objects in a carefully-selected group of planetary nebulae in order to complete a longterm study of the ionization structure of planetaries. The idea behind this study is to measure both optical and UV line intensities in the same positions in each nebula using similar entrance apertures. Since the ionization frequently changes drastically with position in an extended object, this procedure is almost essential in order to make a meaningful comparison between UV and optical measurements. To my knowledge, I am the only observer using this approach.  The ultimate goals of these studies are: (1) to observe elements in more stages of ionization than is possible from optical spectra alone; this provides a check on optical ionization correction procedures, which are still useful for faint nebulae and for the much larger number of planetaries that I am surveying optically, (2) by averaging measurements made in different parts of each nebula, to get particularly accurate total abundances so that small differences between nebulae will become apparent; such differences can be sensitive tests of theoretical predictions regarding CNO processing and mixing in the progenitors of planetaries, and (3) to further investigate the detailed physics of the emission processes in nebulae; such details are of general importance to theorists, and we need to understand them better in order to make more reliable abundance measurements in planetaries.|Y
PNOBP|International AGN Watch: Probing the Nuclear Regions of NGC 5548|Bradley M.|Peterson|Ohio State University|We propose to carry out an intensive, short-term spectroscopic monitoring program on the galaxy NGC 5548 to address fundamental problems concerning the nature of the continuum emission from AGNs and the structure and dynamics of the broad-emission line region. The goal of this program is to answer questions which arose out of our previous large International Ultraviolet Explorer program on this same galaxy, but which require more frequent sampling than has been achieved previously. The specific problems we will address are (1) the dynamics of the line-emitting gas, (2) whether or not the Ly-alpha and C IV emission lines begin to respond immediately to continuum variations, and (3) whether or not the ultraviolet and optical continua arise in the same region.|Y
PNOFB|UV Emission Line Imagery of High Excitation Planetary Nebulae|Frederick C.|Bruhweiler|Catholic University|We will use the underutilized, unique UV imaging capability of the IUE to delineate fully the spatial extent and construct accurate surface flux maps for prominent UV emission lines observed in planetary nebulae. We will observe four bright, large angular diameter, high excitation PNs, NGC 3242, 7009, 2392, and 6543. We will obtain multiple low resolution spectral images through the large aperture at different offset locations to completely map out the UV emission morphology in each PN. These individual images will be combined in a grand mosaic to produce largescale flux images for each observed UV emission line. This UV study represents the first of its kind for planetary nebulae. With new IUE data processing that significantly enhances S/N characteristics, to begin January '92, and new techniques that. increase spatial resolution, the resulting UV emission line flux maps acquired with the well-calibrated spectrographs of the IUE should represent a new fundamental dataset and an important tool for addressing unresolved observational and theoretical problems for planetary nebulae.|Y
PNOLA|A Study of Two Possibly Variable Planetary Nebulae|Lawrence H.|Aller|UCLA|The success obtained in our observing program on the well-known variable PN. NGC 6572 and IC 4997, combining data obtained with the IUE and Hamilton Echelle spectrograph at Lick Observatory inspires us to examine two likely candidates for which "first epoch" IUE data already exist, and for which optical spectrophotometry exists from 1944. NGC 6567 is very similar to NGC 6572 while Hu 1-2 (86 -81) is a high excitation object. No satisfactory IUE data have been secured for these PN for about 12 years. Our program objective is to secure plasma diagnostics and chemical compositions (with the aid of theoretical nebular models) with the eventual hope of establishing their evolutionary status. Hamilton echelle data were obtained for Hu 1-2 (3600- 10. 200A) in 1991 and we hope to similarly observe NGC 6567 in 1992. By themselves, ground based data are inadequate to establish abundances of carbon and nitrogen. For abundance determinations, the only trustworthy C lines are 1407, 9 of CIII and 1548, 50 of CIV. Except for [NII], all usable ionic N lines and those of ionic Si and Mg fall in the LTV accessible only to the IUE.|Y
PNOSH|A Search for Evolutionary Changes in Planetary Nuclei - A Continuation|Sara R.|Heap|NASA/GSFC|We propose to continue our search for signs of evolutionary changes in a sample of central stars of planetary nuclei, as evidenced by optical fading over the lifetime of the IUE. We expect to be able to detect fading in central stars with masses of about 0.70m(sun) and higher. Detecting evolutionary changes in the central star will have two important consequences. First, it will provide the most direct test of evolutionary models for post-AGB objects. Second, it will enable us to estimate the stellar mass (or upper limit) in a totally independent way, and thus provide additional constraints for spectroscopic analysis.  We note that we have detected evolutionary changes in the central star of NGC 2392 in the form of "optical fading" of the central star over the lifetime of the IUE. The stellar mass implied by the observed rate of optical(UV) fading is 0.71 m(sun). Several stars observed last year also show signs of rapid evolution in this way, suggesting that the proposed search has an excellent chance of success.|Y
PNPFB|High Dispersion IUE Studies of Hot Central Stars of Planetary Nebula|Frederick C.|Bruhweiler|Catholic University|The PN-nuclei represent the primary evolutionary link between redgiants and white dwarfs. Yet, their locations in the H-R diagram are extremely uncertain, where color temperatures and Zanstra temperatures are often discordant. Perhaps the best diagnostics for these objects lie in their UV spectrum where many photospheric features are seen. Recent advances in non-LTE model atmosphere techniques, availability of better atomic data for high ionization species, and the demonstrated reliability of IUE suggest that fruitful detailed analyses can be performed for the sharp-lined central stars of PN-nuclei. Valid comparisons of IUE and HST/GHRS spectra and new processing schemes developed by the IUE Observatory indicate S/N approaching 20 can be obtained in coadded IUE data.  We will use the non-LTE codes of Hubeny and co-added high dispersion IUE spectra to determine the effective temperature and gravities of twelve (12) hot PN-nuclei. We will also determine the abundances of the CNO elements, using the UV spectral features. This study should present a much more detailed observational picture of the extremely dynamic post-AGB phase of stellar evolution.|Y
PNPMP|LMC Planetary Nebulae with Wolf Rayet Features|Miriam|Pena|UNAM|The sample of known PN nuclei in the LMC with WR features is very limited N110, N133 and N203 - (Monk, Barlow & Clegg 1988). We propose to study nebular and central star properties of these objects to better understand their mass loss processes and the enrichment of the nebular envelope. We have two goals: (A) To search for UV variability in N66 - which in a recent optical study showed WR activity. N66 is a high excitation Type I PN with enhanced N while C and 0 appear depleted relative to LMC PNe. The central star has been reported as a massive one and relatively short time scale variations of the spectroscopic properties could be expected. Observations carried out in 1990 (Torres-Peimbert, Peimbert, Ruiz & Pena 1993) show the presence of stellar WR features in lambda 4686 that were not present in 1985 observations (Pena & Ruiz 1968). (B) We want to derive chemical abundances of the reported WR planetaries, in particular the carbon abundance, which is one of the most affected by stellar evolution and compare them with the abundance behaviour of the overall sample (Aller et al. 1987; Monk et al. 1988). The UV data can be combined with the available optical studies of these objects to derive more complete abundance determinations.|Y
PNPRD|Longslit IUE Spectroscopy of Planetary Nebulae|Reginald J.|Dufour|Rice University|We propose to obtain low dispersion SWP and LWP spectra of several extended planetary nebulae (PNe) with overlapping large aperture exposures in order to study the continuous, radial variations in prominent UV lines through the nebulae. We propose to observe NGC 40, NGC 3132, NGC 3242, and NGC 7662, which all have distinct multi-shell structures. We will correlate the UV line variations across these PNe with ground-based imagery and carefully mapped, longslit CCD spectra of the optical line variations in order to study the ionization structure and physics of the nebulae across the shell boundaries. These observations will provide an important new test of the current wide use of UV-lines for physical and composition diagnostics in PNe, and will permit more accurate modeling of the ionization and density structure of the nebulae.|Y
PNPST|Spatially Resolved IUE Spectrophotometry of the Planetary Nebula NGC 40|Silvia|Torres-Peimbert|UNAM|We are interested in investigating in detail the presence of carbon inhomogeneities in NGC 40, a planetary nebula of extraordinary interest insofar as it is among the few objects that show evidence of inhomogeneous carbon abundances. The nebula close to the WC8 central star appears to be contaminated by the stellar wind (H-poor, C-rich matter), while the outer part of the nebula seems to have a normal composition. To carry out this investigation we propose to obtain high and low dispersion spectra at three locations in the nebula. NGC 40 is very bright, very line-rich, moderately extended (diameter of 36 arc sec), and has relatively low reddening. These make it probably the best PN for ascertaining chemical inhomogeneities in C from IUE spectra using IUE with both low and high dispersion spectra at different positions.|Y
PNRBB|Search for Rapid UV Spectroscopic Variability in PN Nuclei|Bruce|Balick|U Washington|Recent optical spectroscopy of some very bright nuclei of Planetary Nebulae (PNNs) taken at Palomar has revealed astonishing variations of some broad and narrow stellar lines on time scales of under an hour. All bright WR stars (NGC 40, NGC 6543, BD+30'3639) show variations in the C III or C IV profile shapes. All Of stars (IC 4593, NGC 6210, NGC 6543, NGC 6826) show variations in one or two identified lines near 4180 and 4233A (possibly Ca III) , whose line amplitudes vary by factors of two.  The variations might be the result of accelerations at the base of the wind, or they might conceivably result from interactions between members of a mass-exchange binary system. Unfortunately the Palomar observations do not cover enough time or wavelengths to provide clear explanations for the observations.  We propose to monitor the behavior of some of the stronger uv lines by repeating SWP low-resolution spectra (each of a fewminutes duration) of these objects. Tactically, we shall expose and offset so that multiple spectra are obtained in each readout cycle. Only in these ways can we obtain adequately short time resolution. The offset-and-read exposures will be repeated for several hours so that the secular as well as the rapid changes can be monitored.|Y
PNRJH|High Dispersion Observations of the Planetary Nebula Abell 35|Jan Michael|Hollis|NASA/GSFC|We will obtain one very long (400+ minutes) high dispersion LWP exposure of the planetary nebula Abell 35 in order to study the profile of the Mg II resonance doublet. The asymmetry of the Mg II lines, suspected from low dispersion data, will permit us to determine mass loss from the system and explore possible models for the system. A US1 shift is required for this long exposure to avoid high background radiation noise.|Y
PNRLA|Characteristics of Planetary Nebulae of Known Distance|Lawrence H.|Aller|UCLA|Very few galactic planetary nebulae (PN) have good distance determinations. Consequently, basic properties such as nebular size, total energy output, and the luminosities and evolutionary status of the central stars are known for only a few objects. With the Very Large Array (VLA) a Cornell group has undertaken the measurement of distances of a few PN by comparing angular expansion rates with the spectroscopically measured expansion rates in km/s. We want to obtain IUE observations for NGC 6790,6881, 6884, and 7026 to supplement ground-based spectra (365nm -1005nm) being obtained with the Hamilton Echelle at Lick Observatory. These measurements are to be combined with IR, IRAS, and radio frequency results to get plasma diagnostics and ionic concentrations. The program PN appear to be fairly regular in structure so they should be amenable to theoretical modelling. We hope to take advantage of advances in the theory of nebular evolution such as those developed by Balick and his associates. Knowledge of distances of planetary nebulae permit us to find the luminosities of the central stars, and by comparison with theoretical stellar evolutionary tracks, estimate ages. Improved theoretical models also should give better elemental abundances.|Y
PNRMP|Variations of the Central Stars of the LMC Planetary Nebula N66|Miriam|Pena|UNAM|From optical and UV data gathered in the 1957-1994 interval we found that the central star of N66 has suffered dramatic changes in the last few years: *  Before 1987 it showed a featureless weak continuum while its present spectrum shows intense WR features which resemble a WN4.5. In 1993 the UV lines appeared enhanced by a factor of 3 and some of them showed P-Cygni profiles from which a value of  v(inf) = 4200 km/s  was determined.  *  The intensity of the UV and optical stellar continua have increased and the absolute visual magnitude, M(v),  has changed from +1.15 mag in 1987 to -2.01 mag in 1994. *  The effective temperature has diminished from 120,000 K to 50,000 while the bolometric luminosity has decreased from log L/L(sun) = 4.40 to log L/L(sun)  = 4.19.  *  No significant variations have been detected in the nebular line intensity ratios in this period.  We conclude that the star is probably undergoing a final helium flash. We propose to obtain more IUE data of the object in order to monitor the changes of the central star. Additionally, we propose to obtain IUE and optical data of other LMC planetary nebulae with WR nucleus to study their nebular and central star properties and to compare them with N66 characteristics.|Y
PNRWF|IUE Study of an IRAS Protoplanetary Nebula|Walter A.|Feibelman|NASA/GSFC|We will obtain long duration low dispersion SWP and LWP spectra of the protoplanetary source IRAS 08005-2356. One 8-hr US1 exposure is to be devoted to an SWP image, and one 8-hr US2 exposure to an LWP image. This object has been identified by Slijkhuis et al. (1991) as a proto-planetary nebula from photometric and spectroscopic observations that exhibits P Cygni profiles for H-alpha, H-beta and some other emission lines. These indicate a mass loss rate of at least 10^-6 M(sun)/year at velocities of -400 km/s. They also predict that, based on a core mass of 0.6 M(sun), the object will become a planetary nebula in about 150 years. This represents a uniquely short time in the stage of stellar evolution. Of all known planetary nebulae studied so far, only the very young, high density planetary nebula IC 4997 shows an H-alpha P Cygni profile identical to that of IRAS 8005-2356 (see Feibelman et al.(1992), and Hyung et al. (1994, in press). Exploratory LWP and SWP low dispersion exposures (obtained in November 1992 during Director's Discretionary time) indicate that some flux is detected in the LWP region, but much longer exposures are required. The goals of the proposed IUE observations are: 1) to determine UV spectral characteristics of IRAS 08005-2356, 2) to search for nebular emission and use it to determine physical conditions in the proto-planetary nebula, 3) to search for evidence of binarity. i.e. a hot component, and 4) to search for ongoing mass loss from P Cygni profiles.|Y

PPNCG|IUE Observations of A and B Star Candidate Proto-Planetary Systems|Carol A.|Grady|Catholic University|The detection of extended infrared (IR) emission associated with circumstellar (CS) dust around nearby A and B stars has provided an unparalleled opportunity to explore planetary systems which may resemble our own Solar System at an earlier stage of evolution. In a search for such young planetary systems we have used the recently available IRAS Faint Source Survey Database and ADDSCAN/SCANPI software, and have identified an additional 13 new candidate systems.  We propose obtaining IUE low dispersion spectra of our newly identified proto-planetary candidate systems to accurately establish the stellar Teff, and the amount and nature of any UV selective extinction. Those systems with both IR excesses indicating the presence of free-free emission and high v sin i will also be observed in high dispersion to determine whether the CS gas lies in the line of sight, and hence to establish the orientation of the proto-planetary disk. The high and low dispersion data will be used to a) quantitatively establish the amount and nature of the IR excess, b) place size constraints upon CS dust grains, and c) to begin to explore the resemblance of these systems to the much better studied prototype, Beta Pic.|Y
PPOCG|IUE Observations of New A Star Candidate Proto-Planetary Systems|Carol A.|Grady|Catholic University|The detection of extended infrared (IR) emission associated with circurnstellar dust around nearby A and B stars has provided an unparalleled opportunity to explore proto-planetary systems which may resemble our own Solar System at an earlier stage of evolution. Recent searches for circumstellar debris systems using the IRAS Faint Source Survey Database and ADDSCAN/SCANPI products resulted in the detection of several previously unrecognized systems. Extensions of these searches are expected to yield 20-30 new A star proto-planetary candidates. We propose obtaining IUE low dispersion spectra of these systems to establish the stellar Teff, permitting us to accurately model the IR excesses. High dispersion IUE spectra will be used to identify the systems viewed edge-on and to search for the systems with accreting gas similar to Beta Pic. These data will be used to test the hypothesis that high-velocity, collisionally ionized accretion is found only in the systems with debris close to the star.|Y
PPOWF|The Peculiar Planetary M1-77: A Crucial Transition Object|Walter A.|Feibelman|NASA/GSFC|The optical spectrum of the peculiar variable planetary nebula M177 is amazingly similar to that of the unique helium-rich, hydrogen-deficient object V348 Sgr and may be one of two objects that have both R CrB and planetary nebula characteristics. Current thinking is that these objects lie in a rare, short evolutionary phase in which a hot white dwarf has re-ignited its helium-burning shell in a final thermal pulse. If Ml-77 is similar to V348 Sgr in the UV, SWP observations will reveal unusually strong stellar C II 1335 A and C IV 1549 A absorption, reflecting a carbon overabundance, and dredge-up from a Heburning shell. LWP observations could detect circumstellar dust with an extinction peak shifted to 2500 A, suggestive of absorption by amorphous carbon grains. Since Ml-77 may be one of only two known objects in this extremely rare evolutionary phase, IUE observations aimed at probing the nature of the central star and nebula of Ml-77 are essential to achieving a better understanding of the last phases of stellar evolution.|Y
PPPCG|The Evolution of Accretion Phenomena in Massive Proto-Planetary Systems|Carol A.|Grady|Applied Research Corporation|Recent advances in our understanding of massive pre-main sequence stars have revealed that most of the optical, IR, and UV characteristics of these objects are dominated by processes associated with on-going accretion from the circumstellar disk. The IUE archives, while well stocked with observations of high accretion rate systems viewed essentially pole-on to the disk, are notably deficient in observations of the systems we now recognize as viewed through the circumstellar disk. Yet this is the orientation which is identical to the more evolved beta Pic system. Similarly, observations of proto-planetary systems in associations for which age estimates are available, and for which the IR and optical data suggest that we view the system through the disk are currently restricted to 1 object. We propose obtaining IUE data for the remaining edge-on Herbig Ae/Be stars accessible to IUE for which low dispersion spectra in both cameras are unavailable, one additional object, R CrA, for which there are no high dispersion spectra, and a group of high dispersion spectra of near-ZAMS proto-planetary candidates lacking IUE data, to study the evolution of continuum and spectral signatures of accretion in the innermost portions of the circumstellar disks of these proto-planetary systems. This study complements detailed studies of individual objects, and is needed to plan observing strategies for proto-planetary disk systems with ISO and HST.|Y
PPQCG|Probing the Disks and Near-Stellar Environments of PMS Proto-Planetary Disk Systems|Carol|Grady|Applied Research Corporation|Recent studies of Herbig Ae/Be and T Tauri stars have identified several systems viewed through their circumstellar disks. Optical photometric and polarimetric studies have indicated that much of the dust is distributed in opaque clouds which by intermittently obscuring the star act as "natural coronagraphs" making the immediate vicinity of the star detectable. The combination of system orientation and sporadic stellar obscuration enables us to directly observe the signatures of nearstellar dust and material returning to the ISM via bipolar flows, and to place constraints on the dust particle size distribution using techniques developed for ISM extinction studies. We propose acquiring IUE low dispersion spectra of these systems, coordinated with ground-based and IR studies. High dispersion spectra of the brightest sample members will be used to monitor the accreting gas and to place constraints on the amount of emission originating in the disk and that in the bipolar flows. These new data supplemented by archival spectra of our program stars with different levels of obscuration of the star will enable us to probe the contents of the disks and the bipolar flows of a sample of PMS stars ranging from B2-K2 at the epoch of planetesimal formation.|Y

PSKJH|High Dispersion Observations of the Central Star of K1-16|Jay B.|Holberg|Arizona|We propose to obtain a high dispersion SWP image of the central star of the planetary nebula KI-16. The scientific objective of this observation is to provide new information on the photospheric composition and structure of this unique star. Our target, KI-16 is a well studied planetary nebula nucleus, which possesses a number of intriguing similarities to the helium-rich, degenerate, PG 1159 objects. Among the similarities are: rion-radial pulsations perhaps related to those seen in some PG 1159s; a strong overall similarity in optical spectra and energy distributions; and similar soft X-ray to optical luminosity ratios. The photospheres of KI-16 and the PG 1159s exhibit features due to O IV, C IV and He II. Atmospheric compositions remain highly uncertain, in particular the H/He ratio. This situation has inhibited the detailed study of these evolutionarily important objects.|Y

PSOJL|Radiative and Magnetic Properties of Plages on Solar-Type Dwarfs|Jeffrey L.|Linsky|Colorado - JILA|Our objective is to determine the functional and spatial relationship between magnetic and radiative fluxes on the surfaces of solar-like stars. While these relationships are known for the Sun and are consistent with a very limited set, of observations of one star, xi Boo A, we believe that a major accomplishment of IUE in its remaining years would be to establish these functional relationships definitively for solar-like stars.  We will obtain a sequence of spectra for three active solar-type dwarfs: 59 Vir (GO V), Xi Boo A (G8 V), and HD 131511 (K1 V), because they are among the brightest solartype dwarfs that show large rotational modulation, have rotational periods of 5-10 days, do not rotate too fast for magnetic field observations, and he dose enough together in the sky. Crude surface brightness maps in the CII, CIV and Mg II will be compared with simultaneous ground-based observations of the magnetic field strength, the magnetic filling factor, and the net, transverse magnetic field (as measured by broadband linear polarization). These maps will provide estimates of plage areas and surface brightnesses. Our IUE data will serve as a basis for realistic two-component models (quiet+plage) for the chromospheres and transition-regions of active solar-like dwarfs. The new observations of Xi Boo A can be compared with those made in June 1986 to study the evolution of magnetic features on magnetic cycle timescales.  We propose this ambitious observing program while IUE is still operating. One of IUE's great, strengths is that it can monitor stars daily to study variations in their ultraviolet spectra. No other satellite, existing or under construction, can accomplish this important task. The observations are deliberately planned to extend over 2 rotational periods in order to separate secular flux variations from the rotational modulation of an inhomogeneous spatial distribution of brightness across the stellar surface, which is our indicator of the presence and sizes of plages.|Y
PSRKC|A Search for New Planetary System Candidates|Kwang-Ping|Cheng|Catholic University|We propose to complete a systematic search for possible planetary system candidates in a volume limited sample of 62 nearby A stars. Since the evolutionary lifetimes of A stars (< 10^9 yrs) roughly correspond to the era of planet formation and subsequent "heavy bombardment" in our solar system, our study could provide valuable insight into the origin of our own Solar System. From our ground-based (McMath-Pierce telescope at the National Solar Observatory, the McDonald 107-inch telescope, and the 60-inch telescope at CTIO) high-resolution (lamda/delta-lambda >120,000) visual spectroscopy of these nearby main-sequence A stars, we have identified several stars with circumstellar gas. Combining these results with our previous IRAS survey (Cheng et al. 1992, Ap.J., 396, L83) we can probe the link between stars with circumstellar gas and those showing circumstellar dust disks. However, to verify the circumstellar origin of gas and to determine the amount of gas, high-dispersion IUE spectra are required (Cheng et al. 1994, Ap.J., 425, L33).|Y

PTHTA|A Critical Test of the SWP Wavelenght Scale|Thomas R.|Ayres|Colorado Lasp|Calibrations using the onboard platinum hollow-cathode lamps of the IUE provide a high degree of internal consistency in the derived wavelengths of SWP echelle images. However, it has been recognized recently that SWP images suffer small, stable wavelength distortions on spatial scales comparable to, or larger than, the size of the calibration 'spots'. Although the distortions are small enough that routine observations are not appreciably affected, there are several programs involving high-precision measurements of late-type chromospheric emission-line stars where the presence of the wavelength distortions might seriously compromise the scientific objectives.  I propose, therefore, to undertake a detailed study of small-scale wavelength distortions in SWP echelle-mode images. The study will consist of two parallel parts: - A detailed analysis of existing images of the onboard calibration lamp based on very recent laboratory measurements of the lamp spectrum. The new measurements increase by a factor of about three the number of emission spots in the calibration images for which reliable laboratory wavelengths are available. Accordingly, the spatial extents of the wavelength distortions can be mapped significantly more accurately than previously.  - A critical empirical test of the fidelity of the IUE wavelength scales for a typical chromospheric emission-line star based on observations of the target at different locations in the large aperture. By positioning the target at one end of the large aperture, parallel to the dispersion direction, one should obtain the same wavelength scale as for an aperture-center observation, aside from the easily calculated shift owing to the physical translation of the 'image'. Any differences between relative line positions in apertureedge and aperture-center observations therefore should reveal the extent of the wavelength distortions. The chromospheric emission-line stars are important for such a test because their high-excitation, far-ultraviolet emission lines are much broader than the calibration lines, but are narrow enough that comparatively subtle dynamical phenomena--like the 10-20 km s^-1 redshifts of the C IV and Si IV doublets of Capella--can be measured at a significant level. Therefore, the broad lines of the stellar sources might respond differently to the wavelength distortions than the narrow lines of the calibration lamps: Gauging of the magnitude of the effect is critically important to the study of the dynamics of high-excitation plasma in the outer atmospheres of late-type stars.|Y
PUPBM|The Unique Pulsar/Be Star System SS 2883 at Periastron Encounter|Bruce M.|McCollum|CSC - IUE Observatory|It has recently been discovered that there is a radio pulsar orbiting the Be star SS 2883. This is the first radio pulsar known to have a massive nondegenerate companion. As such it is a unique and important link between Be/X-ray binaries and recycled pulsars. The pulsar, PSR 1259-63, orbits the Be star in a highly eccentric orbit with a period of a few years. In early 1994, the pulsar will pass within a few (Be) stellar radii of SS 2883. At this time there should be a substantial emission outburst. This proposal is part of a multinational, multiwavelength program to simultaneously monitor this object during the 1994 periastron encounter, at radio, IR, optical, UV, and X-ray wavelengths. The IUE will contribute by providing crucial information on the state of the continuum and physical conditions in the stellar wind during the periastron accretion event.|Y

QAJDT|Qso Lyman Limit Absorbers|David A.|Tytler|Columbia University|Recent work on quasar absorption line systems challenges many fundamental and widely-held beliefs about their nature, origin, and cosmological evolution. I identify low redshift (z < 1) Lyman limit absorption systems as the most productive avenue for new observations directed at a physical understanding of these newly uncovered mysteries. To this end I propose to observe 6 low redshift quasars with the IUE SWP camera. These data will augment the existing critical low redshift absorption system sample by 30%.|Y
QAJDY|Origin of CIV in QSO Absorption Line Systems|Donald G.|York|Chicago|Evidence far Galactic Halo Gas (T <80000 K) has accumulated over the past few years. Work by several researchers has led to surprising conclusions. The gas is not as extended to high z as expected (d < 10kpc). By contrast, similar lines occur so  frequently in spectra of distant QSO's that the postulated intervening galaxy halos must be 40- 100 kpc In size. The Galactic lines are found mainly near zero velocity +` 50 km s^-1 , whereas QSO lines are often much broader and consist of many components.  We propose to contInue studies of lines of sight to extragalactic objects in search of an analogy for QSO absorption lines. Our specific goals are 1) test directly a new hypothesis that gas rich dwarf galaxies produce absorption lines similar to QSO absorption lines and 2) continue to accumulate information on  the uniformity of CIV In our halo.  Previous observations by us have demonstrated the feasibility of doing this pi 091 Ni wIth lUE. This proposal includes now objects, brighter than most of those previously used, in the SWP wavelength range.|Y

QCEBW|The Continuum Energy Distributions of Quasars|Beverley J.|Wills|Texas|We propose to observe IUE spectra of two intermediate-redshift quasars for which we have high signal to noise ground-based observations, in order to investigate the continuum energy distribution over a wide wavelength range. By taking into account the line spectrum as well, we hope to derive the underlying continuum, and by comparison with other data already available over this wide wavelength range, we hope to gain insight into the relative contributions of different processes affecting the continuum, such as power law(s) from synchrotron processes, possible thermal contributions, etc. We expect the results to have implications for the nature of the quasars' energy source.  (1) Since we have not observed changes in Ton 28 it may be possible to relax the requirement in this case. We do not have enough evidence either way for Ton 202.|Y
QCHBW|Continuum Variability of Intermediate Redshift Quasars|Beverley J.|Wills|Texas|We propose co-ordinated IUE - McDonald Observatory - IRTF (NASA's Infra-red Telescope Facility) observations of the continuum energy distribution and line spectra of intermediate redshift quasars for which we have previous UV-opticalIR spectra. Thus we hope to extend our previous program of decomposing the continua into various components (synchrotron, thermal "disk", etc.), by investigating their variability. We expect the results to have implications for the nature of the "power-law" source and/or the "disk". One of our previously observed lower luminosity quasars has shown line variability in the optical and we wish to re-observe the lines in the UV.|Y
QCIMM|The Bluest Quasars: Spectral Energy Distributrgy Distributions Extending Below the Lyman Limit (Archival)|Matthew A.|Malkan|CAL LA|We propose to study the intrinsic energy distributions of 17 inter-mediate redshift (0.35 < Z < 1.3) quasars with observed, but unpublished IUE spectra. The IUE spectra will be combined with existing optical and infrared data, some of which will be obtained in January/February 1986 at Lick Observatory and IRTF, to provide unique spectral coverage from 10 micrometers through the ultraviolet, down to wavelengths below the Lyman limit at 912A for our study. Special emphasis will be placed on identifying those quasars with the bluest UV/optical colors, since they are least likely to be reddened.  Quasar energy distributions, as measured in Vfv, rise down to a wavelength of around 1500A and must peak somewhere between 1200A and around 200A (Figure 1). The exact shape of the peak is currently one of the most crucial questions in quasar continuum studies. The central frequency and width of this energy peak are not yet well determined due to the absorption and reddening along the lineof-sight. The reddenings are caused by the dust in the Milky Way and in the quasar host galaxy while the absorption is primarily due to intergalactic neutral hydrogen. By focusing on quasars with the bluest colors, intermediate redshifts (0.35 < Z < 1.3), and high-galactic latitudes (|b| > 300), our study will determine the intrinsic far-UV continuum fluxes with greater reliability than previous work.  We request access to the archived spectra of all these 17 quasars (Table 1) to measure the central frequency and width of the energy peak to derive better estimates of the complete quasar energy budget, the ionizing flux spectrum, and to test hypotheses on the origin of the continuum.|Y
QCIRG|The Distribution of Quasar Emission Line Strengths|Richard F.|Green|Arizona|The surface density of high redshift quasars derived from slitless spectroscopic surveys is an underestimate of the total value because of the detection limit in emission-line equivalent width. The fraction of objects lost is unknown, because the form of the distribution of emissionline intensities is not well determined. The solution is to derive the distribution of line strengths for Ly-alpha and C IV from a large sample of quasars selected initially without regard to emission-line strength.  This proposal is to compile such a sample of over 90 quasars from IUE archival material, combined with our own IUE observations. We propose to re-extract the net spectra from the line-by-line data at the RDAF and measure the intensities and velocity profiles, to produce a large uniform data set. From these data, we can derive the form of the sparsely populated extremes of the distribution of emission-line properties.|Y
QCJEH|UV Studies of Extended Emission-Line Regions Around QSOS|Esther M.|Hu|Inst Astronomy|Optical narrow-band imaging and spectroscopy have provided extensive data on the extended emission systems surrounding several nearby quasars (0.15 < z < 0.45). The character of these systems is crucial to understanding the feedIng mechanism of QSOs (e.g. tidal interactions or cooling flows) and appears to be intimately related to the nuclear properties of the quasar (broad-line characteristics, radio luminosity, and morphology). The companion Ly-alpha emission to the distant (z ~ 3.2) quasar PKS 1614+051 may be such a system (based on luminosity and morphological similarity), and the UV study of nearby quasar emission systems can have important consequences for optical studies of high z quasar systems. We propose to use the IUE satellite to make L-alpha measurements of the brightest of these systems which are also well separated from the quasar. Aperture position angles will be selected using data on the optical morphology to achieve maximum projected spatial separation from the quasars. This data will be combined with fluxed optical data to obtain measurements (or upper bounds) on the L-alpha/H-beta ratio in the sample, and will then be used to predict the detectability of extended emission-line systems at high z. The L-alpha/H-beta ratio also provides an extremely sensitive diagnostic to small amounts of dust in the systems and may provide a diagnostic between tidal interaction (where dust is expected at significant levels) and cooling flows (where dust is destroyed in the hot phase).|Y

QFEBW|FE II Ultraviolet Lines in Seyfert 1 Nuclei & Quasars|Beverley J.|Wills|Texas|We propose to observe two bright Seyfert galaxy nuclei in the wavelength range 1150 to >8500 A, with good signal-to-noise ratio, in order to compare their broad line strengths with predictions from photoionization models for the Fe II multiplet emission. The large wavelength range will allow us to estimate the continuum with more certainty than for UV or optical observations alone. The spectra of the broad-line emitting regions of Seyfert I nuclei will extend our groundbased spectra of higher redshift quasars and the comparison should provide a good test of our ideas about the quasars Fe II lines.|Y
QFJCG|Unique FE II Quasars|C. Martin|Gaskell|Sunt at Stony Brook|Observations are sought of two low-redshift quasars which are unusual in two respects: they have extremely narrow broad lines (FWHMs of 420 and 470 km/sec) and unusually weak Balmer lines. They also appear to have exceptionally strong Fe II emission compared with the Balmer lines but this is entirely because the Balmer lines are suppressed and the Fe II emission is "normal"). No UV observations have been obtained for any such quasars, so it is not yet known if they are unusual in their UV line properties, and this is a major question to be addressed by the proposed research. I aim to find out why these quasars are so unusual in their kinematics and physical conditions. There are some specific predictions that will be tested. First it is predicted that they might be broad absorption line quasars. If this proves to be so it will almost double the known number of low redshift quasars with broad absorption lines and ebtablish an important link between emission line and absorption line properties. There is a prediction in the literature that these quasars will show a high Si III]/C III] ratio indicating an unusually high density. This can obviously be tested. There are two classes of model for the production of the puzzling low ionization clouds in quasars (i.e. those producing Fe II), models which produce Fe II in the same clouds that give the high ionization lines (the so called "standard model") and models which produce it in radically different clouds (the model I favor myself). These make quite different predictions about the strengths and widths of the UV lines. If the standard model is correct for example Lyman-alpha should be extremely weak and all the UV lines should be unresolved by the IUE. If the normal broad wings (HWOI of 15000 km/sec) are seen on C IV then a two families of cloud model is favored. The Lyman-alpha/C IV/C III] ratio will be an important diagnostic of conditions. It is also predicted that Mg II will be suppressed. All of these questions can be readily answered with IUE spectra and progress made in understanding the gas at the very centers of quasars.|Y

QROAP|Lyman Continua and Absorption Systems in Bright High Redshift Quasars|Alain|Porter|KPNO|Observation of high redshift quasars bright enough for IUE is of primary importance for at least two basic reasons: 1) to identify unabsorbed quasars whose continua can be studied below the Lyman limit, allowing better constraints on models of this emission, and 2) to identify line-of-sight Lyman-alpha absorption systems and study their properties, both with the discovery spectra and ground-based followup. Lines of sight to quasars are a probe of a regime of the intergalactic medium not readily sampled by imaging surveys.  We propose to observe 6 new bright (m < 17) high redshift (z > 1.9) quasars from recent CWRU and Byurakan surveys with these goals in mind. By clarifying possible problems with the standard accretion disk model, the new spectra should contribute to improved estimates of black hole mass and accretion rate in quasars. By enlarging the sample of quasars with long wavelength baseline spectra, the new data will also improve our estimates of the importance of intergalactic reddening, which may significantly decrease the apparent number density of high redshift qua sars.|Y

QSBAB|Observation of Type 1 Seyferts and Quasi-Stellar Sources|Albert|Boggess|NASA/GSFC|We propose to observe Type 1 Seyfert galaxies and Quasi-Stellar Sources to study their similarities and possible differences. Emission line ratios Ly-alpha/C IV/C III/Mg II/Hbeta, the shape of the continuum, and the presence of internal dust will be investigated. The spectrum between 2300 and 280OA will be searched for absorption features which have been suggested to excite the optical Fe II emission lines by resonance fluorescence. Variations in brightness and emission line intensity and simultaneous observations with orbiting X-ray experiments are the other areas of research.|Y
QSBAD|Ultraviolet Spectrophotometry of Quasars and Active Galactic Nuclei|Arthur F.|Davidsen|Johns Hopkins|We propose to utilize the IUE low resolution spectrograph to obtain far-ultraviolet and near-ultraviolet observations of three extragalactic objects of unusual interest. These are: (1) Ton 490 (= 1011 + 250), a very bright high-redshift QSO in which the continuum far below the Lyman limit can be explored and a search can be made for the He I 584 resonance line and the He I jump at 504 A; (2) MR 2251-178, a bright low-redshift QSO associated with the x-ray source 2A 2251179; and (3) I Zw I (= 0051 + 12), a bright Seyfert galaxy with an optical spectrum similar in many ways to 3C 273.|Y
QSBBW|UV-Optical Spectrophotometry of Interesting QSO-Like Objects|Beverley J.|Wills|Texas|We propose to make low-resolution UV spectrophotometric observations of bright QSO-like objects, combining these data with those obtained at McDonald Observatory with similar or better wavelength resolution at optical wavelengths, if necessary obtained as closely as possible in time to the UV observations. The purpose of the observations is to use the continuum shape and emission line strengths to place constraints on the energy sources in these objects, and on the emission-line region itself.|Y
QSBJO|Research on Emission Line Galaxies|J. Beverly|Oke|CIT|Fifteen sessions in shift one are requested, to obtain low dispersion spectra of (1) Seyfert galaxies of types I and II, (2) galaxies which are predominantly H II regions, and (3) nearby giant ellipticals. In the case of the Seyferts the questions to be answered areas follows: (a) Are profiles of lines such as lambda 1550 of C IV, Lalpha, and lambda 1909 C III] similar to those in the visual? (b) The continuum in Type I's flattens in the violet. This ought to happen for Type II's but at a lower flux level and further in the ultraviolet. Is this the case? (c) Is the Balmer to Lyman line ratio abnormal as it is in the two cases already published? How can one interpret the result? (d) Is the Lalpha photon flux small compared to the number of photons below the Lyman jump as it is in quasars? The H II region galaxies probably contain large numbers of hot O- and B-type stars. It should be possible to detect these in the ultraviolet. One can also find out if the emission lines come from the ultraviolet stellar radiation or from some other source such as kinetic energy in clouds.  The giant elliptical galaxy ultraviolet energy distributions will be compared with similar existing data for large redshift galaxies to see if evolutionary effects can be seen between epochs corresponding to redshifts z = 0.003 and z = 0.40 to 0.60.|Y
QSBMG|IUE Observations of Variability of Type I Seyferts|Margaret J.|Geller|Smithsonian|We propose IUE monitoring of the continuum variability of the nuclei of several Type I Seyfert galaxies. The objects are known to be variable at radio, optical and/or x-ray wavelengths. Comparison of flux variations in a variety of wavelength bands will enable us to constrain physical models for the nuclear continuum emission.  For the galaxies in our list calculations indicate that the continuum is detectable in the low dispersion mode of the IUE with both the long and short wavelength cameras. We expect to be able to do ~ 5% photometry in ~ 100 A bands.|Y
QSBMS|Ultraviolet Observations of Quasistellar Objects and the Intergalactic and Intracluster Medium|Maarten|Schmidt|CIT|Our first round observing experience with IUE has encouraged us to propose a program of observations of the faintest quasars that can be successfully detected with the instrument. We propose to observe two classes of quasars: (1) those with high redshifts that will reveal previously unobservable portions of quasar spectra, and (2) medium redshift quasars located behind rich Abell clusters of galaxies. Both types of observations have great potential for important new information.|Y
QSBWS|IUE Observing Time and Support of Research of Long Exposure Observations of Extragalactic Objects|Wallace L.|Sarge|CIT|This proposal, by a transatlantic collaboration, aims to take very long (~ 14 hour) exposures with the IUE Cameras starting during a VILSPA shift and ending during the subsequent low-radiation GODDARD shift. Two new classes of extragalactic observations can be made by such an arrangement, (i) high dispersion observation of the brightest quasar and Seyfert galaxies, and (ii) low dispersion observation of very faint quasars to good signal-tonoise. Because of its unique requirement in observation time and because applicants who would naturally apply to the different agencies are involved, it is appropriate to seek time from all three agencies responsible for the IUE project and we have therefore dispatched this application separately to NASA, ESA and SRC.  We apply for ten sessions in shift one; a complementary request is being made to the other two agencies.|Y
QSCAG|Lyman Alpha Discontinuity in Low Redshift QSOS|A. E.|Glassgold|New York University|Low redshift QSOs will be observed in order to measure the jump in the continuum in the neighborhood of the Lyman edge. The observations will determine a number of important properties of the clouds which produce the broad emission lines of these objects, such as the optical depth, covering factor and distribution of the clouds. It is important to utilize IUE to observe low redshift QSOs in order to avoid the profusion of absorption lines and low signal to noise characteristic of optical studies of high redshift objects.  Measurements of the Lyman edge will test dynamical models of the broad line region of QSOs, In addition, the UV emission line provides important information on the physical properties of this region.|Y
QSCAW|IUE Studies of Seyfert and X-ray Galaxies|Andrew|Wilson|University of Maryland|It is proposed to obtain IUE spectra of 4 bright active nuclei galaxies at least 3 of which are known to be X-ray sources. The 4 objects have been chosen to cover the entire range of Seyfert or Seyfert-like phenomena. The aims of the program are: a) to study the L-alpha/H-beta ratio in both type I and type 2 Seyferts, in order to deduce why this ratio is anomalous in type 1 Seyferts and quasars b) to derive the continuum shapes and determine if the type 2 objects possess power law ultraviolet continua suitable for ionising the gas emitting the optical emission lines, c) to estimate the reddening E(B-V) from the 2200A feature, d) to derive abundances from certain weak lines if they can be detected, e) to compare the line structures with those in the visible, and f) to study the relation of the X-ray, UV and radio continua.|Y
QSCHS|UV Spectrophotometry of Lyman Alpha in QSOs|Harding|Smith|University of California, San Diego|We propose to obtain spectrophotometric observations of quasi-stellar objects in order to obtain Lyman line intensities in objects for which we have obtained optical and infrared measures of the Balmer and Paschen lines. For some time it has been apparent that the hydrogen lines in QSOs do not have the ratios Lyman/Balmer, Balmer/Paschen predicted by simple photoionization/ recombination models, nor do these models combined with conventional reddening by dust predict the observed ratios. The ultraviolet sensitivity of IUE, combined with groundbased instruments will allow measurement of lines from all three hydrogen series in a sample of brighter QSOs. These measures should allow constraints to be set on the physical conditions in the line emitting region, and, indirectly, on the nature of the central energy source.|Y
QSCJO|Emission Line Galaxies|J. Beverly|Oke|CIT|IUE observing time is requested to observe a number of Seyfert galaxies and other emission-line galaxies. The highest priority will be placed on type 2 Seyferts to see if they are similar to NGC 1068, which appears to be explainable with simple recombination theory and reddening. Observations of new type 1 Seyferts will be made to see if the 2175 A interstellar absorption feature is common to most objects. (It is not seen in quasars but is seen in some of the type l's already observed.) Short wavelength spectra will be repeated for those type l's which have already been observed and which may be variable; 3C 120 is a prime candidate. As a back-up program observations will be obtained of additional emission line galaxies which appear to be giant H II regions excited by hot stars.|Y
QSCMG|IUE Observations of Variable X-Ray Seyfert Galaxies|Margaret J.|Geller|Center for Astrophysics|We propose to continue IUE monitoring of the continuum variability of the nuclei of several Type I Seyfert galaxies and of several narrow emission line galaxies which are known variable X-ray sources. Some studies of variability of these objects have already been made at radio, optical and/or X-ray wavelengths. HEAO-A observations indicate some correlations of variability with other physical properties. We propose to test these correlations in the Uv. Comparison of the flux variations at several frequencies constrains physical models of the continuum source. Our first IUE observations of III Zw 2 and MK 509 (May 1979, August 1979) show that the continuum of these objects is detectable at the expected levels in the low dispersion mode with both long and short wavelength cameras. Comparison of our III Zw 2 spectrum with an earlier exposure by D. Morton indicates that the UV continuum varied by ~ 50% on a timescale of months. Together with radio, optical and X-ray variability data, these observations show that the source is non-thermal and indicate that a synchro-Compton model may be applicable.|Y
QSCSG|Emission Line Profiles in Type 1 Seyfert Galaxies|Stephen A.|Gregory|Bowling Green State University|IUE spectra of the Seyfert galaxy NGC4151 show that the CIV 1550 emission line has twice the width of the Balmer lines in this object. The profiles of this line and of the CIII] 1909 line are important for testing theoretical models for the broadline emitting region in type 1 Seyfert galaxies. We propose to obtain these profiles and the relative intensities of these two lines in the following set of type 1 Seyfert galaxies: NGC1566, NGC3227, NGC3516, NGC4593, NGC5548, NGC6814, IC4329A. Also, we hope to obtain the Ly-alpha profiles in these Seyferts and compare them with the Balmer line profiles which are already known. If we can determine these profiles with confidence, we will also be able to obtain the broad component Ly-alpha/H-alpha ratio for these Seyfert galaxies.|Y
QSCTS|IUE Observations of Lyman Alpha and HE2 Alpha 1640 Emission in Bright Low Redshift Quasars|B.|Soifer|Cal Tech|We request time using the IUE to observe the Ly-alpha line of hydrogen and the 1640 line of HeII in the spectra of a significant sample of bright, low redshift quasars. This program will be coupled with optical and infrared programs observing the same quasars to study the Ly-alpha:H-beta:H-alpha :P-alpha 1640/4686 HeII line ratios in these quasars. The goal of this program is to provide observational constraints and guidance in establishing the mechanism(s) responsible for the anomalous hydrogen line ratios in quasars.|Y
QSCWS|Long Exposure Observations of Extragalactic Objects|Wallace L.|Sargent|CIT|This proposal, by a transatlantic collaboration, aims to continue the program of very long (~ 14 hour) exposures with the IUE Cameras starting during a VILSPA shift and ending during the subsequent low-radiation GODDARD shift.

QSDAB|UV Observations of Seyfert Galaxies|Albert|Boggess|NASA/GSFC|We propose to obtain high-quality, broadened (equivalent to trailed) spectra for 9 Type I and 2 Type 2 Seyfert galaxies. Only broadened spectra have sufficient signal-to-noise ratios to allow detailed fitting of line profiles needed to investigate both the kinematics and dynamics of the emitting regions and their stratification. These spectra will also allow more accurate measurements of weak spectral features, such as: OI 1304 and He II 1640, needed to estimate reddening; N IV] 1486, O III] 1663 and N III] 1749, for abundance analyses; absorption lines such as Si IV l400 and C IV 1550, for estimating the covering factor of the broad line region (BLR); and Galactic halo absorption lines of Si II 1260, C II 1335 and Fe II 1608. There are broad features superposed on the spectrum of Seyfert galaxies: the 2200A dust absorption feature, the emission hump at 3200A and several other unidentified bumps and wiggles. Their detection, measurement and quantitative study also require spectra recorded with high signal-to-noise ratios. X-ray spectra are already available for all 9 Type 1 Seyferts, and these data will be combined with our UV continua to estimate the amounts of available ionizing radiation. We also plan to measure the fluxes of the prominent emission lines: L-alpha, SI IV 1400, C IV 1550, C III] 1900 and Mg II 2800, to extend our investigation of the L-alpha/H-beta ratio and to provide a homogeneous set of high quality data to allow the evaluation of models for individual objects instead of, as in the past, for an assumed "typical" Seyfert or quasar.|Y

QSDAW|IUE Studies of Active Galaxies|A. S.|Wilson|Maryland|It is proposed to study two types of active galaxies at low dispersion with IUE. Firstly,we shall concentrate on the small class of E/SO galaxies with broad lines which appear to be excited by shock waves (collisional ionization). These galaxies show no non-stellar continuum in the visual. The aim is to see whether a UV non-stellar continuum exists and whether the line ratios and profiles in the UV are different from normal Seyfert galaxies. Secondly, spectra will be obtained of type 2 Seyferts and X-ray galaxies in order to compare optical and UV line profiles, estimate the reddening and the intrinsic shape of the UV continuum.|Y
QSDBS|IUE Observations of Lya Emission in Bright Moderate Redshift Quasars|B.|Soifer|CIT|We request time using the IUE to observe the Ly-alpha line of hydrogen in the spectra of a significant sample of bright moderate redshift quasars. This program will be coupled with an infrared program observing the same quasars to study the Ly-alpha:H-alpha line ratios in these quasars. In combination with previously acquired data on high redshift and low redshift quasars, these data will provide the basis for the study of the luminosity dependance of the hydrogen line ratios in quasars.|Y
QSDDT|Lyman Continuum Observations of Broad Absorption Line Qsos|David A.|Turnshek|Arizona|Recent studies indicate that a significant fraction of all QSOs have broad absorption lines in their spectra. The observed level of ionization is very high and this leads to extremely tight constraints on the Lyman continuum energy distribution if heating of the absorbing clouds is due to photoionization. Uv observations with IUE are required so that a measurement of the absolute flux in the Lyman continuum can be made. Absorption details in the continuum are not under study. These measurements will allow us to : (i) test the photoionization theory, (ii) place constraints on the quantity ner^2 if the observed Lyman continuum suggests photoionization is operating, and (iii) make fundamental comparisons between broad absorption line QSOs and nonbroad absorption line OSOs studied with IUE. The objects we wish to study all have moderately high redshifts and estimated blue magnitudes between 16.8 and 17-0. Eight shifts are required so that each of the four objects on our list can be observed at both long and short wavelengths.|Y
QSDEW|Luminosity Calibration of Low Z Quasars|E. J.|Wampler|UC Santa Cruz|Ground based observations by Baldwin, Gaskell, and Wampler of flat radio spectrum quasars with z> 1.1 have shown that there is a strong correlation between the CIV equivalent width and the luminosity of the continuum at the wavelength of CIV. We propose to obtain high signal-to-noise spectra of five low redshift quasars from our sample so that we can investigate the CIV equivalent width versus luminosity correlation at low redshifts. This will permit us to improve our estimate of qo based on our corrected Hubble diagram. In choosing the QSOs, we have attempted to remove selection criteria which could bias the result. They all have redshifts of less than 0.5, and we have introduced a magnitude cutoff of 17.0. These additional IUE observations are necessary because only a few of the QSOs already observed with the IUE have the required radio properties and satisfy our selection criteria. We already have groundbased spectrophotometry of all five quasars, and this will permit an additional study of the overall optical-UV spectrum.|Y
QSDHS|UV Spectrophotometry of Qsos & Seyfert Galaxies|H. E.|Smith|UC SD|We propose to obtain spectrophotometric observations of quasi-stellar objects and Seyfert galaxies in order to obtain Lyman-alpha (and other) line intensities for QSOs and Seyfert galaxies for which we have obtained optical and infrared observations of the hydrogen and helium line spectra. The ultraviolet sensitivity of IUE combined with ground based observations will allow measurement of lines from all three hydrogen series (Lyman, Balmer, Paschen) and a detailed comparison of the hydrogen and helium line spectra.  These measures should allow constraints to be set on the physical conditions in the line emitting region, and, indirectly, on the nature of the central energy source.|Y
QSDKD|IUE Observations of Markarian 359, Particularly to Determine Possible Reddening|K.|Davidson|Minnesota|A serious obstacle to the analysis and modeling of emission lines from active galactic nuclei and quasars is our lack of secure knowledge about possible reddening by dust. The only direct, straightforward way of deriving reddening (or lack of reddening) is to observe the apparent intensity ratio of the He II 1640 and 4686 recombination lines. But for most relevant objects, this is very difficult because the He II lines are weak, broad, and confused with Fe II emission.  Markarian 359, however, is a Seyfert-type-l-like object with unusually narrow permitted lines, including He II, and with little Fe II emission; it is an exceptionally suitable object for studying the He II lines. Its spectrum is highly interesting for other reasons also. Therefore, we propose to make a very serious effort, involving the combination of several independent IUE exposures, to obtain a high-quality ultraviolet spectrum of Markarian 359. Such a spectrum can then be compared with ground-based visual-wavelength spectra, especially noting the He II 1640/4686 intensity ratio.|Y
QSDMG|Observations of Variable X-Ray Seyfert Galaxies|Margaret J.|Geller|CFA|We propose to continue IUE monitoring of the continuum variability of the nuclei of several Type 1 Seyfert galaxies and of several narrow emission line galaxies which are known x-ray sources. We have now obtained five spectra of III Zw 2 and 12 of Mk 509. These IUE observations together with nearly simultaneous radio, infra-red, optical, and x-ray data provide some new and interesting insights into the nature of the continuum source. Observations of both objects are consistent with the non-thermal synchro-Compton model, but the detailed physical conditions differ significantly.  We have also obtained IUE spectra of MCGB-11-11, Mk279, N3783, N7582, N7213, ES0141-G55 and N7469. The focus of the continued investigation proposed here is to determine whether the Seyfert 1 and narrow emission line galaxies fall into classes for which IIIZw2 (as a strong radio source) and Mk509 (as a weak radio source) may be regarded as prototypes. We also plan to determine whether the correlation of intrinsic luminosity with variability observed in the x-ray for non-radio Seyferts holds in the UV.|Y
QSDRG|High Redshift Quasars|Richard F.|Green|Arizona|We propose to obtain ultraviolet spectrophotometry of five high redshift quasars, all with magnitudes near 16.5 and redshifts between 1.9 and 2.9. The observations are prompted by four scientific objectives. The first is for further study of a marked steepening in the slope of the quasar spectral energy distribution below about 1200 A, seen in both IUE and optical spectra. The change in mean spectral index from -0.6 to -2.3 has serious implications for the ionization structure of the emissionline clouds and the intergalactic medium, as well as for numbermagnitude counts. Four out of five high redshift quasars observed with IUE showed an optically thick Ly-alpha - Ly edge absorption system somewhere along the line of sight, usually around z ~ 1. A more accurate determination of the redshift density of these absorbers exploits quasars as a direct probe of intergalactic (and interstellar) conditions at otherwise inaccessible redshifts. At least two of the proposed objects are suitable for a line blanketing approach to measuring the density of the Ly-alpha absorption forest, and testing its uniformity as a function of redshift. Finally, we propose to use IUE to explore the previously unobserved spectra of quasars below 650 A, to search for intrinsic emission and for absorption from the ionized intergalactic medium.|Y
QSDRP|UV Spectrophotometry of the 4000 Angstrom to 2000 Angstrom 'Bump'|Richard C.|Puetter|UC SD|We propose to obtain spectrophotometric observations of quasars and Seyfert galaxies which have optical spectra showing the 4000-2000 A "bump" rising into the UV. Recent theoretical models suggest that this feature is primarily due to Balmer continuum emission. These observations will aid in establishing the origin of this feature and thus place strong constraints on the models. If this feature is due to the Balmer continuum (as seems likely) these observations will allow a straightforward model independent determination of (1) the electron temperature,(2) total second level hydrogen column density and (3) the dependence of the n=2 population as a function of depth into the emission line region. In addition, comparison with detailed models will allow determination of the ionizing flux density and distance of the emitting region from the central source.|Y
QSDSG|Reddening Measurements for Seyfert 1 Galaxies|S. A.|Grandi|UCLA|Two models are currently contending as explanations for the "anomalous" L-alpha/H-alpha ratios observed in Seyfert 1 galaxies and QSOs: reddening by dust surrounding the broad-line emission line region and enhanced Balmer line emission arising in extended transition regions of dense, very optically thick emission line clouds. Recent calculations suggest that the latter explanation is correct. On the other hand, the major evidence for the reddening model and the major problem with the enhanced Balmer emission model is the low observed values of "reddening indicators" such as HeII 1640/4686 and O I 1303/8446. However, these ratios are presently available for only a few objects. I propose to observe with IUE 1303 and 1640 in a sample of Seyfert 1 galaxies for which I have already observed 8446 and 4686 in order to determine values for the reddening indicators.|Y
QSDWS|Coord IR Optical, UV, & X-Ray Observations of High-Redshift Quasar Continua|Wallace L.|Sargent|Cal Tech|The continua of Seyfert 1 galaxies and quasars have a strong ultraviolet excess. We have recently found that it is essentially flat (i. e. the excess fv is independent of wavelength) at least down to 1200 A..  X-rav observations require that it have a high-frequency cutoff somewhere below 3 x 10^17 Hz. We Propose to measure the ultraviolet excess at high rest frequencies, by observing highredshift quasars with I.U.E. If the ultraviolet flux is produced thermally, our observations will measure the maximum temperature of the emitting matter. To cover the wide frequency range our analysis requires, we will also make roughly simultaneous infrared, optical, and X-ray observations of all the Program quasars.|Y
QSEAB|UV Observations of Seyfert Galaxies|Albert|Boggess|NASA/GSFC|We propose to obtain high-quality, broadened (equivalent to trailed) spectra for 10 Type 1 Seyfert galaxies with the IUE. Complementary optical data will be obtained from the Mt. Hopkins facility. Only broadened IUE spectra have sufficient signal-to-noise ratios to allow the detailed fitting of line profiles needed to investigate the kinematics, dynamics, and stratification of the emitting regions. These spectra will also allow more accurate measurements of weak spectral features; OI 1304 and He II 1640 are needed to estimate reddening; N IV] 1486, O III] 1663 and N III] 1749 are needed for abundance analyses; the Mg II  2800 absorption line can be used for estimating the covering factor of the broad line region (BLR); and Galactic absorption lines of Si II 1260, C II 1335 and Fe II 1608 can yield additional information on the Galactic halo. There are also broad features superposed on the spectra of Seyfert galaxies: the 2200A dust absorption feature, the emission hump at 3200A and the Fe II emission between 2280 and 2650A. Their detection, measurement and quantitative study also require spectra recorded with high signal-to-noise ratios. X-ray fluxes are already available for eight of the proposed targets, and these data will be combined with our UV continua to estimate the amounts of available ionizing radiation. We also plan to measure the fluxes of the prominent emission lines L-alpha, SI IV 1400, C IV 1550, C III]  1909 and Mg II 2800, to extend our investigation of the L-alpha/H-beta ratio and to provide a homogeneous set of high quality data to allow the evaluation of models for individual objects instead of, as in the past, for an assumed "typical', Seyfert or quasar. Our previous observations have revealed important differences between the emission line properties of Type 1 Seyferts and high redshift quasars. The results from these 3eyferts will greatly strengthen our data base for further investigation.|Y
QSEAD|Variability of the Double Quasar 0957+561 A.

Most recent UV observations Indicate a variability time scale of less than three months. Such measurements will provide the broadest possible frequency base to detect the flux variations In the components and to constrain models of the Intervening galaxy and cluster which act as a gravitational lens causing the double Image.|Y
QSEAG|The Efeect of X-Ray & UV Ionizing Radiation on Quasas Emission Lines|A. E.|Glassgold|New York University|A major result of recent quasar emission line models is that the shape of the ionizing continuum has considerable influence on the observed line ratios. We propose to test this idea by correlating the UV and X-ray ionizing flux with the emission line ratios for an optimized sample of quasars which are observable with IUE and whose X-ray fluxes have been measured with HEAO-B.|Y
QSECW|UV Observations of Low Redshift Quasars|Chi-Chao|Wu|CSC|Our previous observations of Type 1 Seyfert galaxies have revealed important differences between the emission line properties of Seyfert l's and high redshift quasars. We propose to obtain high signalto-noise pseudo-trailed spectra for eight low redshift quasars in order to perform detailed comparisons with our existing spectra of similar high quality for Seyfert I galaxies. We wish to investigate if the morphological distinction of "Seyferts" and "quasars" has any physical meaning and to explore whether the phenomena we observe for active galaxies can be explained by a limited number of parameters, e.g. evolutionary stage, luminosity, radio properties or Fe II emission strength, etc. High quality spectra will give not only the strengths of prominent lines, but also their detailed profiles and the strengths of weak emission and absorption lines. Line profiles and asymmetries provide information on the dynamics and stratification of physical conditions of the broad line region (BLR); and the location of opacity source(s). Weak emission lines such as O I 1304 and He II 1640 and the 2200A broad absorption feature are needed to estimate reddening; N IV] 1486. O III ] 1663 and N III]  1749 are needed for abundance analyses; and Mg II absorption can be used to estimate the covering factor. Fe II emission between 2280 and 2650A and the line ratios of the prominent lines serve as important diagnostic tools for the density, structure (high and low excitation regions, X-ray heating, etc.) and ionization parameters of the broad line clouds.|Y
QSEDT|Observations of Edge on Seyferts with IUE|David A.|Turnshek|Pittsburgh|Objective prism studies have demonstrated that ~ 3 to 10 percent of the QS0s with high emission redshifts exhibit broad, high ionization resonance absorption lines in their spectra. Some QSOs with smaller emission redshifts are also undoubtedly of the broad absorption line type. However, none have as yet been identified since low redshift QSOs (zemm <1.2) have their redshifted high ionization O resonance lines blueward of 3300A. Broad absorption lines might also be expected to be present in type 1 Seyferts as well as GS09 due to the spectroscopic similarity between these two types of objects. Recent Investigations of the distribution of broad absorption line material in velocity space suggest that the large scale spatial distribution of the broad absorption line material is non-random, possibly disk like. The probability of observing broad absorption lines in an object would be high only if the line of sight passed through the disk, It would be reasonable to speculate that this suspected disk of broad absorption line material is aligned with the optical disk of a type 1 Seyfert. In order to test for this exciting possibility, we propose to observe 2 edge-on type 1 Seyferts with IUE (1200 1950A). Note that there are four other edge on type 1 Seyferts which were not|Y
QSEJO|IUE Obs of Variable Type 1 Seyfert Galaxies|J. Beverly|Oke|Cal Tech|It is proposed to obtain IUE observations of three luminous highly variable type 1 Seyfert galaxies 3C 120, 3C 382, and 3C 390.3. All of these objects have been observed in past years with IUE and also are being monitored from the ground on a regular basis. Since most of the interesting UV lines are covered with the short wavelength camera, only short wavelength camera spectra will be obtained. Since changes in the broad lines are known to occur in less than one year, it is proposed to observe the objects twice during the year. Using IUE and visual data it should be possible to show (1) whether the broad line region is expanding or contracting, (2) how large the region is, and (3) whether the region is more nearly like a disk or a thick shell.|Y
QSEMG|IUE Observations of Seyfert Galaxy Variability|Margaret J.|Geller|CFA|We have used IUE to monitor the continuum variability of the nuclei of several Type I and II Seyfert galaxies. There is good coverage on a timescale of ~3 months, and only sparse coverage on shorter timescales. The sampling so far is much too infrequent to resolve the observed variations and hence to set interesting constraints on the size of the UV continuum source. Here we propose to increase our time resolution by a factor of ~10 for the 5 bright Seyferts (MK509, ES0141-G55, F9, NGC7469 and MCG-2-58-22) which can be observed during high background shifts. our data show that MK509 and ES0141-G55 are variable on a timescale of several months. Data obtained from NSSDC shows that F9 is also variable in the UV.|Y
QSEMS|Ultraviolet Observations of an Optically Selected Sample of Low-Redshift Qsos|Michael L.|Sitko|Minnesota|We propose to observe 7 low-redshift QSOs previously studied in the radio, infrared, and optical, in order to test two hypotheses which would explain the correlations of observed optical-infrared spectral index with redshift and with radio loudness.|Y
QSERG|Quasars at Redshift 1|Richard|Green|University of Arizona|We propose to obtain ultraviolet spectrophotometry of four quasars with redshifts between 1.0 and 1.5 and magnitudes between 15.5 and 16.0. The observations are prompted by three scientific objectives. The first is for further study of a marked steepening in the slope of the quasar spectral energy distribution below 1200 A as a function of luminosity. The change in mean spectral index from - 0.6 to - 2.3 has serious implications for the ionization structure of the emission-line clouds and the intergalactic medium. One interpretation to be tested is that the short wavelength flux is fit by a Wien law representing temperatures in the range from 30 to 40,000 K. Secondly, we wish to study Ly-alpha absorption in these objects, both in optically thick systems with metal line absorption as a probe of gas clouds associated with galaxies at high redshift, and as a reconnaissance study for Space Telescope HRS observations of the optically thin Ly-alpha forest. Finally, the asymmetries in the Ly-alpha emission line profile will be compared with those in high resolution C IV and C III] profiles measured optically, and interpreted in the context of models for the broad emission line region. Further physical constraints will be provided by emission lines with wavelengths shorter than Ly-alpha.|Y
QSERH|UV Emission in Quasar QO420_388 with Z=3.12|R. W.|Hobbs|NASA/GSFC|We propose to investigate the UV emission associated high quasar Q042033, intrinsically the most luminous quasar yet detected. The high emission redshift (z=3.12) for this object affords a unique opportunity to confirm whether carbon lines supposedly shifted into the optical region of the spectrum are valid to use for determining redshift systems by observing a quantum mechanically analogous carbon line at 312 A which will be shifted into the vacuum ultraviolet region. Moreover, if ultraviolet continuum radiation is positively detected, it will quantify the supposed transparency of the intergalactic medium.|Y
QSERP|UV/Optical/Infared Observations of Broad Line radio Galaxies|Richard|Puetter|University of California, San Diego|Interpretation of the hydrogen spectrum of broad line radio galaxies is complicated by the effects of both dust and large 1ine optical depths. In order to resolve the relative importance of these two distinct physical effects it is extremely useful to obtain UV, optical and IR hydrogen line observations. rhe L-alpha/Balmer line/P-alpha ratio is sensitive to both radiative transfer effects and the presence of dust. This approach has already proved successful in quasar research. We propose to obtain nearly simultaneous UV/Optical/IR observation of the program objects listed.|Y
QSESG|Time Variations of Emission Lines in Seyfert 1 Galaxies|Stephen A.|Gregory|Bowling Green State University|in previous IUE observations we have discovered time variations in the Ly-alpha and CIV 1550 emission lines in the Seyfert galaxy NGC 5548. These variations include equivalent widths, line profiles, and the Ly-alpha to CIV intensity ratio. Such time variability provides a Strong test for the theoretical models of the broad-line emitting regions of Seyfert 1 galaxies. Thus it is important to follow up this discovery in order to determine as many details as possible of the time variations of broad emission lines. We propose to obtain spectra with good signal to noise, by using the "pseudotrailed" technique, of a set of Seyfert I galaxies for which good images have already been obtained by ourselves and other observers. Our plan is to observe in two periods separated by about 3 months the following set of Seyfert 1 galaxies: Fairall 9, NGC 3783, NGC 4151, NGC 5548, WN 509, and NGC 7469. Depending on how our observing time is assigned, we might also obtain single scans of 3C120, WN 1095, WN 79.|Y
QSEWS|Coordinated Ultraviolet, Optical & Infrared Observations of High-Redshift Quasars|Wallace L.|Sargent|Cal Tech|The ultraviolet continuum of quasars is dominated by an optically thick thermal component, at a characteristic temperature of 20--30,000 K. It probably arises from gas accreting onto the central engine. Since the thermal flux peaks in the ultraviolet, I. U. E. observations are required to measure the complete spectral distribution. We propose to observe high-redshift quasars, to measure the continuum down to a rest wavelength of 400. We will determine the temperature distribution of the accreting gas, including the maximum temperature, and we will see if the infrared power-law extends all the way to the soft X-rays. Simultaneous optical and infrared observations will be made at Palomar.|Y

Our ultraviolet observations during May/June 1982 have discovered variability of the B component on a time scale of one month. Continued measurements of this object will provide the broadest possible frequency base to monitor flux variations in the components and to constrain models of the intervening galaxy and cluster which act as a gravitational lens causing the double image.|Y

By taking into account the line spectrum as well, we hope to derive the underlying continuum, and by comparison with other data already available over this wide wavelength range, we hope to gain insight into the relative contributions of different processes affecting the continuum, such as power law(s) from synchrotron processes, possible thermal contributions, etc. We have attempted this procedure for existing optical/IUE spectra, but in many cases there is uncertainty due to probable variation of the continuum with time. We expect the results to have implications for the nature of the quasars' energy source.|Y
QSFCW|UV Observations of Low Redshift Quasars|Chi-Chao|Wu|CSC|Our previous observations of Type 1 Seyfert galaxies have revealed important differences between the emission line properties of Seyfert I's and high redshift quasars. We propose to obtain high signal-to-noise pseudotrailed spectra for seven low redshift quasars in order to perform detailed comparisons with our existing spectra of similar high quality for Seyfert I galaxies. We wish to investigate if the morphological distinction of "Seyferts" and "quasars" has any physical meaning and to explore whether the phenomena we observe for active galaxies can be explained by a limited number of parameters, e.g. evolutionary stage, luminosity, radio properties or Fe II emission strength, etc. High quality spectra will give not only the strengths of prominent lines, but also their detailed profiles and the strengths of weak emission and absorption lines.

Fe II emission between 2280 and 2650A and the line ratios of the prominent lines serve as important diagnostic tools for the density, structure (high and low excitation regions, X-ray heating, etc.) and ionization parameters of the broad line clouds.|Y
QSFDT|Lyman Continuum Observations of Broad Absorption Line Qsos|David A.|Turnshek|Pittsburgh|Recent studies utilizing objective prism techniques indicate that a significant fraction of all QSOs have broad absorption lines in their spectra. There is no doubt that the absorbing clouds are associated with the QSO. The observed level of ionization in the absorbing clouds is very high and this leads to extremely tight constraints on the possible form Lyman continuum energy distribution if the level of ionization in the absorbing clouds is due to photoionization. UV observations with IUE are required so that a measurement of the shape and absolute flux of the Lyman continuum can be made. Absorption details in the continuum are not under study. These measurements will allow us to: (1) test the photoionization theory (which is in doubt), (ii) place constraints on the quantity ner^2 (which is important for deciding if substantial thermal line emission is arising in the broad absorbing clouds)|Y

Partly, this will involve processing IUE spectra in a two-dimensional mode,|Y
QSFGF|Ultraviolet and Optical Observations of 3C 120|Gary J.|Ferland|Kentucky|We propose to obtain simultaneous optical and ultraviolet observations of the radio galaxy 3C 120. The spectrum is distinguished by rapid changes in the continuum luminosity which we intend to exploit to determine several characteristics of the emission line gas. Our goals are three-fold: first, variations in the ionizing continuum produce a direct change in the ionization parameter of the gas. The resulting changes in the relative intensities of the emission lines allow a differential comparison with photoionization models. By its nature such a comparison is more reliable than the absolute analysis which have been attempted in the past. Secondly, individual ultraviolet and optical lines are actually a composite with contributions from both the inner, dense, broad line region, and the outer, tenuous, narrow line region. Light travel time arguments suggest that, the luminosity of the narrow lines will remain constant while the broad line region gas closely follows the changes in the continuum. This dichotomy will allow us to determine the relative contributions of the narrow and broad line regions to individual ultraviolet lines. Lastly, the optical spectrum is characterized by anomalously strong He I lines, and a preliminary analysis of archival IUE data shows that the He II/L-alpha intensity ratio is much larger than expected. We will determine the He II 1640/4686 intensity ratio, which is influenced by both reddening and perhaps line trapping effects. All of these questions will provide insight into related problems in other active galactic nuclei.|Y
QSFGK|Hydrogen Line Ratios in Seyfert Galaxies and Low Redshift Quasars|Gerard A.|Kriss|Michigan|The most recent photoionization models for the broad line regions of quasars and Seyfert galaxies enhance the Balmer lines relative to Lyman-alpha via collisional excitation at large optical depths. The X-ray continuum provides the heating at these large optical depths, and the models predict a correlation between the Ly-alpha/H-alpha line ratio and the ratio of ionizing ultraviolet to soft X-ray luminosity (Luv/Lchi). The proposed observations will measure Ly-alpha/H-alpha line ratios in Seyfert galaxies and low redshift quasars that lie at the extremes of the X-ray to optical luminosity ratio distribution. These will be used with existing data to test the prediction that Ly-alpha/H-alpha correlates with L uv /Lchi.|Y

The observations at all frequencies will be simultaneous. These data will be used to define and restrict models of the emission mechanism of these objects.|Y
QSFRC|Hydrogen Line Ratios in the Narrow-Line Regions of Active Galaxies|Ross D.|Cohen|UC SD|Narrow-line radio galaxies and Seyfert 2 galaxies are active galaxies with very similar optical spectra. Both classes of objects have been little observed with the IUE. Although the narrow-line radio galaxies are not as bright as the Seyferts, the redshifts of more are high enough so that Ly-alpha is not contaminated by geocoronal La. Comparison of L-alpha/H-alpha with H-alpha/H-beta and H-beta/H-gamma in these two classes of galaxies will enable as to determine whether these ratios are consistent with case B recombination and reddening as believed, or whether more parameters are needed. This important problem should be much more easily studied in these narrow-line objects than in quasars and Seyfert galaxies because of the low densities and optical depths in the narrow-line region, relative to those in the broad-line region. The ultraviolet spectra of these two different types of narrow-line galaxies will also be compared as part of this project.|Y
QSFRG|High Dispersion Quasar Absorption Spectra|Richard F.|Green|Arizona|We propose to obtain high dispersion long wavelength camera spectra of one bright quasar. Its redshift is 1.334, making the Ly-alpha region accessible. Based on our low dispersion results, we estimate that we can detect unresolved lines of at least 75% central depth in four full shift exposures. The project is motivated by three scientific objectives. The first is to gain considerable leverage in measuring the change in space density with cosmic time of the optically thin Ly-alpha forest absorbing clouds. The second is to learn more about the metal abundances and excitations of two optically thick absorption systems observed in the object.The final goal is to study the change in equivalent width spectrum of Ly-alpha absorbers with redshift, with the IUE observations as the basis for proposed Space Telescope High Resolution Spectrograph studies.|Y
QSFRM|UV/Optical/IR Spectropolarimetry of Low and High Polarization Quasars|Richard L.|Moore|CIT|We propose to make IUE observations of a sample of both high and low polarization quasars. The observations of low polarization QSOs (LPQs) will be part of an intensive effort to simultaneously define the UV/optical/IR energy distribution and wavelength dependence of polarization of selected normal QSOs. Complete wavelength coverage is necessary to deconvolve the emission components and their polarizations. Our observations will allow a detailed analysis of the origin of the emission components and the structure of the central region of QSOs.  We also plan to observe several highly polarized QSOs (HPQs) with IUE. The limited IUE observations of HPQs to date show no evidence of the hard thermal component which dominates at short wavelengths in the low polarization QSOs. if HPQs and LPQs generate energy by the same mechanism. RPQs should have a hard thermal component detectable In the ultraviolet at minimum light. We have selected three HPQs to observe with IUE which are good candidates for detecting this component because they show a spectral flattening at the shortest optical wavelengths. If no thermal component is present, the beaming hypothesis can not account for the differences between highly polarized end normal QSOs.|Y
QSFRR|Lyman Alpha Observations of Seyfert 1.8 and 1.9 Galaxies|Richard J.|Rudy|Arizona|The Seyfert 1.8 and 1.9 galaxies are emission line objects characterized by strong, broad emission at H-alpha with little or no such broad-line emission present at H-alpha. The most straightforward explanation for this and that which was advanced by Osterbrock in the original paper describing these objects is that the broadline regions are heavily obscured by dust which steepens the Balmer decrement. However, a recent observation of P-alpha in V ZW 317, the galaxy with the largest broad H-alpha/H-beta ratio, failed to detect the strong P-alpha expected if the broad-line region was heavily reddened. An alternate explanation is offered by recent radiative transfer models which predict very steep Balmer decrements (H-alpha/H-beta < 25) for optically thick conditions but for optical depths much less than thought present in the broad-line regions of QSOs. However, such models also predict a strong Ly-alpha flux at these optical depths (1 <Ly-alpha/H-alpha < 10). Thus, Ly-alpha observations would provide a definitive test of a model which offers promise of explaining the behavior of these peculiar Seyfert galaxies.|Y
QSFRS|Analysis of Time Variability of Emission Lines in Seyfert 1 Galaxies as Found in IUE Data|Ronald E.|Stoner|Bowling Green University|In IUE observations we have made in the past two years, we have discovered time variations in the emission lines in the Seyfert 1 galaxies NGC 5548 and Fairall 9. In the case of NGC 5548, the time variability is qualitatively different from that in optical spectra of Seyfert 1 galaxies. Since they may be a strong clue to nature of the broad-line emitting regions in these objects, it is important to learn as much as possible about such time variations. We propose to search all of the existing high-quality IUE spectra of Seyfert I galaxies and quasars for significant time variability in the continuum and emission lines. We will analyze the line profiles using a twocomponent model, and this will allow us to parameterize the profiles and their time variations in a way well suited for testing the various theoretical models against the data. This description of the time variations will then be used to place constraints on the theoretical models|Y
QSFWS|Coordinated Observations of Variability in Bright Seyfert 1 Galaxies|Wallace L.|Sargent|CIT|Our work in the fourth and fifth years of IUE has provided the first direct evidence that most of the ultraviolet continuum in bright Seyfert 1 galaxies and quasars is optically thick thermal emission. Our interpretation of this emission as light from an accretion disk around a massive black hole gives remarkably good agreement with all the data. We propose to make simultaneous observations over a wide frequency span to study the variability of the thermal emission and its relation to the red non-thermal flux and the emission lines. Our eight program Seyfert 1 galaxies have been carefully selected to meet several requirements, including short exposure times, negligible starlight contamination and reddening, and detectable thermal continuum and known variability.|Y

These spectra will also allow more accurate measurements of weak spectral features: OI 1304 and He II 1640 are needed to estimate reddening; N IV] 1486, O III] 1663 and N III] 1749 are needed for abundance analyses; the Mg II 2800 absorption line can be used for estimating ,the covering factor of the broad line region (BLR); and Galactic absorption lines of Si II 1260, O I 1304, C II 1335 and Fe II 1608 can yield additional information on the Galactic halo. There are also broad features superposed on the spectra of Seyfert galaxies: the 2200A dust absorption feature, the emission hump at 3200A and the Fe II emission between 2280 and 2650A. Their detection, measurement and quantitative study also require spectra recorded with high signal-to-noise ratios. Xray fluxes are already available for some of the proposed targets, and these data will be combined with our UV continua to estimate the amounts of available ionizing radiation. We also plan to measure the fluxes of the prominent emission lines L-alpha, SI IV 1400, C IV 1550, C III] 1909 and Mg II 2800, to extend our investigation of the L-alpha/H-beta ratio and to provide a homogeneous set of high quality data to allow the evaluation of models for individual objects instead of, as in the past, for an assumed "typical" Seyfert or quasar. Our previous observations have revealed important differences between the emission line properties of Type 1 Seyferts and high redshift quasars. The results from these Seyferts will greatly strengthen our data base for further investigation.|Y
QSGAG|High Signal to Noise Studies of Intermediate Redshift Quasars|A. E.|Glassgold|New York Univerrsity|We propose to obtain IUE spectra of high S/N to observe the L-alpha, L-beta, OVI 1034, and OI 1304 emission lines in six intermediate redshift quasars. These data will allow us to determine the L-alpha profiles and the fluxes of the weaker lines, which have significant diagnostic potential for models of the emission line clouds. One important goal of the profile study is to measure the L-alpha/H-beta ratio for both the broad and narrow line components. The program includes extensive use of the IUE archives.|Y
QSGDT|Broad Absorption Line Qsos|David A.|Turnshek|Pittsburgh|Our main goal is to use the IUE to obtain Lyman continuum energy distributions for broad absorption line QSOs. This will allow us to test the validity of photoionization theory as applied to broad absorption line clouds as well as study the physical conditions in these clouds. In addition, we propose work with archival data to further study the Lyman continuum energy distribution of QSOs. We also propose to make a repeat observation of an edge-on Seyfert 1 galaxy (previously observed by us with IUE) to confirm the result that broad absorption lines are present.|Y
QSGHM|Ultraviolet Studies of Active Galactic Nuclei|H. Richard|Miller|Georgia State University|A study using IUE observations and existing optical observations of BL Lac Objects, OVV quasars, and Seyfert galaxies is proposed in an effort to study and understand the nature of the physical processes responsible for the polarized and variable continuum. The purpose of this proposed program is to study the optical/ultraviolet spectral index of the non thermal continuum for selected objects from each subgroup (i.e. BL Lac Objects, OVV quasars, and Seyfert galaxies). The goal is to determine if there is any correlation between flux level (i.e. is the object in a faint or bright phase), variability, and possible variations in the spectral index.|Y
QSGJO|IUE Observations of Variable Type 1 Seyfert Galaxies|John Beverly|Oke|Cal Tech|It is proposed to continue obtaining IUE observations of three luminous highly variable Type I Seyfert galaxies 3C 120, 3C 382, and 3C 390.3. All of these objects have been observed in past years with IUE and also are being monitored from the ground on a regular basis. Since most of the interesting CV lines are covered with the short wavelength camera, only short wavelength camera spectra will be obtained. Since changes in the broad lines are known to occur in less than one year, it is proposed to observe the objects twice during the year. Using IUE and visual data, it should be possible to show (1) whether the broad line region is expanding, contracting, or rotating, (2) how large the region is, and (3) whether the region is more nearly like a disk or a thick shell.|Y
QSGMB|Studies of Global H II Regions in Seyfert Galaxies|Mitchell C.|Begelman|Colorado - JILA|We propose to use IUE archive data on four Seyfert galaxies (NGC-1068, NGC-4151, 3C-120, and NGC3516) to detect and study absorption lines arising from interstellar gas in the parent galaxies. Much of the gas is expected to be photoionized by continuum radiation from the active galactic nucleus on scales of 2-10 kpc. Such "global H II regions" have been detected optically in 3C-120 and NGC-3516 and are characterized by high levels of ionization and excitation. We will therefore search for absorption lines of such species as C IV, Si III and Si IV, as well as those associated with "normal" H II regions. Theoretical considerations suggest that these global H II regions should have chaotic velocity fields with dispersions of several hundred kilometers per second, which will be detectable on low-resolution spectra.  The nuclei of all four target galaxies are highly variable, and have been monitored extensively with IUE. By stacking the many spectra of each object, we expect to be able to separate any time-independent absorption arising on kiloparsec scales, from variable absorption due to gas near the nucleus. The stacking technique will also improve the signal to noise ratio, and enhance our ability to detect weak lines.|Y
QSGMK|EUV Lines of High Redshift QSO's and the Future of EUV Astronomy|Minas|Kafatos|George Mason University|We plan to undertake an archival study of high redshift quasars (z > 0.65) to identify emission lines in the EUV range. Possible such lines are the He I, Ne V, Ne VI, Ne VII, Ne VIII, O II, O III, C II lines at  588, 358.9, 401.7, 465.2, 773.7, 833.8, 834.5, 858.4 and 904.1, respectively We will also search for possible troughs of the He I resonance line at 588 A and ionization edge at 504 A for the purpose of studying the intergalactic medium. These studies will prove extremely useful in understanding the EUV flux from quasars and their contribution to an EUV background flux. Moreover, our proposed research will demonstrate the viability of future EUV astronomy with the proposed FUSE satellite. Our previous IUE archival study of absorption features in the spectra of intermediate redshift QSO's yielded successful emission line identifications in the wavelength region above 730 A. The present study will extend our past work to a spectral region where little is known or understood.|Y
QSGMM|Coordinated IUE and Ground-Based Observations of Bright Variable Seyfert 1 Galaxies|Matthew A.|Malkan|Arizona|Last year we began to collect simultaneous (within a week) ultraviolet, optical, and infrared spectrophotometry of bright variable Seyfert 1 galaxies. Hardly any simultaneous multiwavelength observations had been made in IUE's first five years. Our data will, for the first time, permit the study of variability of individual continuum components. For example, we will measure the variations in the nonthermal power-law, and the Balmer line and continuum emission, and their relation to the optically thick thermal component which produces most of the ultraviolet excess (Malkan and Sargent 1982). If the ultraviolet emission comes from an accretion disk (Malkan 1983), its variability gives critical information about viscosity and the vertical structure of the disk. We will also compare the simultaneous ultraviolet and optical emission-line strengths and profiles. We have measured the reddening and starlight contamination in all of our program objects, and they are small effects. This variability study requires at least three or four sets of observations, and we can complete the program this year.|Y
QSGRC|Physical Conditions in Narrow-Line Radio Galaxies and       Seyfert 2 Galaxies|Ross|Cohen|University of California|Narrow-line radio galaxies and Seyfert 2 galaxies are active galaxies with very similar optical spectra. Both classes of objects (particularly the radio galaxies) have been little observed with the IUE. Comparison of L-alpha/H-alpha with H-alpha/H-beta and H-beta/H-gamma in these two classes of galaxies will enable us to determine whether these ratios are consistent with case B recombination and reddening as believed, or whether more parameters are needed. This important problem should be much more easily studied in these narrow-line objects than in quasars and Seyfert 1 galaxies because of the low densities and optical depths in the narrow-line region, relative to those in the broad-line region. The ultraviolet spectra of these two different types of narrow-line galaxies will also be compared as part of this project.|Y
QSGRG|Quasars at Redshift 1|Richard|Green|Steward Univ and Kitt Peak Observatory|We propose to continue our long-term program of studying the far ultraviolet spectra of high redshift quasars. our target list consists of three PG quasars, all with V ~16.0 and redshifts between 1.1 and 1.5. The observations are prompted by three scientific objectives. The first is to expand our survey for optically thick Lyman edge absorption systems to extend our study of intervening galactic halo regions at high redshift. Our sample to date has yielded a different range of associated C IV and Mg II column densities from those found in optical absorptionline surveys. Secondly, the objects at redshift 1 are less subject to optically thin Lyman continuum absorption distributed along the line of sight, so that more reliable inferences may be drawn about the intrinsic emitted continuum than in their higher redshift counterparts. We will use Malkan's fitting technique to derive black hole masses and accretion rates for various assumptions about the opacity-induced curvature. Finally, the asymmetries in the Ly-alpha emission line profile will be compared with those in high resolution C IV and C III] profiles measured optically, and interpreted in the context of models for the broad emission line region. Further physical constraints will be provided by emission lines with wavelengths shorter than Ly-alpha.|Y
QSGRP|Time Variability of Emission Line Profiles in Seyfert 1 Galaxies|Roger L.|Ptak|Bowling Green University|Previous IUE observations have established that broad emission lines in Seyfert galaxies vary on time scales of weeks to months, and that both the Intensity and the profiles of these lines participate in the variations. Since the profiles are a record of the kinematic behavior of the emitting gas, a study of their time variability has great potential for revealing the dynamics of the emitting gas In the nuclear region. Only the most meager information about profile variability can be obtained if the individual images are noisy or if only a few good spectra are available for a given object, and this is unfortunately true in most cases. We propose to obtain additional long-exposure, pdeudotralled IUE Images of the brightest and most variable Seyfert i galaxies for continuing analysis of the physical nature of their nuclear regions.|Y
QSGRS|Tests of a Model for Seyfert 1 Emission Profiles|Ronald E.|Stoner|Bowling Green|Our analysis of two spectra of the Seyfert I galaxy NGC 4151 that were obtained In previous IUE observation runs has suggested a new geometry for the broad line emission region (BLR) of this galaxy, that of a uniformly expanding, turbulent shell. Our analysis Indicates that the profile of the bright emission line CIV 1550 In this object consists of a constant narrow core superposed on a time-variable broad component whose characteristic shape Is a result of the expanding shell geometry. So far as we are aware, this is the first detailed model to successfully explain the timevariability In emission lines In Seyfert galaxies and quasars. We propose here to carry out three IUE archival analysis projects: First, to search for and quantify time variations In integrated intensities and profiles of the Important emission lines for approximately 45 IUE archival Images, second to use the large number of archival Images of NGC 4151 and the expanding shell geometry to trace the physical changes In the BLR during past periods of rapid variability, and, third, to test the same model against emission profiles from other bright Seyfert I galaxies that exhibit variability In their line emission profiles.|Y
QSHAG|Line Variability of the Luminous Quasar 3C446|A. E.|Glassgold|New York University|In another IUE program we discovered that the L-alpha line and UV continuum of 3C 446 vary together on time scales of 0.5 to 2.0 years. This result is unexpected in the standard photoionization model where the broad line clouds of a luminous quasar such as 3C 446 are almost a light decade distant from the continuum source. The most likely explanation of this result is that the clouds are clustered on the near side of the quasar. We propose to measure this effect at higher signal to noise and on shorter time scales of the order of a week in order to obtain more detailed information on the spatial distribution and kinematics of the broad line emission clouds.|Y
QSHBW|An Investigation of a Peculiar High Luminosity Quasar|Beverley J.|Wills|Texas|We propose co-ordinated IUE - McDonald Observatory - IRTF (NASA's Infra-red Telescope Facility) observations of the continuum energy distribution and line spectrum of the high luminosity quasar, 3C 232. 3C 232 is especially interesting because it is extreme in many respects that are not, with our present knowledge, obviously related, but which by their extremeness in the one object, suggest that they are indeed related. We hope that these observations will allow Us to investigate how. The understanding of this object could well have important implications for the understanding of the other >99% run-of-the-mill quasars.|Y
QSHCH|Extended Exposures of a Bright Quasar at Redshift 3.7|Cyril|Hazard|Pittsburgh|We have discovered a uniquely bright (B ~17.0) quasar of very high redshift (z ~ 3.7). It's extremely blue continuum makes it an ideal candidate for IUE observations. With combined transatlantic double shifts with the LWP and SWP cameras, we can detect the continuum down to a restwavelength of 260A. This would extend our knowledge of the high frequency spectra of quasars another octave, in the critical ionizing ultraviolet. Even more importantly it would allow us for the first time to detect HeII 304 A resonance line absorption from the intergalactic medium.|Y
QSHCW|Observations of Low Redshift Quasars|Chi-Chao|Wu|CSC|Our previous observations of Type I Seyfert galaxies have revealed important differences between the emission line properties of Seyfert 1's and high redshift quasars. We propose to obtain high signal-to-noise pseudo-trailed spectra for low redshift quasars in order to perform detailed comparisons with our existing spectra of similar high quality for Seyfert I galaxies. We wish to investigate if the morphological distinction of "Seyferts" and "quasars" has any physical meaning and to explore whether the phenomena we observe for active galaxies can be explained by a limited number of parameters, e.g., evolutionary stage, luminosity, radio properties or Fe II emission strength, etc. High quality spectra will give not only the strengths of prominent lines, but also their detailed profiles and the strengths of weak emission and absorption lines. Line profiles and asymmetries provide information on the dynamics and stratification of physical conditions of the broad line region (BLR); and the location of opacity source(s). Weak emission lines such as O I 1304 and He II 1640 and the 2200A broad absorption feature are needed to estimate reddening; N IV) 1486, O III] 1663 and N III] 1749 are needed for abundance analyses; and Mg II absorption can be used to estimate the covering factor. Fe II emission between 2280 and 2650A and the ratios of the prominent lines serve as important diagnostic tools for the density, structure (high and low excitation regions, X-ray heating, etc.) and ionization parameters of the broad line clouds.|Y
QSHDT|PG1700+518: A Low Redshift Broad Absorption Line Qso|David A.|Turnshek|STScI|We wish to obtain a single observation of the BAL QSO PG1700+518 in the LWP camera. The main purpose is to measure the amount of FeII emission 0 in the 2670 - 3050 A region. This corresponds to 2070 2360 A in the QSO rest frame. It is suspected that strong FeII emission occurs when the BAL region level of ionization is lower than normal. This object is one of only two BAL QSOs that has MgII BALs and thus a lower level of ionization.|Y
QSHDY|CIV/MGII and the Ionization in QSO Absorption Line Systems|Donald G.|York|Chicago|The statistics of the incidence of QSO's absorption from the CIV and MgII doublets suggest a change in the nature of the absorbers around a redshift z=1 We propose to observe CIV in known MgII systems (z=0.5 to 1) and to use the data at all z's to study the ionization in the QSO's metal absorbers which may prove to be a powerful tool in understanding their nature, their evolution, their relation to galaxies and to the intergalactic medium over a wide range of redshifts.|Y
QSHEJ|Intergalactic Lyman Alpha Systems|Edward B.|Jenkins|Princeton University|Ultraviolet observations of QSO'S using IUE can improve our understanding of intervening absorption line systems which appear in the spectra of high z objects at visible wave lengths. We have 2 principle objectives: 1) We propose to continue our study of lines of sight which pass within a few hundred kpc of identifiable galaxies to verify the interpretation that many high z systems originate from the outermost extensions of their halos.  2) We intend to measure the density of Ly-alpha absorption clouds at low z to better understand bow the systems which produce the lines evolve.  Specifically, we will determine the number of Ly-alpha absorption lines at 2 values in the range of 0.2 - 1.0 for comparison with ground based studies of these lines at z = 1.8 - 3.5. From our earlier IUE studies we have found some evidence that this number changes dramatically from z = 2 to z = 0.2, with implications for models of the intergalactic medium. We have shown from our previous work that we can achieve 200 - 300 mA sensitivities. This UV detection limit is the same as that used in ground based studies of Ly-alpha lines. Finally, we stress that we have successfully identified in IUE spectra of our QSO's absorption lines originating in intervening, identifiable galaxies.|Y
QSHMM|Coordinated UV/Optical/IR Observations of Polarized Quasars|Matthew A.|Malkan|UCLA|We have been measuring the wavelength-dependence of polarization to study the continuum emission of active galactic nuclei. Our list of targets is limited by the requirement that the polarizations at U, B, V, R, and I are measured with high accuracy. One bright Seyfert galaxy, Mrk 290, has simultaneous ultraviolet/optical/infrared spectrophotometry. We fitted the multi-wavelength continuum with thermal models which we have successfully applied to previous IUE quasar observations (Malkan 1983). The accretion disk flux determined by these fits rises from the red into the blue in exactly the same way as does the measured polarized flux. The agreement of these two independent sets of data indicates that the accretion disk light has a constant polarization of 3.5%, at a constant position angle of 146 degrees. This result is expected for a tilted disk where electron scattering dominates its opacity. we have similar good polarimetry for 6 more PG quasars, none of which have yet been observed by IUE. We need the same combination of polarimetric and simultaneous ultraviolet/optical/infrared continuum data to look for similar effects in these quasars. When the data are compared with the model predictions they will provide critical information about the structure and geometry of the thermal continuum-emitting region.|Y
QSHRG|Quasars and Galactic Halo Evolution|Richard F.|Green|Aura|We propose to study the dynamical and chemical evolution of distant galactic halos by using quasar continua as background probes to observe this nonluminous matter in absorption. Recent evidence from a combination of IUE and ground-based studies indicates that distant halos show a more complex velocity structure with higher total dispersion than the Galaxy's halo, as well as a stronger high ionization component. By observing quasars in the redshift range from 1 to 2, we expect to establish the cosmic epoch which marks the change in typical halo properties from the simple local systems to the more complex distant systems. By discovering Lyman limit absorptions against the continua of these intermediate redshift quasars, we are led to metal absorption line systems observed optically with lower metal column densities than we would pick up in an equivalent width limited survey. Within the context of a photoionization model, we will then interpret the results to find temperatures, densities, ionizations, depletions, and abundances in these clouds as a function of cosmic epoch. The evolution of galactic absorption cross-section and the difference between Lyman limit systems and other high ionization systems will be systematically investigated.  An additional valuable result will be the quasar continuum flux distributions themselves. When combined with optical spectrophotometry and X-ray fluxes, they can be modeled with a combination of an accretion disk continuous emission spectrum, distorted by internal reddening. The total power in this "thermal" component can then be estimated to yield the central mass and accretion rate in the central engine.|Y
QSIEJ|Intergalactic Lyman Alpha Systems|Edward B.|Jenkins|Princeton University|Ultraviolet observations of QSOs using IUE can improve our understanding of intervening absorption line systems which appear in the spectra of high-z objects at visible wavelengths. We have two principal objectives: [1] We propose to continue our study of lines of sight which pass within a few hundred kpc of identifiable galaxies to verify the interpretation that many high-z systems originate from the outermost extensions of their halos.  [2] We intend to measure the density of L-alpha absorption clouds at low z to better understand how the systems which produce the lines evolve.  Specifically, we will determine the number of L-alpha absorption lines at z values in the range of 0.2 1.0 for comparison with ground based studies of these lines at 1.6 < z < 3.5. A preliminary conclusion from the data we have so far is that the downward trend for N(L-alpha) seen in the visible does not continue into the uv. Using special data reduction techniques, we expect to achieve sensitivities down to 0.5A in the rest frame - a threshold only about 2 to 3 times less sensitive than groundbased studies of intergalactic L-alpha absorption lines. Finally, we note that intervening galaxies do not seem to exhibit conspicuous lines in our spectra obtained so far but further confirmation is needed.|Y
QSIMM|The Bluest Quasars: Spectral Energy Distributions Extending Below the Lyman Limit|Matthew A.|Malkan|UCLA|We propose to study the intrinsic energy distributions of five of the bluest known quasars, with complete observations extending from 10 micron through the ultraviolet, down to wavelengths below the Lyman limit at 912A. Quasar energy distributions, as measured in Vfv, rise down to a wavelength of around 1500A and must peak somewhere between 1200A and around NO (Figure 1). The exact shape of the peak is currently one of the most crucial questions in quasar continuum studies. The central frequency and width of this energy peak are not yet well determined due to the absorption and reddening along the line-of-sight. The reddenings are caused by the dust in the Milky Way and in the quasar host galaxy while the absorption is primarily due to intergalactic neutral hydrogen. By focusing on quasars with the bluest colors, intermediate redshifts (0.35 < Z < 1.3), and high-galactic latitudes (|b| > 30), our study will determine the intrinsic far-UV continuum fluxes with greater reliability than previous work.  In our coming optical observing runs at Lick Observatory in January/February 1986, we will measure the sample of all 20 bright (B < 16.5), intermediate redshift quasars which have not been observed by IUE previously (Table 1). The optical colors will allow us to select the bluest five, which we can be confident are essentially unreddened. We request five US 1 shifts to observe these five bluest quasars to measure the central frequency and width of the energy peak to derive better estimates of the complete quasar energy budget, the ionizing flux spectrum, and to test hypotheses on the origin of the continuum.|Y
QSIRG|Quasars and Galactic Halo Evolution|Richard F.|Green|Arizona|We propose to study the dynamical and chemical evolution and history of star formation in distant galactic halos by using quasar continua as background probes to observe this non-luminous matter in absorption. Recent evidence from a combination of IUE and ground-based studies indicates that distant halos show a more complex velocity structure with higher total dispersion than the Galaxy's halo, as well as a stronger high ionization component. By observing quasars in the redshift range from 1 to 2, we expect to establish the cosmic epoch which marks the change in typical halo properties from the simple local systems to the more complex distant systems. By discovering Lyman limit absorptions against the continua of these intermediate redshift quasars, we are led to metal absorption line systems observed optically with lower metal column densities than we would pick up in an equivalent width limited survey. Within the context of a photoionization model, we will then interpret the results to find temperatures, densities, ionizations, depletions, and abundances in these clouds as a function of cosmic epoch. The evolution of galactic absorption cross-section and the difference between Lyman limit systems and other high ionization systems will be systematically investigated, especially within an interpretation of the lower ionization systems as associated with regions of active star formation.  An additional valuable result will be the quasar continuum flux distributions themselves. One of the major uncertainties in our model of the ambient ionizing photon flux is the shape of the quasar continuum in the EUV These quasars at redshift 1 allow detections of rest frame flux down to 600 A in the rest frame, providing an important sampling of that ionizing flux, and constraining the range of accretion disk model parameters. This proposal, if accepted, would make the completion of the IUE survey of high redshift objects from the Palomar Bright Quasar Survey.|Y
QSIRR|UV/Optical Spectrophotometry of Seyfert 1.8/1.9 Galaxies|Richard J.|Rudy|Aerospace Corp.|The Seyfert 1.8 and 1.9 galaxies are characterized by faint broad components to the Balmer lines, large broad-line Balmer documents, weak optical Fe II emission and a small nonstellar continuum. Although these feature suggest reddening of the broad line region (BLR) and the central continuium source, recent studies, primarily in the ultraviolet, indicate that these active galaxies are low luminosity objects in which smaller optical depths than are believed typical for the broad line regions of Seyfert 1 galaxies are primarily responsible for the unusual line ratios. Our principal goal for this project is to study conditions within the BLR for these objects. The strong UV lines that can be measured by IUE, particularly Ly-alpha and Mg II, are critical for such a study; also important is an accurate assessment of the ultraviolet continuum. In addition, we will attempt to observe a variable Seyfert 1.8 or 1.9 galaxies (as determined from our two epochs of optical measurements) to study continuum variability, and, from variations in the line profiles, kinematics of the line emitting gas.|Y
QSIRS|Emission Profiles and Continuum of Seyfert 1 Galaxies|Ronald E.|Stoner|Bowling Green|A previous archival study of time variability in the IUE spectra of three Seyfert I galactic nuclei has shown that both the variability of the continuum, the variability in the net intensity of the prominent CIV 1550 emission line, and the high-state profile of this line are consistent with origin in a single, spherical opaque object surrounded by a spherical, expanding, lineemitting shell. The radius of one of these (in NGC 4151) inferred from the high-state emission profile is the same as that independently inferred from fitting of a black-body spectrum to the ultraviolet continuum, and corresponds to an opaque core with radius of about 10" cm; this is the approximate radius of a supermassive star containing 106 solar masses. Further, the energy production of a hydrogen-burning massive star of this radius would be sufficient to provide the kinetic energy for the explosive mass loss implied by the line profile. We request funds for continued archival studies of bright and variable Seyfert I galaxies to further test the viability of this model of AGNs by extending the analysis to other emission lines, other objects and a few simultaneous optical spectra.|Y
QSJGM|Bright High-Redshift Bal Quasar|Gordon|McAlpine|Michigan|I and a graduate student have recently discovered a new highredshift broadabsorption-line (BAL) quasar with unusually strong, well-defined spectral absorption features and which is bright enough for observation with IUE. Knowledge of certain characteristics measurable with the LWP camera is necessary for accurate assessments of absorbing gas ionization conditions and chemical abundances. In addition, detection of strong HeI 584 emission has recently been reported for another BAL quasar, suggesting gas characteristics very different from those deduced for non-BAL quasars. In order to understand the quasar phenomenon in general, it is necessary that we understand the relationship between BAL and non-BAL cases. For instance, do line emission and absorption come from the same gas? Are BAL and non-BAL quasars the same phenomena, seen from different aspect angles? Objectives of this proposal are to detect and measure the ultraviolet features required to help answer these questions, to analyze the responsible gas, and to predict additional BAL quasar spectral characteristics at far ultraviolet wavelengths which may ultimately be observed with the Space Telescope.|Y
QSJJS|IUE, Voyager 2 & Groundbased Spectrophotometry of PG 1211 + 143|John T.|Stocke|Colorado - CASA|PG 1211+143 is unique among bright, QSOs in possessing an extremely strong UV and soft x-ray flux. At z=0.085 and V=14.8, this QSO is significantly fainter than 3C273 in the optical but may be as bright or brighter than 3C273 at 1 Rydberg. Besides having the highest x-ray to optical flux ratio of any bright QSO, the soft x-ray slope of PG 1211+143 is significantly steeper than any other QSO yet measured (alpha =2.2 compared to <alpha>=1.0; Elvis, etal., 1986). A simpleminded, single temperature black-body fit to the existing optical, IUE and Einstein IPC data suggest art accretion disk model which is accreting at a highly super-Eddington rate. However, the current data do not constrain the model well enough to prove this contention because the crucial spectral region lies just beyond the IUE SWP range BUT within the range of the Voyager 2 UVS! We therefore propose quasi-simultaneons IUE, Voyager 2 and ground-based spectrophotometry of this bright QSO in order to further constrain the accretion disk models of QSOs. The IUE observations are crucial to this research because: (1). there is not enough spectral coverage within the Voyager UVS range to define the continuum flux level and slope in the 1 Rydberg regime and (2). the strengths of the bright emission lines within the IUE band provide a further constraint on the physical. model of this QSO.|Y
QSJMM|Multi-Wavelength Spectra of a Complete Sample of Bright Quasars|Matthew A.|Malkan|UCLA|We propose to study the ultraviolet/optical/infrared energy distributions of all 46 members of the Bright Quasar Survey which have MB < -25.5. This requires 6 US 1 shifts in which we will use IUE's SWP and LWP cameras to observe the 6 quasars with no previous ultraviolet spectra. The redshift (0.334 < Z < 1.920) will facilitate measurements of the critical ionizing -continuum shortward of Lyman limit (912A) with IUE. The UV spectra will be combined with existing (and new) optical spectrophotometry and near/mid-IR photometry to form composite spectra from 1200A to 10-100 microns.  After the small effects of intergalactic absorption and dust reddening are accounted for, we will fit the multi-wavelength spectra with our newly-improved accretion disk models. We will search for the Lyman limit absorption edge which is predicted in our models of disks viewed at low inclination angles.  We will also use the complete sample to search for correlations between continuum properties and several proposed indicators of accretion disk inclination, including the width, strength and smoothness of broad emission line profiles, ratios of forbidden to permitted lines, white-light polarizations, soft X-ray fluxes, and radio fluxes and morphologies.|Y
QSJRG|Quasar Euv Continua|Richard F.|Green|Kitt Peak|We propose to reobserve the two quasars that have yielded unambiguous detections of continuum flux at the shortest rest wavelengths. They are Ton 34, at redshift 1.92, and the triple quasar PG 1115+08, at redshift 1.72. Neither of these objects had very high optical depth Lyman limit absorbers along the line of sight, so that the continuum was marginally detected down to 420 A and 450 A in the rest frames.  There are three Important reasons to obtain spectra with better signal to noise for these objects. The first is that they both sample the He I ionization absorption limit from the emission redshift down to z = 1.45. Better signal will put tighter limits on the neutral helium component of the diffuse intergalactic medium and the known Ly-alpha and metal systems along the line of sight. Secondly, the slope of the EUV continuum Is a critical input to accretion disk models to obtain the central mass and accretion rate. The observed spectrum must be corrected for weaker Lyman limit absorptions explicitly to obtain the emitted energy distribution, which is possible only with sufficient signal to distinguish true edges from the noise. Finally, there Is a suggestion in the original IUE spectrum that the triple quasar contains a Lyman limit absorption near redshift 0.65, which would be a highly plausible location for the hitherto undetected lensing object.|Y
QSKAK|An Atlas of Low-Dispersion QSO Spectra|Anne L.|Kinney|STScI|This proposal is part of our larger project to construct an ultraviolet spectral Atlas of low redshift QSOs, using low resolution spectra in the IUE Archive. Our intent is to produce a high quality compilation, with spectra having the best attainable signal-to-noise ratios, that can be used for detailed photometric and spectral line analyses. The purpose of this Atlas is to facilitate research on the QSOs themselves as well as their absorption line phenomena. Work on this Atlas is being supported through SADAP and is well in hand.  In this observing request we propose to observe several objects for the Quasar Atlas with a redshift of about 1.0, a redshift region for which the IUE Archives has only two QSOs with multiple exposures. This redshift region is very important for absorption phenomena such as the number density of intervening HI clouds and for Lyman continuum phenomena. We anticipate that the Atlas will become an important reference source for future ultraviolet studies of these objects, especially with the Hubble Space Telescope.|Y
QSKBW|The QSO, IRAS 13349+2438: Unique or Typical?|Beverley J.|Wills|Texas|It is the strength of the mid-infrared spectrum that really singles out IRAS 13349+2438 (IRQ) from among other Active Galactic Nuclei, but it is also the most luminous QSO to show high, wavelength dependent polarization and, apparently, quite large line and continuum reddening. Based on optical and IR measurements, we have proposed a model for this object, consisting of a disk partially obscuring the nucleus, with electrons or small dust grains in the polar directions that polarize and scatter a relatively unreddened nuclear spectrum toward the observer. This model, which is like others suggested for IR-luminous, polarized Seyfert galaxies, suggests that the observed properties of IRQ are likely to depend on viewing angle and so this object may provide an important observational link between apparently different classes of AGN. It may also provide a link between the most luminous IRAS galaxies that could harbor almost completely dust-enshrouded QSOs and the most luminous, least dusty QSOs. The proposed IUE observations will provide a test of our model, and the suggested evolutionary and/or inclination-dependent links with other kinds of AGN and QSOs, through observations of line and continuum reddening due to dust (including a strong expected 2200A feature), blueing due to Rayleigh-type scattering, and a search for broad absorption lines.|Y
QSKCG|The Unique FE II Emitting Quasars in IC 2943 and Mark 957|C. Martin|Gaskell|Michigan|Observations are sought of two low-redshift quasars which are unusual in two respects: they have extremely narrow broad lines (FWHMs of 420 and 470 km/sec) and unusually weak Balmer lines. They also appear to have exceptionally strong Fe II emission compared with the Balmer lines (but this is entirely because the Balmer lines are suppressed and the Fe II emission is "normal"). Prior to being granted two shifts (out of a requested 6) in the current (10th) year, no UV spectra had been obtained for any such quasars and a major question addressed in this research is whether these quasars are normal in their UV properties. The indication from the one SWP spectrum obtained to date in "No". I am aiming to find out why these quasars are so unusual in their kinematics and physical conditions. Some specific predictions are being tested. First it was predicted that they might be broad absorption line quasars (the first one looked at with SWP looks like it could be but a confirming spectrum is required). If this proves to be so it will almost double the known number of low redshift broad absorption line quasars and provide an important link between emission line and absorption line properties. There is also a prediction in the literature that these quasars will show a high Si III]/C III] ratio indicating an unusually high density and this can obviously be tested (but the time allocated this year was insufficient to get LWR spectra). There are two classes of model for producing the puzzling low ionization clouds in quasars (i.e. those producing Fe II), models which produce Fe II in the same clouds that give the high ionization lines (the so called "standard model") and models which produce it in radically different clouds (the model I favor myself). The standard model would predict that Lyman-alpha should be extremely weak and unresolved with the IUE. This seems to be the case for the one SWP spectrum taken so far, although (again) because of the low SIN a confirming spectrum is needed. The Ly-alpha/C IV/C III] ratio will be an important diagnostic of conditions. It is also predicted that Mg II will be suppressed (this obviously needs LWR spectra). All of these questions can be readily answered with IUE spectra and progress made in understanding gas at the very centers of quasars.|Y
QSKDT|Low Redshift Broad Absorption Line QSOs|David A.|Turnshek|STScI|We propose to obtain observations of low redshift examples of Broad Absorption Line (BAL) QSOs in the eleventh year as a continuation of our approved tenth year program. In the total program four different lines of research concerning DAL QSOs are addressed: (1) We are studying in more detail than previously possible the DAL profiles of three low redshift objects already known with certainty to be DAL QSOs. The aim is to obtain improved signal-tonoise ratio data which will allow an improved assessment of the DAL kinematics and more accurate column densities of C^+3 Si^+3, N^-4 and Ho to be determined. This can be used to model ionization mechanisms and abundances. The latter analysis will have important implications for constraints on DAL region (BALR) size scale and DAL QSO host galaxy types which are also being investigated in detail via ground-based imaging studies. (2) We also use archival data and a new observation to confirm (or refute) our interpretation that two other QSOs which have been previously studied with IUE in the CIV, SiIV, NV and Ly-alpha region are low redshift BAL QSOs. Assuming these two objects are confirmed to be DAL QSOs. these data will be sufficient to study the DAL kinematics and column densities. These data are also important because they improve our knowledge of the fraction of QSOs with BALs at low redshifts. Finding such objects now is particularly important because it paves the way for future imaging studies both from the ground and in space. Lastly, we are studying the AlIII/CIII]-FeII-MgII region. This will be used to: (3) determine if MgII BALs exist to limits which are nearly as sensitive as those obtained for higher redshift DAL QSOs from the ground and (4) extract emission line property and profile data which will permit comparison of the properties at low and high redshift and comparison of emission line profiles from far UN' (Ly-alpha) to optical red (Ha) wavelengths in the individual objects. Note that if MgII BALs are present in these low redshift BAL QSOs, it would be particularly important because it would indicate that the BALRs of QSOs have systematically lower ionization at low redshifts. In some reasonable scenarios this would have profound implications for the evolutionary history of QSOs. Evidence for lower ionization at low redshifts would also impact the constraints on level of ionization and BALR size scale. In terms of emission line properties, it is important to assess if, for example. FeII emission in enhanced in low redshift DAL QSOs as it appears to be enhanced in the high redshift ones. Comparing the emission line profiles of a variety of spieces; from the UV to red wavelengths is also important, since BAL QSOs may be simply normal QSOs that are being looked at along a special line of sight (e.g. along the plane of a disk in which DAL material is distributed). Thus, comparison of the different emission line profiles of DAL QSOs may empirically permit the tightest constraints to be placed on models for the QSO emission line regions in terms of deciding where (spatially and kinematically) the different emission line region components arise.|Y
QSKDY|QSO Absorption Lines|Donald G.|York|Chicago|Absorption lines in spectra of QSO's at redshifts, z, lower than Z emission, are thought to arise in intervening galaxies. Whether these galaxies are like present day galaxies, perhaps with extended halos, or are active star forming galaxies is now an open question; examples of galaxies, associated with the QSO absorption lines, fitting both descriptions have recently been found.  High resolution UV profiles of halo sight-lines and of star burst regions can be compared directly with (redshifted) profiles of QSO absorption lines to intercompare gas densities, element abundances and ambient radiation fields to see which region is most similar to the QSO absorbers. We propose to obtain multiple spectra of 3C273 and M83 (nucleus) for this purpose.|Y
QSKMM|Coordinated Observations of Seyfert 1 Galaxies and Quasars|Matthew A.|Malkan|UCLA|Until the shuttle flight of the Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope, the Voyager far ultraviolet spectrometer (UVS) is the only instrument capable of observing the wavelength region where the energy from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) peaks. We propose to use Voyager and IUE to obtain spectrally continuous observations of ten Seyfert I galaxies and quasars. Simultaneous IUE and Voyager measurements are crucial for properly subtracting the background light from the far ultraviolet (FU) spectra to detect these faint sources. Voyager will extend our continuum observations from 1260 down to 912 A, a significant percentage of the remaining spectrum. This previously unobserved FUV continuum is critical to our understanding of the energetics of the broad line region it ionizes. The FV in also the beat wavelength region In which to test the diverging predictions of different accretion disk models.  From previous IUE measurements, we have selected the ten Seyferts and quasars likely to be brightest below 1200 A and most easily detected by Voyager. The redshifts of six of these Seyferts will shift their Lyman edges redward of the Galaxy's H I absorption, and permit observation of their continua beyond the Lyman limit.  There are just three previous FUV detections of AGN*. The Voyager spacecraft has only until its Neptune encounter in mid-1989 to increase this sample size. In the remaining year that joint Voyager/IUE observations are possible, obtaining a larger sample of spectra is essential to deciding between disk models and better understanding energy generation In AGNs.|Y
QSKRE|Ultraviolet Spectra of the CfA Seyfert 1s|Richard A.|Edelson|Colorado - CASA|We propose to obtain SWP and LWP spectra of six bright Seyfert 1 galaxies (0048+29, Mkn 1243, NGC 4235, NGC 5273, 1614+35 and 2237+07), to complete the ultraviolet coverage for the CfA Seyfert 1 galaxies. This complete, unbiased, spectroscopically selected sample has been observed extensively at radio, infrared, optical and X-ray wavelengths, allowing the spectral energy distributions to be studied over nine decades of frequency. The optical-ultraviolet-X-ray continua will be fitted with new, realistic accretion disk models to yield source parameters such as the accretion rate, black hole mass and inclination. The statistics and correlations of these and other parameters, such as continuum and emission line luminosities, will be obtained for this complete sample.|Y
QSLBW|Polarized IRAS QSOs-'Normal' QSOs seen Edge-on?|Beverly|Wills|University of Texas at Austin|It is the strength of the mid-infrared spectrum that really singles out IRAS 1334+2438 from other AGN, but it is also the most luminous QSO to show the rare phenomenon of high, nonvariable, wavelength dependent polarization, and quite large line and continuum reddening (Wills et al. 1988). Based on optical and IR measurements, we have proposed a model for this object. consisting of a disk partially obscuring the nucleus, with electrons or small dust grains in the polar directions that scatter and polarize a relatively unreddened nuclear spectrum toward the observer. We have since discovered 2 more bright IRAS QSOs with similar high, wavelengthdependent polarization. We suggest a similar model for these. This model which is like other, proposed for IR-luminous, polarized Seyfert I nuclei, suggests that the observed properties of these polarized IRAS QSOs are likely to depend on viewing angle and so these objects may provide an important observational link between apparently different classes of AGN. They may also provide a link between the most luminous IRAS galaxies that could harbor almost completely dust-enshrouded QSOs, and the most luminous, least dusty QSOs. The proposed II observations of these 3 bright IRAS QSOs will provide a test of our model, and the suggested evolutionary and/or inclination-dependent links with other kinds of AGN and QSOs, through observations of line and continuum reddening due to dust (including the 2200 A feature), blueing due to Rayleigh-type scattering, a search for broad absorption lines, and an investigation of the low-ionization blended FeII emission.|Y
QSLDT|UV Observations of Two Bright Moderate Redshift Broad Absorption Line QSOs|David A.|Turnshek|Pittsburgh|Four low radiation shifts (US1) are requested so that two bright moderate redshift Broad Absorption Line (BAL) QSOs can be observed in the LWP and SWP cameras. Four different questions concerning BAL QSOs will be addressed by our program: (1) Is there any evidence, as has been reported in the past, that BAL region metal abundances are enhanced by factors of 10 - 100 over solar values? (2) Is there any evidence, as has been suggested based on IUE observations of the BAL QSO PGO946+301, that He I 584 broad emission is enhanced in BAL QSOs? (3) Is there any evidence for absorption from the weakly metastable transitions of CIII 1175, NIV 923, or OV 760 BALs in Q0059-2735? This would be indicative of high particle densities in the BAL region. (4) Finally, how do the emission line and BAL profiles compare kinematically in each of the two bright BAL QSOs? Combining our ground-based optical observations with the IUE spectra will allow us to compare from MgII down to the far UV.  Our previous work with IUE has included constraining the size scale and density of the BAL region gas (Turnshek et al. 1985, Ap.J. (Letters), 294, L1), determining the fraction of QSOs with BALs at low redshift (Turnshek and Grillmair 1986, Ap.J.(Letters), 31, L1), finding evidence for enhanced metal abundances in BAL regions (Turnshek et al. 1987, QSO Absorption Lines: Probing the Universe, Poster Papers, STScl Publication, p. 8), and comparing the emission line and BAL profiles in low redshift BAL QSOs from H-alpha down to Ly-alpha/NV (Turnshek et al. 1988, in preparation).|Y
QSLHM|A Search for rapid Variations in the UV Flux of PKS 2155-304 with IUE|H. Richard|Miller|Georgia State University|Ultraviolet observations of the BL Lac object PKS 2155-304 are proposed in an effort to determine the nature and the timescale of the variations in this region of the spectrum. Variations on much shorter timescales have previously been detected at both x-ray and optical wavelengths. This program will allow one to determine if variations on timescales comparable to that observed at optical and X-ray wavelengths are present or is the character of the variations different in the ultraviolet region of the spectrum.|Y
QSLMD|Ultraviolet Observations of a Bright Southern Quasar|Marc|Davis|UC Berkeley|Last year we discovered an optically bright quasar (V = 13.5) at low galactic latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere with a redshift of z = 0.0571. As one of the brightest quasars in the sky, and the most luminous quasar known with redshift less than 0.1, it is accessible to detailed study by IUE, and thus we propose to obtain low-resolution spectra with both the Long Wavelength and Short Wavelength Prime Cameras. Observations at ultraviolet wavelengths will give us the spectral energy distribution of the quasar over six decades of frequency, when we combine these observations with available optical, infrared, and radio observations. With these data, we hope to understand the emission mechanisms of the object. We will also study the emission lines in the ultraviolet; this is one of the few objects for which we can measure the hydrogen Ly-alpha to H-alpha ratio directly.|Y
QSLRR|The High Energy Spectrum of the QSO PKS 0558-504|Ronald A.|Remillard|MIT|We are on the threshold of defining the spectral properties of a prototype QSO. The results will have a direct impact on the efforts to build physical models for active galactic nuclei. The 15th mag QSO, PKS 0558-504 (= 1H 0553-507) has been observed at X-ray, UV, optical, and radio frequencies during the period of 1984 through 1987. EXOSAT observations (0.2 to 7.0 keV) reveal an unusually steep X-ray spectrum, which is fit by a single power law with an energy index (cc) of 1.31 (-0.08, +0.15 to 90% confidence). However, observations with IUE show a rather flat UV spectrum with a UV energy index ~ 0.5. The composite, multifrequency spectrum appears to exhibit a large UV-X-ray excess, which is similar to that of AGN like PG 1211+143. However, in the case of PKS 0558504, the excess appears to extend to X-ray energies > 5 keV. The crucial remaining questions are: (1) whether the X-ray spectrum flattens to a more typical value (alpha ~ 0.7) at X-ray energies above 5 keV, and (2) whether source variability is a significant factor in the assessment of the emission properties of the QSO. We have been awarded observing time with GINGA to measure the X-ray spectrum of PKS 0558-504 in the range of 2-20 keV during the latter half of 1989. This proposal is for near-simultaneous observations with IUE; additional optical and radio observations are also planned. A detailed multifrequency spectrum will be obtained, and we will be able to judge whether the X-ray spectrum is intrinsically steep or whether there is an extraordinary UV/X-ray "bump", as currently hypothesized. If the latter interpretation holds true, the physical model for the "bump" will be severely tested, since current theoretical considerations impose an upper limit of about 3 keV for the emission from a massive accretion disk.|Y
QSMJH|IUE and ROSAT Monitoring of the Bright QSO H1821+643|Jules P.|Halpern|Columbia|H1821+643 is distinguished from all other quasars by the fact that it is both a very strong UV and X-ray source, and is 3' from the ecliptic pole, which puts it in the field of view of the ROSAT PSPC for the exceptionally long period of 40 days during the all sky survey. At V = 14.2 and z = 0.297, H1821+643 is the second brightest object in the sky at z > 0.1. The optical/UV spectrum shows a strong "big bump" which, because of the redshift, is detected past the Lyman limit. IUE observations in 1989 showed a significant change in the spectral shape of the UV continuum. H1821+643 also has a variable, soft X-ray excess of the type which has been interpreted as the high-energy tail of the EUV emission from an accretion disk.  It has yet to be proven that the UV bump and the soft X-ray excess have a common origin, in this or in any AGN. The strong UV bump and soft X-ray excess, the emission in the far UV (lambda em < 912 A), the variability of both the UV and soft X-rays, and the moderate redshift, make H1821+643 an ideal QSO with which to study this question. By determining the time scale of the variability and the correlation between the UV and soft X-ray emission, we might be able to establish that both components arise in the inner disk, where the dynamical time is expected to be ~ 10 days. We propose to obtain IUE spectra every 5 days during the 40 day ROSAT visibility window in order to fully sample the previously observed minimum X-ray doubling time of 10 days.|Y
QSMRG|Lyman Continua and Absorption Systems in Bright High Redshift Quasars|Richard F.|Green|KPNO|Observation of high redshift quasars bright enough for IUE is of primary importance for at least two basic reasons: 1) to identify unabsorbed quasars whose continua can be studied below the Lyman limit, allowing better constraints on models of this emission, and 2) to identify line-of-sight Lyman-alpha absorption systems and study their properties, both with the discovery spectra and ground-based followup. Lines of sight to quasars are a probe of a regime of the intergalactic medium not readily sampled by imaging surveys.  We propose to observe 5 new bright (m < 16.5) high redshift (z > 2) quasars from recent Byurakan surveys with these goals in mind. By clarifying some problems with the standard accretion disk model, the new spectra should contribute to improved estimates of black hole mass and accretion rate in quasars. By enlarging the sample of quasars with long wavelength baseline spectra, the new data will also improve our estimates of the importance of intergalacatic reddening, which may significantly decrease the apparent number density of high redshift quasars.|Y
QSNAP|Simultaneous EUVE and IUE Observations of Quasars in Directions of Low Neutral Hydrogen|Alain|Porter|KPNO - NOAO|EUVE is expected to detect at least a few bright nearby quasars and active galactic nuclei in directions of low H I column density. These will complement and extend ROSAT observations of the peak and blue side of the big blue bump in AGN. We propose simultaneous observation of some of the best EUVE candidates with IUE to provide more complete spectrophotometry of the peak and high energy tail of the bump, allowing much better constraints on the parameters of models of the emission. Specifically, EUVE coverage may help remove the degeneracy between accretion rate and disk inclination in fits of thin accretion disk models. In any case, it will determine the highest temperature gas involved in thermal reprocessing of gravitationally released energy.|Y

QSPBW|The Ultra-Violet and Soft X-ray Properties of the PG Quasars|Belinda J.|Wilkes|Harvard CFA - SAO|The distinctive big blue bump feature in the continua of quasars dominates their optical and ultraviolet (UV) emission, peaks in the extreme-ultraviolet and extends into the soft X-ray as the ultra-soft excess component. Although multi-wavelength data have become available for a large number of quasars over the past few years, the available samples are heterogeneous so that no good estimate of the real distribution of blue bump strength in the quasar population can be made. This can be most efficiently remedied using the PG sample which is relatively bright, and so accessible to IUE, and has already been observed at many wavelengths. We have been awarded ROSAT and ground-based optical and infrared time to obtain contemporaneous energy distributions of a complete subset of low-redshift (z<0.4) PG quasars. We request IUE time to observe 8 quasars in our sample which have never been observed with IUE and 6 with insufficient IUE data. With this complete and well-defined sample we will be able to determine the distributions and true range of continuum properties for the low-redshift quasar population and thus to constrain models for the origin of the continuum emission in quasars.|Y

RADCD|The Nature of the Runaway O Stars|C. A.|Dean|S & M Systems|Currently, three models have been proposed to account for the runaway OB stars. We have devised a method by which we hope to differentiate among these models. We propose to observe 7 stars at high dispersion which when combined with existing IUE data will comprise a sample of 12 high galactic latitude (z > 200 pc) runaway O stars. In such a sample, O star runaways produced by Blaauw's mechanism would be more highly evolved. As a class, these objects would have observably higher mass loss rates than the normal sample of O stars. O subdwarfs and Old Disc Population objects in Carrasco's model, on the other hand, would be recognized by systematically lower mass loss rates, their anomalous ultraviolet CNO and possibly He line strengths when they are compared to a spectral grid constructed from now available IUE data. Even though it may not be possible to distinguish between Carrasco's objects and normal O subdwarfs, it is extremely important to determine what fraction of the runaway stars are true Extreme Population I objects.|Y
RAMAM|IUE Observations of the R Aquarii Jet and Counterjet|Andrew G.|Michalitsianos|NASA/GSFC|R Aquarii is a symbiotic variable containing a 387-day period Mira and a hot a hot accreting compact star. Although this system has been studied quite extensively at X-ray, UV, optical and radio wavelengths, many important questions concerning the origin of its nebular emission remain obscure. The presence of a bright optical/radio jet suggests that material is expelled in the form of a series of discrete emission knots, that define a broad, one sided arc, that is nearly ~7" (~2.5xlO^15cm) in NE extent. The presence of N V 1238,1240 and He II 1640 emission in the knots indicate this region is substantially hotter compared with the central HII region, where these lines are weak or absent. Application of accretion disk models to this system, that purport mass expulsion in the form of bipolar flow that is directed along the accretion disk poles, has been frustrated by the apparent one sidedness of this structure. However, recently obtained [O III] 5007 images, and deep 6-cm radio continuum maps obtained with the Very Large Array (VLA), indicate the presence of counterjet structure, which extends ~4 10^16cm (~1375 AU) SW from the central object. We propose to obtain IUE LORES SWP and LWP spectra of the SW structure, in order to determine if this newly found region exhibits similar excitation properties as the knots NE of the central object. The detection of N V and He II emission formed in a region of similar electron densities as that estimated for the structure to the NE (ne >= 10^4cm^-3), would lend further support for the bipolar nature of mass expulsion from this system. Moreover, continued monitoring of the central HII region and jet structure is needed because the NE knots appear to be increasing in UV line emission, since the discovery of soft X-rays from this system in 1985 observed with EXOSAT. We plan to coordinate IUE observations of R Aquarii with ROSAT observations which will be obtained with the High Resolution Imager (HRI). Our observing program, data analysis method follow.|Y
RANMK|Coordinated IUE and Speckle Observations of R Aqr Central Region|Margarita|Karovska|Harvard CFA - SAO|The R Aqr binary is one of the most peculiar objects in the class of symbiotic Systems because of its extremely complex and evolving circumbinary environment. R Aqr is the nearest symbiotic system and presents a unique opportunity to explore in detail the central H II region surrounding the Mira and the enigmatic presently unseen companion. Our aim in this proposal is to study in detail the continuum emission from this region and to determine the nature of the accreting companion which is crucial for better understanding of the ongoing activity in this complex system.  We propose to obtain IUE observations of the central H II region coordinated with groundbased photometry and high angular resolution speckle interferometry observations of the 2" field centered at the Mira variable position. Our primary goals are: (1) To determine accurately the continuum energy distribution of the hot component in the system; (2) To search for variations of the continuum on the time-scale of few hours to few months; (3) To resolve the companion.  The 1991/92 epoch is extremely favorable for observations of this system because the predicted orbital position of the companion corresponds to the largest apparent angular separation from the Mira star. In support of these observations, intensive ground-based polarimetric, spectroscopic. infrared, and radio observations of the R Aqr system will be conducted.|Y

Observations will be made with the SWP camera in low dispersion outside and during primary conjunction. If the chromospheric lines in the SWP region arise from the same plasma as H-alpha we should see decreased emission at conjunction. The behavior of the hotter lines (N V, Si IV, C IV) should allow us to constrain somewhat the location of the occulting material. The IUE observations will be accompanied by ground based spectroscopic and photometric observations to better define the state of the surface activity at that time.|Y

RCBAH|Ultraviolet Spectrophotometry of R Coronae Borealis Variables and Stars with Carbon-Rich Atmospheres|Albert V.|Holm|CSC|We propose to study the brightest R CrB variables for evidence relevant to the physical cause of the variability, to the sources of interstellar dust, and to the evolutionary role of these stars. The bright R CrB-type variables R CrB and RY Sgr will be observed on several occasions to obtain paired continuum measurements at light maximum and when partially obscured. We also propose to observe the UV emission line spectrum of R CrB and of comparison stars including normal F supergiants, carbon sequence Wolf-Rayet stars, and possibly a cool carbon star. The purpose of this observing program is:  1) to use the continuum measurements of R CrB and RY Sgr to verify whether their variability is due to extinction by graphite grains and, if so, to determine the physical parameters of the grains, and  2) to use the line spectrum of the R CrB variables, the normal Ftype supergiants, and the carbon-rich stars to compare abundance abnormalities for evidence regarding evolutionary relationships.|Y
RCCAH|Ultraviolet Spectrophotometry of R Coronae Borealis Variables|Albert V.|Holm|CSC|We propose to continue the study of the brightest R CrB variables for evidence relevant to the physical cause of the variability, to the evolutionary state of these stars, and to their role as sources of interstellar dust. The observational goal of this program is to obtain continuum measurements of each star when at light maximum and when partially obscured. The wavelength dependence of the variation will be used to determine whether the variability is due to extinction by graphite grains. To date this program has obtained baseline measurements of R CrB and observations of RY Sgr during its recovery from the 1977/78 minimum. The RY Sgr observations, thus far, suggest obscuration by a combination of a diffuse component of large (0.03 to 0.04 micron) grains and by dense, opaque clouds.  At minimum light the exposure times required are unfeasibly long. Therefore, the stars must be observed shortly after the decline begins. The residence of two of the proposers at Goddard Space Flight Center makes possible the rapid response necessary to obtain the observations when notified by the AAVSO.|Y
RCDJH|Dust Extinction in R CRB Type Stars|J.|Hecht|NASA/GSFC|On the appearance of a drop in the visual magnitude of an R CrB star (R CrB or RY Sgr) UV measurements from 3000-1800 A will be made. From these measurements and a measurement made before the decrease, extinction curves will be calculated. The 2200 A 'graphite' feature will be searched for. Its exact position, shape and time evolution will allow a determination of the source of the feature, the dust particle size, distribution, and the particle growth rate. The initial interpretation will use extinction calculations of graphite already performed. Later interpretation will use the results of carbon condensation experiments which will soon be performed.|Y
RCEAH|Extinction in R CRB Variables|Albert V.|Holm|CSC|After a drop in the visual magnitude of an R CrB star (R CrB, RY Sgr, XX Cam, or MV Sgr), a sequence of ultraviolet measurements in the 1800 R3200 R range will be made. From these spectra and from reference spectra we have obtained at maximum light, extinction curves will be calculated. A detailed study of the shape of the extinction and its time variation will allow a determination of the source of the feature, the particle size distribution, and the particle growth rate. Interpretation will use calculations of graphite extinction and the results of carbon condensation experiments in progress.  In the past this program has monitored a portion of the recovery of RY Sgr from its 1977/78 minimum. An important goal of the program is to monitor a complete fading cycle, especially the earliest part of the decline, and to measure the wavelength dependence of the circumstellar extinction for other variables. The variation of the derived grain parameters with time from the initial drop in visual light and from star to star will be used to draw conclusions on the mechanism which causes the grain formation.  The exposure times are expected to be unfeasibly long after the stars fall below visual magnitude 10. Residing at Goddard Space Flight Center, the proposers are able to provide the rapid response necessary for the critical early observations.|Y
RCFAH|Extinction in R CRB Variables|Albert V.|Holm|CSC|Through our earlier observing programs, we have shown that the veiling of RY Sgr, the second brightest R CrB-type variable, is consistent with extinction by circumstellar clouds of carbon grains. The wavelength dependence of our extinction curves, which were obtained during RY Sgr's recovery from the 1977/78 minimum. were best fit by amorphous carbon grains of 0.02 micron radius or by graphite grains of 0.043 micron radius. Such grains are considerably larger than predicted by some models of grain formation. The wavelength dependence of the internal extinction in the planetary nebula Abell 30 appears to be very similar to that for RY Sgr. This similarity suggests that a common dust producing mechanism is at work. Questions still exist regarding how the dust forms and how the grain size evolves during an episode.  We propose to obtain a sequence of ultraviolet measurements in the 1800 A3200 A range throughout a minimum of R CrB, RY Sgr, XX Cam, or KV Sgr. A detailed study of the extinction and its time variation will allow a determination of the source of the feature, the particle size distribution, and the particle growth rate. The variation of the derived grain parameters with time will be used to draw conclusions on the mechanism which causes the grain formation.  Residing at Goddard Space Flight Center, the proposers are able to provide the rapid response necessary for the critical early observations.  Three observations of RY Sgr will be obtained during its recovery from its early 1982 minimum to determine whether the behavior of the extinction curve during recovery repeats.|Y
RCIAH|Emission Line Spectrum of R CRB Variablies|Albert V.|Holm|CSC|We will study the emission line spectrum of R CrB during its current minimum to improve our understanding of the obscuring cloud of grains which forms in the vicinity of this relatively hot star and to better understand the structure of its helium-carbon atmosphere. Our past studies of the extinction of R CrB and RY Sgr during a recovery from minimum have shown that important spectral-regions are strongly contaminated by emission arising in an extended cloud of ionized metals. At IUE's resolution, most of these lines cannot be observed directly when the star is bright. To measure the emission, we will obtain low dispersion spectra when R CrB is fainter than 10th magnitude visually. To obtain an estimate of its rate of change, we will obtain a second observation at least four weeks later. The observed emission line spectra then will be subtracted from previously obtained continuum observations to make a more accurate determination of the shape of the extinction, especially shortward of 2400A. These accurate extinction determinations are required for modeling of the source of the extinction. In addition, we will use the emission lines to obtain an understanding of the conditions in the extended stellar atmosphere of this F-type supergiant.  This program represents an extension of our previous studies of R CrB and RY Sgr, highly evolved stars that are returning material into the interstellar medium.|Y
RCIJD|UV Spectroscopy of V348 SGR|John S.|Drilling|Louisiana State|Observing time is requested to obtain a low-resolution spectrum of V348 Sgr at maximum light which is well exposed in the region 2200 2500 A. This spectrum will be used along with hydrogen-poor model atmospheres and an optical study of the interstellar reddening in the vicinity of V348 Sgr to determine both the effective temperature of this star and the nature of the circumstellar material surrounding it.|Y
RCKAH|Helium Pulsational Variables|Albert V.|Holm|CSC ST|The hydrogen-deficient carbon stars R CrB and RY Sgr show a semi-regular variability that is apparently the helium star analogue of the Cepheid phenomenon. In both stars the amplitude is small and variable. Occasionally these stars also show major declines in light due to the formation of circumstellar dust. We have studied one episode of a rare intermediate amplitude dip in brightness of R CrB in detail and find that both photospheric temperature changes and variable obscuration by dust were involved. We propose to observe this star and RY Sgr to learn how the process of dust formation is related to the amplitude and timescale of the photospheric variations of the star. In particular, we expect to compare with our earlier results the range in temperature variation, the amplitude of dust attenuation, and the phase difference between the extremes of temperature and attenuation.|Y
RCMBW|Comprehensive Coverage of an R CRB Dust Ejection Cycle|Barbara A.|Whitney|Harvard SAO - CFA|It is over 50 years since it was first suggested that the deep light minima observed in the R CrB stars are caused by dust condensing out of gas ejected from the star along the line of sight. Today, this process is still very mysterious. Extensive IUE observations have been made of several R CrB stars. However, only fragmentary data exist for any one cycle of any R CrB star. In addition, simultaneous ultraviolet and visible observations have never been attempted. As a result, there are many unanswered questions about these stars: How is material ejected from these stars? Is it related to pulsations? Where does the dust form? What is the source of the chromospheric emission seen during declines? And what is the evolutionary status of these stars? Therefore, it is proposed to obtain much better coverage of an R CrB fading by beginning IUE and simultaneous ground-based spectrophotometric and polarimetric observations of the star at the onset of the decline, and following the star through a complete cycle.  These data will supply many of the missing pieces to the R CrB puzzle thereby permitting the interaction of the various processes involved to be analyzed. Low dispersion IUE and visible spectrophotometry will enable the construction of extinction curves and provide spectral information from 2000 to 9000 A. This will give information on the formation and evolution of the dust grains as well as the general evolution of the chromospheric spectrum associated with the decline. High dispersion IUE spectra will allow the chromospheric emission and gas motions in the early and late stages of the decline to be analyzed in detail. The spectropolarimetry will provide information on both the nature of the dust grains and the location of the dust around the star.|Y
RCMJD|UV Spectroscopy of MV SGR|John S.|Drilling|Louisiana State|Observing time is requested to obtain low resolution spectra of the hot R CrB star MV Sgr during one of its minima. These spectra will be used along with existing IUE spectra, an optical study of stars near MV Sgr in the sky, and hydrogen-poor model atmospheres to determine the nature of newly-formed circumstellar material around this star and to determine the effective temperature of the star.|Y

RCQGC|The Decline and Fall of R Coronae Borealis|Geoffrey|Clayton|Colorado - CASA|Observations of R Coronae Borealis stars in decline are rare. This is due in part to the unpredictability of these stars which undergo declines at irregular intervals of 1 to 10 years. In the last several years, we have been able to improve the situation by making good use of the flexible scheduling of IUE using Target of Opportunity time to observe these stars in the early stages of decline, and get good coverage of their spectral evolution. We have obtained IUE observations during deep declines of V854 Cen and RY Sgr. These new data have allowed us to compare and contrast the spectral evolution in the UV with that in the visible, and to infer that the dust must be forming very near the photosphere in the RCB stars. In addition, V854 Cen was found to show strong C II] lambda 2325 and C I lambda 2965 emission not seen in other RCB stars, and to show large emission profile variations which may be spectral evidence of the dust-forming material around these stars. We would like to take this last opportunity of observing with IUE to fill in a gaping hole in our database. This hole is the absence of good UV spectral data on the prototype of the RCB class, R CrB in a decline. This star has the largest database of visible observations but little in the UV. Therefore we request Target of Opportunity time to observe R CrB if it goes into decline.|Y

RFNRR|A Search for Energetic Transient Activity in Cool, Giant Stars|Richard D.|Robinson|CSC - GHRS|A recent 8.4 GHz radio survey of 82 nearby cool giant stars detected radio emission from 24 of the objects. In all cases the radio emissions detected were variable and non-thermal in origin. suggesting a flare-like process. An optical follow-up to this survey showed that the radio emitters were apparently normal field giants, with standard metal abundance, macroturbulence and rotational velocities. The only significant anomaly was a larger than average value of Lithium abundance for the radio sources, suggesting youth. The existence of radio bursts from such stars is unexpected and the physical processes causing the bursts are probably different from those operating on the active RS CVn and FE Comae giants. Here we propose a detailed examination Of One of the most active of the field giants to search for UV signatures related to radio flares.|Y
RGERO|Nonthermal Ultraviolet Radiation in Nearby Compact Radio Sources|Robert W.|O'Connell|Virginia|Study of nearby active nuclei can yield important information on the interaction between the nucleus and its environment, information which cannot be obtained on bright QSO's and BL Lac systems at large distances. Unusually powerful 10mu radiation has recently been detected from the nuclei of nearby E/SO galaxies with compact radio sources. In one case, optical data also suggests the presence of optical nonthermal radiation. We propose UV observations of three galaxies in order to search for strong nonthermal components and specifically to test the proposition that the 10mu excesses are produced by thermal re-radiation from dust grains heated by the UV components.|Y
RGERP|FE II UV Multiplet Observations of Broad Line Radio Galaxies|Richard C.|Puetter|Cal San Diego|Broad line. radio galaxies represent an extreme subclass of broad line emitting extragalactic objects. In the broad line radio galaxies optical Fe II emission is small if not absent. Detection of UV Fe II emission will thus imply small optical depth in the Fe II lines. Non-detection of UV Fe II will indicate either the absence of Fe or a very different Fe ionization structure. Either result would be extremely interesting and add additional insight into the broad line phenomenon in general.|Y
RGFRR|Further Observations of Hydrogen Lines and FeII Emission in Broad-Line Radio Galaxies|Richard|Rudy|University of Arizona|This proposal is a continuation of two previous programs, "UV/ Optical/Infrared Observations of Broad-Line Radio Galaxies" and "Fe II UV Multiplet Observations of Broad-Line Radio Galaxies" which we believe to be warranted by the data already obtained. The extensive wavelength coverage of the hydrogen lines (i.e. Ly-alpha, the Balmer Series, and P-alpha) provides leverage in sorting out both the reddening and radiative transfer effects which largely determine the line ratios in these objects. Measurement of the UV/optical FeII emission provides additional information about the optical depths in the broad-line region as well as information about the iron ionization structure, abundance and possible depletion due to dust grain formation. We are no longer carrying on a general UV survey of the class but are observing objects for which observations at optical and IR wavelengths indicate a need for UV measurements (see Table 1 for the existing data).|Y
RGGGF|Ultraviolet and Optical Observations of Narrow Line Radio Galaxies|Gary J.|Ferland|Kentucky|We propose to obtain nearly simultaneous optical and ultraviolet spectrophotometry of several narrow line radio galaxies. These objects are a subclass of the group of active galactic nuclei which are characterized by a featureless continuum and narrow emission lines, but which have very weak or no broad lines or Fe II emission. As a result, it will be possible to make reliable measurements of intensities of the narrow emission lines with low resolution IUE data. The weak Fe II emission will facilitate measurement of the shape of the optical to ultraviolet-continuum without contamination from the many ultraviolet lines which cover this region. By combining optical, ultraviolet, and x-ray observations of the featureless continuum with a composite optical and ultraviolet--emission line spectrum, we will have the type of information needed for comparison with photoionization calculations. Such calculations will be performed and are intended to determine some characteristics of the emitting gas and to check whether photoionization by the featureless continuum can fully account for the emission line spectrum. Finally, direct examination of the far ultraviolet continuum will allow us to examine the speculation that narrow line radio galaxies may have an inner broad line region which has been obscured by dust along the line of sight to the central engine.|Y
RGIDC|Observations of Broad-Line Radio Galaxies|D. Michael|Crenshaw|CSC|We propose to obtain simultaneous ultraviolet and optical observations of five broad-line radio galaxies. Since the resolution of the SWP camera in low dispersion is only ~1500 km s^-1 at the position of L-alpha, the narrow and broad components of Ly-alpha in Seyfert 1 galaxy spectra are blended such that it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to separate the two components. It is possible to deconvolve the narrow and broad components in certain broad-line radio galaxies, however, because the broad-line profiles are wider and more flattopped than those in Seyfert 1 spectra. The only clear identification of a composite broad/narrow Ly-alpha profile has been for the broad-line radio galaxy 3C 390.3. Thus we plan to use methods developed for studies of optical profiles to deconvolve the two components of the Ly-alpha profile for five broadline radio galaxies.  Previous IUE observations of our candidates were made 2 to 10 years after the optical observations, and only two of the candidates have spectra that are well exposed. Since most Seyfert 1 galaxies and broad-line radio galaxies have broad emission lines that are strongly variable on timescales of months or years, simultaneous ultraviolet and optical observations are needed to determine L-alpha, H-beta, and H-alpha fluxes for both the narrow and broad components. The line ratios will be used to investigate the physical conditions and reddening in the narrow- and broad-line regions. We will compare our results for broadline radio galaxies with those obtained for Seyfert 1 galaxies and narrow-line radio galaxies.|Y
RGLJS|NGC 4410: A Nearby, Bright "Cooling Flow"|John|Stocke|University of Colorado|NGC 4410 is a nearby, bright (Z=0.025; V=14) radio galaxy with very bright, spatially extended, low-ionization emission lines. The ionization state of the emission region is very low, similar to that in LINERS (ionization parameter log r~-3.5) but, because the emission is extremely extended (10 Kpc), this emission most resembles the filamentary emission seen in "cooling flows." The presence of a substantial x-ray source confirms the "cooling flow" identification. Although not extremely luminous, because it is so nearby, NGC 4410 is one of the brightest cooling flows known. And because it is one of the few bright ones whose optical emission is unobscured by an active nucleus (unlike Perseus A), it can be well-studied in the UV with the IUE. The ionization source in this type of emission is not yet understood. With the potential presence of both high and low ionization lines, UV spectroscopy with the IUE will be extremely helpful in identifying the ionization source for "cooling flows".  Another class of objects whose emission lines are similar to cooling flows" in ionization state and extent are the high redshift radio galaxies (Z > 1)! IUE observations are the crucial link between nearby "cooling flows" like NGC 4410 and the high redshift radio galaxies. The Z > 1 radio galaxy spectra show lines only visible in the ultraviolet at zero redshift. Therefore, the only way to determine unambiguously that the distant 3CR radio galaxies are cooling flows is to obtain ultraviolet spectra of nearby cooling flows like NGC 4410 to compare with the optical spectra obtained by Spinrad.|Y
RGLWK|Comparison of Nearby and Very-High-Redshift Radio Galaxies|William C.|Keel|Alabama|We propose to obtain both SWP and LWR spectra for four nearby elliptical radio galaxies (V<14.5) whose emission-line spectra are apparently similar to those recently found in very high-redshift (z >> 1) giant elliptical (and other) radio galaxies from deep radio surveys. These distant objects cannot be understood without reference to nearby counterparts for which the optical-line diagnostics are well developed.  In Windhorst's very deep radio survey, faint high-surface-brightness galaxies were recently found at redshifts up to 2.5, showing relatively weak- emission lines. All the available measurements are consistent with these objects being giant elliptical galaxies as seen 1-2 Gyr after starting collapse from the Hubble expansion. Most of these highredshift objects have emission lines suggesting that they are analogous to LINERs. They may be the dynamically more-evolved remnants of the objects seen at higher radio power and larger redshift. Since the current radio surveys are deep enough to find such giant radio-loud ellipticals to redshifts well beyond 10, and all the radio sources have now been identified to a limit V=27. such deep radio samples should contain all such "normal" ellipticals in a given survey area.  We hypothesize that all giant elliptical galaxies at z > 1 were associated with at least weak nuclear activity. perhaps as a by-product of processes related to their formation which have died out in most low-redshift ellipticals.  Hence, a study of the nature and evolution of high-redshift elliptical galaxies requires comparison of their optical spectra (in the emitted UV) with UV spectra of nearby objects having strong emission lines of similar ionization, which appear to be LINERs among powerful radio galaxies. We have prepared a sample of such objects. and propose here to obtain the requisite low-dispersion spectra for those not already observed with IUE.|Y
RGMCU|ROSAT-Coordinated IUE Observations of Superluminal Radio Sources|C. Megan|Urry|STScI|Superluminal radio sources are more likely to be relativistic jets than any other extragalactic object. Multifrequency spectra, obtained with coordinated IUE~ROSAT observations and ground-based radio (total flux), sub-millimeter, infrared, and optical observations, combined with VLBI mapping, can strongly constrain relativistic jet models. The components in a superluminal source can be resolved with VLBI, yielding their sizes, their bulk Lorentz factors, and with multifrequency VLBI, their individual spectra. The X-ray spectrum reflects the origin of the emission and allows us to discriminate between synchrotron and self-Compton components. Therefore the X-ray flux provides either a direct measure of the self- Compton emission or an upper limit to it, and thus a lower limit to the kinematic Doppler factor, S. An independent determination of the bulk Lorentz factor comes from VLBI measurements of superluminal motion. Together these fully define the speed and orientation of the relativistic jet. This in turn has implications for grand unified models of AGN and the population statistics of quasars, blazars, and radio galaxies.|Y
RGMWK|Comparison of Nearby and Very-High-Redshift Radio Galaxies|Willuam C.|Keel|Alabama|We propose to obtain SWP spectra for several nearby elliptical radio galaxies (V<14.5) whose emission-line spectra are apparently similar to those recently found in very high-redshift (z >> 1) radio galaxies from deep radio surveys. These distant objects cannot be understood without reference to nearby counterparts for which the optical-line diagnostics are well developed. We have obtained or reprocessed IUE data for three such nearby objects, and now wish to extend the ionization range of radio galaxies with UV spectra so that comparisons with high-redshift objects will be more secure.  In Windhorst's very deep radio survey, faint high-surface-brightness galaxies were recently found at redshifts up to 2.3, showing relatively weak emission lines. Most of these high-redshift objects have emission lines whose ionization levels suggest that the are analogous to those of LINERs. These systems may be the dynamically more-evolved remnants of the objects seen at higher radio power and still larger redshift. Since the current radio surveys are deep enough to find such giant radio-loud ellipticals to redshifts well beyond 10, and all the radio sources have now been identified to a limit V=27, such deep radio samples should contain all such "normal" ellipticals in a given survey area.  The detection fractions of faint radio galaxies with strong emission lines suggest, as a working hypothesis, that all giant elliptical galaxies at z > 1 were associated with at least weak nuclear activity, perhaps as a remnant of processes related to their formation which have died out in most low-redshift ellipticals.  Hence, a study of the nature and evolution of high-redshift elliptical galaxies requires comparison of their optical spectra (in the emitted UV) with UV spectra of nearby objects having strong emission lines of similar ionization, which appear to be LINERs among powerful radio galaxies. We have prepared a sample of such objects, selected to be observable with IUE and to span the range of ionization properties observed in radio galaxies. We now have short-wavelength spectra of useful quality for three of these and are proposing here to augment this small sample with 2-3 additional objects, particularly those with high levels of ionization not represented in the existing data.|Y
RGNBT|IUE Observations of Extremely Metal-Deficient Red Giants|Bruce|Twarog|U Kansas|Observations of extremely metal-deficient red giants provide critical clues to the early nucleosynthetic history of the Galaxy. Photometric analysis has revealed that two stars in this key set, BD -18 5550 and CD -38 0245, are anomalous in that all photometric abundance estimates based on the region blueward of 4200 Amake -18 5550 more metal-poor and CD -38 0245 more metal-rich than their high resolution spectroscopic results. In short, -18 5550 shows an ultraviolet excess and CD -38 0245 a ultraviolet deficiency. Since these anomalies are not predicted by standard model atmospheres, they cast doubt on the validity of some of the spectroscopic elemental abundances. We propose low resolution observations in the near ultraviolet for these stars which will be compared with an array of archived spectra for other metal-poor giants. The comparison will be used to derive the wavelength dependence of the anomalies, and to place some constraints on their sources, including a possible blue companion for -18 5550.|Y
RGNLW|Polarization and Dust Nucleation in Mass-losing Red Giants|Lee Anne|Willson|Iowa State University|Mira variables typically show highly phase-dependent and wavelength dependent linear polarization of the order of 1-3%, usually explained as the result of scattering by dust or molecules deep in the atmosphere. But the Mira-like SR variables L2 Pup and V CVn show linear polarization up to 8%, much higher than can be accounted for by such scattering alone. Further, L2 Pup's light curve and polarization change on timescales of tens of cycles, as dust grains grow and are ejected. Electron scattering could play an important role in producing the phase-dependent polarization in these stars; the scattering electrons would be either in the ionized post-shock material that produces H Balmer and MgII emission, or in a shock-heated region (calorisphere) in the extended stellar atmosphere. With simultaneous monitoring of the polarization, the H Balmer and the MgII emission, using detailed model calculations to interpret the observations, we expect to be able to determine the origin and nature of the observed polarization. MgII is a powerful probe of the ionization structure and shock development in these stars; thus the proposed IUE observations are most critical to the success of this project.|Y
RGNTA|Coordinated Observations of Interacting Peculiar REG Giant Binaries|Thomas B.|Ake|CSC - GHRS|Coordinated IUE and H-alpha observations are to be made for the three known interacting binaries involving a carbon or S star as the primary component: HD 35155 (S3/2), HR 1105 (S3.5/2), and HD 59643 (C6,2). Earlier IUE observations have shown that all of these systems are highly variable in the UV and likely involve accretion of material from winds or gas streams from the primaries onto degenerate companions . We have argued that these objects are systems where the PRG primary has not been formed by internal dredge up on its own but rather was created by mass transfer from the current secondary component when it was an AGB star. Complete models of the systems are difficult to determine from the previous IUE data since they were taken sporatically. We do know that different emission and absorption lines and parts of the continua arise from different places in the systems, We have recently obtained H-alpha observations of HD 35155 and find it to show variable emission as well. We propose to use simultaneous UV and H-alpha observations to locate the line and continuum forming regions, model the accretion rates, and determine whether these objects are or have been mass transfer binaries.|Y
RGPLS|Star Formation and Accretion in Polar Ring Galaxies|Linda S.|Sparke|U Wisconsin|We propose to investigate the properties of the UV emission of a selected sample of polar ring (PR) galaxies. The feasibility of such a program has been shown by recent IUE observations (Arnaboldi et al. 1992) of the "narrow" polar ring galaxy AM 2020-504; the UV flux from this system is remarkably high, and the SED resembles that of a starburst galaxy rather than a standard elliptical. This evidence suggests that material from the gas-rich ring has been accreted relatively recently (within the past few hundred million years) onto the central elliptical galaxy. We propose to observe a further four polar ring galaxies, including representatives with "wide", "narrow", and complex rings. These data will be combined with those for AM 2020-504 to investigate the relationship between starburst characteristics and the ring morphology, and whether the different morphologies are likely to reflect different evolutionary histories.|Y
RGRAS|Probing the Brihgt Nuclei of Six Ring Galaxies|Alfred B.|Schultz|CSC - Astronomy Programs|We propose to observe the bright nuclei of six ring galaxies. The proposed targets are examples of a head-on collision between two galaxies, and are not polar ring galaxies or resonant ring galaxies. Theory suggests that during the initial head-on collision phase, starburst activity is triggered in the nucleus due to cloud-cloud collisions. The proposed IUE observations will be used to validate this prediction. The SWP camera in low dispersion mode will be used to verify the presence of early type stars and starburst activity, through the detection of UV lines of N V (1240 A), Si IV (1402 A), C IV (1550 A), and possibly He II (1640 A).  The six target ring galaxies were selected on the basis of their morphology, a nearby or embedded companion, and IRAS detections. Starburst activity, presumably triggered during the collision phase, has occurred, as evident by the IRAS detections. The target list is composed of pairs of targets representing similar characteristics and different phases during the collision process. IUE is an ideal tool to investigate collisionally induced starburst activity because early type stars, O and B stars, radiate most of their energy in the far UV spectral region detected by IUE. The IUE observations can provide crucial information about the stellar population as well as the ages of the burst through comparisons of observed characteristics with evolutionary models.|Y
RGRBT|IUE Observations of Extremely Metal-Deficient Red Giants|Bruce A.|Twarog|U Kansas|Observations of extremely metal-deficient red giants provide critical clues to the early nucleosynthetic history of the Galaxy. Photometric analysis revealed that two stars in this key set, BD -18 5550 and CD -38 0245, are anomalous in that all photometric abundance estimates based on the region blueward of 4200 A indicate that BD -18 5550 is more metal-poor and CD -38 0245 more metal-rich than results based upon high resolution spectroscopy. Though a subdwarf companion remained an option to explain the ultraviolet excess in BD -18 5550, no obvious alternative existed for CD -38 0245 except a broad-band ultraviolet absorption feature. IUE spectra obtained in Oct. 1991 eliminated the binary option and demonstrated that BD -18 5550 was exceptionally nitrogen-deficient while CD -38 0245 was exceptionally nitrogen-rich. CD -38 0245 also exhibited evidence for chromospheric line filling in the Mg II doublet, a potential link to the longterm Ca II variability in the star. We propose to reobserve these two stars to check for a change in the Mg II lines and to add a third extremely metal-deficient giant which exhibits photometric anomalies analogous to those found in CD -38 0245. Observations of CS 22885-96 will be used to confirm the nitrogen excess observed CD -38 0245 and to search for chromospheric emission in Mg II.|Y

RJNMK|UV Observations of the R Aquarii Jet Using HST and IUE|Minas C.|Kafatos|George Mason University|Although R Aquarii has been studied quite extensively at X-ray, UV, optical and radio wavelengths, many important questions concerning the origin of its nebular emission remain obscure. The presence of a bright optical/radio jet and a recently discovered counterjet suggests that material is expelled in the form of a series of discrete emission knots, that in the NE direction define a broad arc, that is nearly ~ 7" (~2.5 x 10^16 cm) in extent. The presence of N V 1238, 1240 and He II 1640 emission in the knots indicates this region is substantially hotter compared with the central HII region, where these lines are weak or absent. Recently obtained [O III] 5007 images, and deep 6-cm radio continuum maps obtained with the Very Large Array (VLA), indicate the presence of counterjet structure, which extends ~4 x 10^16 cm SW from the central object. We propose to obtain IUE LORES SWP and LWP spectra of the NE structure B and A as well as the central HII region in conjunction with HST observations in order to obtain multiplexing of the UV spectrum and monitor the UV properties of these structures. Continued monitoring of the central HII region and jet structure is needed because the NE knots appear to be increasing in UV line emission, since the discovery of soft X-rays from this system in 1985 observed with EXOSAT. Our observing program, data analysis method follow.|Y

RMIJL|Rotational Modulation of 44 Bootis|Jeffery L.|Linsky|Colorado|We propose to obtain a Lyman Alpha Emission light curve for the brightest late-type contact binary 44, Bootis (mv=6.1, G8V, P=6.43 h, d=12 pc). We request one US2 shift that is contiguous with one ESA/SERC shift from a related proposal to ESA/SERC. Two contiguous shifts, covering two consecutive orbits, guarantee that a sufficient number of spectra will be obtained to construct a reliable L-alpha-light curve indicative of the inhomogeneous distribution of Lo. across the surface. Also transient events (flares, etc.) can be separated with two contiguous shifts. The Lyman-alpha emission will be determined from short exposure (10 min) SWP low resolution images (about 10 exposures per shift) using special analysis techniques we have developed. These methods subtract the geocoronal contribution and correct the interstellar absorption (small in the line of sight towards 441 Boo; NH<10^18 cm^-2). All (except one) of the many existing archive spectra of 441Boo are saturated at L-alpha since they were obtained with long exposure times to bring up the weaker chromospheric-transition region lines. We plan to perform these observations simultaneously with our requested EXOSAT program (AOIV), during which time the X-ray light curves (3 orbits, low and medium energy X-rays) will be obtained. Our previous EXOSAT light curve of 441 Boo reveals many interesting features. These simultaneous observations allow us to study the possible correlation between the Lyman-alpha emission and the X-ray flux as a function of orbital phase. With this information we believe that we will be able to solve the important theoretical question: Is the L-alpha-emitting region (upper chromosphere) heated from below or from above (by coronal X-rays).|Y
RMORP|V342 AQL: An Active Algol System in the Rapid Mass Transfer Phase?|Ronald S.|Polidan|NASA/GSFC|V342 Aq1 is a strongly interacting short period (3.39 days) binary system that was the subject of an investigatory IUE study last year. These data show a B-type continuum severely cut by a strong, highly variable, circumstellar envelope. These IUE data, and new optical data argue that V342 Aql may be an Algol system in the long searched for rapid phase of mass transfer. We propose to obtain a series of low resolution SWP and LWP observations over the orbital cycle of V342 Aql at two different epochs, including total primary eclipse, in order to study the ultraviolet stellar continuum and the distribution and time variation of the circumstellar matter in this binary system. This program will obtain a clearer view of the photospheric spectrum of the mass gainer, locate where the circumstellar gas is in the binary system by using multiple lines of sight, and measure the amount and variability of the gas using column densities determined from a detailed radiative transfer model. We hope as a result to derive a better understanding of the rapid phase of mass transfer in close binary systems. This proposal is part of a multiwavelength coordinated effort (IUE spectrophotometry and optical/near-infrared spectroscopy and photometry) to study this intriguing system.|Y
RNEHJ|Studies of the Ultraviolet Spectra of Carbon Stars|Hollis|Johnson|Indiana University|The IUE satellite will be used to study the ultraviolet spectra of stars with carbon-rich compositions and with effective temperatures between 2500 and 5500 K. These R and N-type carbon stars encompass the luminosity range from giants to supergiants. Low-resolution observations in the long wavelength region of the IUE instruments are useful to study the photospheric continuum radiation from these stars. The absolute flux, as well as the slope of this continuum in the wavelength range 2200-3000 A should be a sensitive probe of the extent of non-radiative heating in the upper photosphere. Such heating, if present, will retard the formation of the CO molecule and, since CO provides the bulk of the cooling in radiative-equilibrium models of the upper photosphere, the emergent continuum flux should increase. High resolution observations in the long wavelength region will be used to study the Mg II k-line profile for evidence of circumstellar features as well as to determine the width of the emission core. This width is proportional to the stellar luminosity (by the Wilson-Bappu effect) and hence provides information on a fundamental stellar parameter which is poorly known for carbon stars: the luminosity. A few low resolution observations in the short wavelength region will be attempted in order to search for chromospheric emission features in carbon stars. The detection of such features would provide new and important information on the nature of chromospheric activity in these evolved objects. Finally, a few high-dispersion observations will be made with the long-wavelength camera to permit line identification.|Y
RNLAW|Large-Angle Scattering in Reflection Nebulae|Adolf N.|Witt|Toledo|We propose to obtain low-resolution IUE-spectra of two reflection nebulae, IC 59 and IC 63, which are detached from their illuminating star and are, therefore, very likely to scatter at large scattering angles. By comparing the nebular spectra with the spectrum of the common illuminating star, Gamma Cas, the wavelength dependence of the amplitude of the scattering phase function and the phase function asymmetry in the UV can be constrained. our ultimate goal is the determination of the size distribution of grains responsible for UV scattering, especially the small particle component.  A special bonus of the proposed program will be the opportunity to study the spectrum of the Be star Gamma Cas, the illuminating star of IC 59 and IC 63, from two additional directions via reflection. Since the two nebulae are separated by at least 50 degrees in their view of the Be star, the reflected spectra provide a unique chance to look for the predicted asymmetry in the radiation fields from the equator and pole.|Y
RPREG|Rotation Periods of the Old Solar-type Stars: Alpha Cen A, B. and Beta Hydri|Edward F.|Guinan|Villanova University|We propose an extended series of IUE LWPHI and SWPLO observations of 3 critically important and wellstudied solar-type stars: alpha Cen A (G2 V: tau = 5-6 Gyr), alpha Cen B (K1 V; tau = 5-6 Gyr), and beta Hyi (G2 IV; tau = 9.5 Gyr). These stars are among our nearest neighbors. Through extensive studies all their physical properties are well-determined, except for their rotation periods. From the estimated values of v sin i <2 km/sec and low activity levels, they are most likely slow rotators, with periods probably in the range of 10 60 days but at present highly uncertain. We are requesting a series of IUE observations over an interval of about 2 months (~ 2-3 x 1/2 US2 shifts per week) to determine their rotation periods and to map the distribution of magnetic structures on their surfaces. The best, and possiblv only hope of determining these periods is with IUE, through accurate measurement of the strongest emission features, such as Mg II h and k (2800 A), O I (1300 A), C II (1335 A), and C IV (1550 A). The periods of these stars are extremely important for constraining stellar evolutionary models that include rotation, and for theories of rotational evolution and redistribution of angular momentum in the interiors of solar-type stars. They are also significant for our study of the evolution of solar magnetic activity: alpha Cen A and beta Hyi are proxies for the old Sun. Also, as time permits, we will obtain LWPLO spectra of nearby alpha Cen C (Proxima Centauri) to determine its rotation period from its strong Mg  II h and k and Fe II (2605 A) emission features.|Y

RRBRB|Observations of RR Lyrae|Roger A.|Bell|Maryland|The aim of the research described in this proposal is to improve our knowledge of the ultra-violet line spectra of stars. This will be done by observing the brightest cluster type variable star, RR Lyrae. The observations will be compared with the predictions of model stellar atmospheres. The differences between the observations and the predictions will be examined with the aim of improving the predictions, so that reliable ultra-violet spectra can be computed for other objects. The observations will also allow improved model atmospheres to be calculated for RR Lyrae.  The data will also be examined for any effects arising from the pulsation of the star.|Y
RRHRB|IUE Observations of Subdwarfs and RR Lyrae Variables|Roger A.|Bell|Maryland|A series of observations will be carried out for a number of subdwarf stars and two RR Lyrae variables. Four of the subdwarfs are Oke and Gunn standards and their fluxes In the wavelength region 3000 < lambda < 12000 A have been studied intensively. The IUE fluxes will give a test of model atmosphere theory for cool stars and will also test the calibration of the IUE and how well IUE data fits ground based data the overlap region. A number of other subdwarfs, with metal abundances - the range -2 < [M/H] < -0.5, will also be studied. This work is partly a test of model atmosphere theory. However, the observations are also needed to aid in the interpretation of the observations of integrated light of globular clusters. If these observations are corrected for the light from horizontal branch stars, they will give information on cluster ages. The observations of RR Lyrae stars are needed both as a test of the model atmospheres for horizontal branch stars and as a check on the pulsational properties of these stars.|Y
RRLDY|Study of High Velocity 21cm HI Clouds Using RR Lyrae Stars|Donald G.|York|Chicago|The galactic halo includes diffuse high velocity hydrogen clouds (HVC's) seen in 21 cm emission. The distances, physical properties and abundances of these clouds have important implications concerning galactic disk evolution, and QSO absorption line systems. RR Lyrae stars make useful probes of the galactic halo. (They can be observed by IUE to distances of greater than 1 kpc,) The ability of IUE to detect HVC's using RR Lyrae's has been demonstrated. Using RR Lyr stars, the distance to the large HVC Complex C has been shown to be within 1 kpc. We propose to use two other RR Lyrae stars to see if other HVC's are within 1 kpc.|Y
RRLEB|The Companion of the RR Lyrae Star TV Boo|Erika|Bohm-Vitense|Washington|In her study of the RR Lyrae star TV Boo, Claudia Oliveira at the University of British Columbia, measured over a period of 3 days a mean radial velocity of Vr = -110 km/sec, while measurements made a few years earlier had shown V, - -30 km/sec. These measurements indicate orbital motions of a binary. Combining all available measurements an orbital period around 60 days is suggested. The color-color plot of V-I versus B-V is abnormal and indicates a blue companion. This must then be either a white dwarf or a horizontal branch star on the very blue end with decreasing Mv. This then is an extremely interesting binary which for the first time can give direct information about the masses of such stars. We want to observe the blue companion of this RR Lyrae star in order to determine its properties and possibly measure its orbital velocity.|Y
RRMTT|The Blazhko Effect|Terry J.|Teays|CSC - IUE|Observing time is requested to perform the first ultraviolet study of the Blazhko effect. The Blazhko effect is the (mostly) periodic modulation of the shape, amplitude, and time of maximum of the light and radial velocity curves of some RR Lyrae stars. Many models have been proposed to explain the Blazhko effect, but so far there have not been sufficient observational tests to validate or refute any of them. The IUE observing will be complimented by simultaneous ground-based spectroscopy and photometry, carried out by our collaborators at a variety of sites. In the first year of this project we will emphasize obtaining complete ultraviolet light curves, which will be compared to the V and R light curves to look for phase lags, which are predicted by some of the theoretical models, and will help to distinguish between them. These light curves will cover the entire pulsation cycle, including the poorly observed bump phase, and will be acquired at a variety of Blazhko phases. Monitoring of the transient emission in the H and Ca II lines will allow us to correlate the passage of shocks through the star's atmosphere with the pulsation.|Y
RRNTT|The Blazhko Effect|Terry J.|Teays|CSC - IUE Observatory|Observing time is requested to continue and enhance our 13th episode IUE program, which is the first ultraviolet study of the Blazhko effect. The Blazhko effect is the (mostly) periodic modulation of the shape, amplitude, and time of maximum of the light and radial velocity curves of some RR Lyr stars. Many models have been proposed to explain the Blazhko effect, but so far there have not been sufficient observational tests to validate or refute any of them. The IUE observing will be complimented by simultaneous ground-based spectroscopy and photometry, carried out by our collaborators at a variety of sites. In this past year we have emphasized obtaining complete light curves in the LWP wavelength region. These are being compared to the V and R light curves to look for phase lags, which are predicted by some of the theoretical models, and will help to distinguish between them. During the 14th episode we propose to extend these to the SWP wavelengths, as well as looking for variation in the C IV resonance doublet, as a function of Blazhko phase. We will cover the entire pulsation cycle, at a variety of Blazhko phases. We also request two pairs of shifts to make the first high dispersion (LWP) study of the Blazhko effect.|Y
RRODM|Wind Variability of Rapidly Rotating B Supergiants|Derck L.|Massa|Applied Research Corporation|We seek time-resolved, high-resolution IUE spectra of three rapidly rotating BO.5-B1 supergiants over an interval of 6 days to study the behavior of discrete absorption components (DAC) in their winds. The behavior of DAC in rapidly rotating O stars suggests that similar variations should recur frequently and evolve rapidly in our targets, which to date have only shown epoch-to-epoch wind variations. Unlike O stars, the winds of B supergiants display a wider range of ionization stages and their photospheres contain extremely strong lines. These differences provide unique diagnostic capabilities that promise new insights into the physics of the DAC. In particular, we will exploit the coexistence of DAC in Si III and Si IV transitions to obtain the first reliable estimates for the mass of the gas that produces the components. Also, since the strong, largely photospheric triplets of C III and Si III (1175 and 1300, respectively) form at the base of the wind and are shown to vary in conjunction with the wind lines, we will be able to study the formation of DAC much deeper in the wind than previously possible. Thus, we will be able to probe possible photospheric origins for the DAC using only IUE spectra.|Y

RSCCB|Eclipse Coverage of the RS CVN Star: AR LAC|C. Stuart|Bowyer|California|We propose to observe the eclipsing active RS CVn binary AR Lac at various phases of its orbit to unambiguously determine the spatial distribution and intensity of chromospheric activity in this system. The observation will be concurrent with similar observations by HEAO-2 and the VLA, and should allow detailed modelling of the active upper atmospheres. This work should give a much clearer physical picture of ..;hat is happening in RS CVn systems, with implications for the physical understanding of these active systems as well as the general chromospheric-coronal phenomonon.|Y
RSCJL|Target of Opportunity Observations of Flares on RS CVN-Type Binary Systems|Jeffrey L.|Linsky|Colorado|RS CVn-type binaries are close but noncontact systems, which exhibit strong ultraviolet and X-ray emission and which produce extremely energetic flares lasting, for 1-1.0 days. These flares may result from magnetic anihilation, which may occur when large magnetic flux tubes from both stars interact, producing a temporary flux tube connection between the stars and large mass exchange. Our IUE observations of the large flare on UX Ari (1/1/79) show Mg II lines with broad emission wings extending 475 km s^-1 to the red, indicative of a large mass flow towards the G5 star in this system.  We propose to observe two major flare episodes in these systems as target of opportunity observations initiated by the detection of radio flares by P. A. Feldman during his manitoring operations. High dispersion SWP spectra are feasible and needed for the brighter flares in order to detect the flow velocity and physical properties (temperature and density) of the 10^4-2.5 x 10^5 K plasma. Observations at different aspect angles during the flares should determine the geometry of the flaring plasma and the extent of mass exchange between the stars and mass loss from the system.|Y
RSDCB|A Study of RS CVN Stars in the Ultraviolet|C. Stuart|Bowyer|UC Berkrley|The RS CVn binaries offer an opportunity to study the chromospherecorona phenomenon in some of its most active phases. We propose to use the IUE satellite, in conjunction with a similar program using HEAO-2, to study the observational characteristics of these systems in lines formed in the hot upper atmospheres. The HEAO-2 results have shown a clear relation between coronal activity and angular velocity of a star. We will examine this relation for the chromosphere and transition regions of the same stars, to elucidate the extent to which magnetic fields are responsible for producing these regions. Using the full range of data it will also be possible to construct physical models for the complete upper atmospheres of selected illustrative objects. By observing at the appropriate orbital phase for a few of the objects, it will also be possible to gain information on the geometrical distribution of activity on both components of the system.|Y
RSDJL|Studies of the Quiet and Plage Component of the Active Stars in RS CVN Binary Systems|Jeffrey L.|Linsky|Colorado|The present proposal is aimed at continuing the study of chromospheric and transition region line intensity variations in RS CVn stars, started with IUE in 1979, in order to disclose a possible periodic character out of phase with respect to outside of eclipse sinusoidal distortion of the light curve. If this prediction will prove to be true, by subtracting the minimum from the maximum fluxes one can obtain separate spectra of the plage region and of the quiet component. Then, by reasonably estimating the plage filling factor, surface fluxes can be readily obtained and compared with the solar-type models of chromospheric active regions. We propose to compute models for the chromospheres and transition regions of the plage and quiet components separately, and to compare these models with models for plage and quiet regions on the Sun and models previously computed for Capella, HR 1090, and UX Ari. We will also model the spectra of any flare-like event observed.|Y
RSDTA|Timing Capella in the Ultraviolet|Thomas R.|Ayres|Colorado|The long-period RS CVn-type spectroscopic binary system Capella (alpha Aur A: G6 III and F9 III) presents a unique opportunity to study the medium-term time evolution of chromospheric activity on a star that is considerably more active than our Sun. (Note: The rapidly rotating Ftype secondary is responsible for virtually all of the line emission from the Capella system in high excitation species, such as C IV  1548 A and Si IV  1394 A, and for most of the emission in chromospheric species, such as H I L-alpha and Si II 1808 A.) In particular, a recent study of Capella at critical orbital phases has revealed that the ultraviolet output of the system is comparatively steady over timescales of ~hours, but appears to decline somewhat over the three observing sessions, which were separated 26^d apart. Because ultraviolet changes are apparent over month-long timescales, but not over hour-long intervals, it would be extremely valuable to explore the intermediate timescales, namely days, of variability in the Capella secondary's chromospheric output.  One expects, for instance, to see modulations of the ultraviolet emission lines in the Capella spectrum owing to the ~10^d rotational period of the secondary. One might also expect to find longer term modulations (~l month) owing to the birth, evolution and decay of large, bright activity centers. In fact, the amplitude of the rotational modulation provides an indication of how patchy the brightness distribution might be. The patchiness of the chromospheric emission in turn provides an indication of the size-scale spectrum of the emerging magnetic flux elements that are likely ultimately responsible for the chromospheric activity itself.  Finally, a monitoring program extending from one quadrature in the Capella orbit to the othe (54 degrees)  would be quite valuable in searching for and characterizing weak interstellar components in the prominent chromospheric emission features, the O I triplet near 1305 A and Si II 1808 A for example.  I outline below an observing program to obtain a timing record, at high dispersion, of the ultraviolet output of an active chromosphere star the Capella secondary - that is very different from the better studied, but more mundane, solar example. Such a comparison should prove invaluable in exploring the mechanisms responsible for magnetic flux generation in stars, and the ultimate expression of the magnetic fields in chromospheric activity.|Y
RSEBB|Rotational Modulation of FK COM & HD 199178|Bernard W.|Bopp|Toledo|The first observations with the IUE of the variables FK Com and HD 199178 (Bopp and Stencel 1981 Ap.J. 247, L141) showed that these stars have exceptionally bright far-UV line emission, comparable with RS CVn binaries. Line variations were also discovered in the pair of spectra of each obtained thus far. These objects superficially appear to be RS CVn-like, except that there are stringent upper limits to their radial velocity variations and they exhibit v sin i of order of 100 km/sec, greatly in excess of most RS CVns. Variations in the H-alpha  emission profile have led Walter (1981, thesis) to hypothesize that FK Com is the primary of a high mass ratio, semidetached, close binary, accreting material on a thermal timescale from a Roche lobe overflowing secondary. Alternately, in evolutionary scenarios proposed by Webbink (1976 Ap.J. 209, 829), FK Com may be the rapidly rotating single star resulting from the coalescence of an evolving W UMa close binary.  We propose to carefully reobserve FK Com and HD 199178 with the IUE to determine periodic emission line variability and to test these binary models. Walter's model predicts the phase of maximum flux, temperature dependent emission line flux modulation and possible eclipse effects from the degenrate like secondary. Although HD 199178 shows characteristics similar to FK Com, we hope to discriminate between rapidly rotating single star and accretion onto a non-degenerate object hypotheses, using IUE observations.|Y
RSERP|Rotational Coupling of Chromospheric Activity in RS CVN Binary Stars|Ronald A.|Parise|CSC|Observations of RS CVn binary stars in the soft X-rays reveal a relationship between rotation period and coronal activity. The interpretation of this effect is that the stellar magnetic field is being excited by dynamo action resulting from the stars rotation. The soft X-ray observations also suggest a discontinuity in this relationship at a period of approximately l2 days. This discontinuity is predicted by current dynamo theory as a transition from single to multiple excited modes.  We propose to further the argument for the dynamo model by observing chromospheric emission in selected RS CVn stars over a wide range of periods. These new observations will be used in conjunction with the large body of existing IUE data to determine whether or not this relationship, and its characteristic discontinuity, are substantiated in the ultraviolet.|Y
RSESB|The Two Component Atmosphere of Lambda Andromedae|Sallie L.|Baliunas|Harvard CFA - SAO|From optical and ultraviolet observations, Lambda Andromedae has been found to show a clear dichotomy In the structure of its atmosphere which is strikingly similar to that found in the Sun between active regions and the quiet Sun or coronal holes. We propose to measure at high resolution the widths, fluxes and asymmetries of ultraviolet lines formed in the extended atmosphere of the primary to detect the presence and character of a stellar wind and the change in atmospheric structure when active regions and/or spots are present.  Frequent observations In the Mg II transition will be made in an attempt to detect the high chomosphere equivalent of the rapid (~ 5 minutes) fluctuations discovered in the Ca K emission cores suggesting impulsive events.|Y
RSETA|Far-Ultraviolet Echelle Spectra of RS CVN Giants|Thomas R.|Ayres|Colorado|RS Canum Venaticorum systems, containing late-type main-sequence and subgiant stars, are tidally-synchronized binaries that are among the brightest far-ultraviolet and x-ray sources known. Such systems very likely owe their enhanced chromospheric and coronal emission to intense surface magnetic activity driven, in turn, by the interaction of rapid rotation with strong subsurface convection. The RS CVn binaries are valuable prototypes for investigating how magnetic -flux is generated in stars, how the surface magnetic fields are expressed structurally, and how the atmospheres of cool stars respond physically to intense magnetic activity.  Of special importance among the RS CVn binaries are the moderateperiod (P ~ 20 day) subclass containing evolved giant stars. Such systems represent the extreme of low surface gravities, and consequently are critically important in any effort to understand how chromospheric activity might be modified by gross stellar parameters. The RS CVn giants also are pivotal in the question of how the development of strong stellar winds among the later giants might affect the expression of magnetic activity: Does the wind directly smother the formation of high-temperature coronal magnetic loops? Does the wind, instead, merely play a secondary role, for example shortcircuiting magnetic activity by spinning down the star and thereby quenching dynamo action? We propose to extend our previous studies of the classical shortperiod RS CVn systems HR 1099 and UX Arietis, and that of the long period Capella system, to an investigation of moderate period (20 day) RS CVn binaries that contain evolved giant stars. We intend to search for the as yet unseen secondary stars, by observing the systems at critical orbital phases; for massive stellar winds, by detecting Doppler shifts of far-ultraviolet emission features or absorption components in Mg II h and k; and for opacity broadening of the hightemperature lines caused by significant geometrical extension of the emitting structures. Such studies are central to understanding the exotic and energetic phenomena associated with chromospheric and coronal magnetic activity among late-type stars in the solar neighborhood.|Y
RSETS|A Period-Activity Relation for Active RS CVN Stars|Theodore|Simon|Hawaii|Soft X ray observations of RS CVn binaries point to a correlation between L x /Lbol (the X ray to bolometric luminosity ratio that measures the coronal heating rate) and Omega (the stellar angular velocity). This correlation is almost certainly caused by a stellar dynamo, operating in rapidly-rotating late-type stars with deep convection zones. We are proposing to extend the X ray "rotation-activity relation" to the uv transition region and chromospheric emission lines observable with IUE.  If the non-radiative heating rates of stellar transition regions and chromospheres are determined largely by magnetic processes associated with a stellar dynamo, then a similar correlation may be found. We have selected a group of recently discovered active long-period systems, which we believe will be very bright at uv wavelengths. One important goal of this program is to determine whether past studies of the "rotation-activity connection" have been compromised by the omission of active long-period RS CVn systems.|Y
RSFJL|Surface Structure of Eclipsing and Non-Eclipsing RS CVN Systems|Jeffrey L.|Linsky|Colorado - JILA|This proposal is to extend our collaborative IUE study of chromospheric and transition region line flux variations in RS CVn-stars by observing and analyzing periodic emission line flux changes out-of-phase with respect to the noneclipse sinusoidal distortion of the light curve, as well as studying changes during eclipses.  In 1981 we observed with IUE three RS CVn systems (HR 1099, II Peg, and AR Lac) at regular intervals throughout their 2.0-6.7 day periods (collaborative NASA-ESASERC program). We found clear evidence for chromospheric and TR line flux variability, correlated in antiphase with the photometric variability, and of variable line profile asymmetries with phase. By subtracting the minimum from the maximum fluxes, we obtained approximate spectra of the plage region and of the quiet component. The resulting plage surface fluxes are up to several orders of magnitude larger than those of chromospheric and TR lines in solar plages.  The primary objective of the present proposal is to use the moving screen of one star as it eclipses a spotted star to determine the fractional area coverage of active regions (plages), the atmospheric properties and structures of these resolved active regions and how they differ from quiescent regions, and the extent to which the active regions do overlie the dark spots. We propose to compute models of the plage and quiet components separately by matching observed fluxes in lines of Mg II, Si II-IV, C II-IV and N V and by comparison with density-sensitive line ratios. moreover, line profile asymmetry vs. orbital phase will be investigated for the purpose of studying the active region geometry and mass flow in loops in binary systems.  We will also model the spectra of any flare-like event observed. Coordinated ground-based coverage in optical and radio hands is being organized.|Y
RSFTS|Chromospheric Activity and Binary Interaction in 39 Ceti|Theodore|Simon|Hawaii|In a study of the relation between ultraviolet emission line strengths and rotation period for active RS CVn stars. we have recently observed the bright X ray Source, 39 Ceti. This star has a prominent photometric wave, presumably from large starspots that modulate the Visual light curve as the star rotates, but its spectral lines are narrow and indicate a projected rotation rate < 15 km s^-1. In our SWP spectrum Of 39 Ceti, we have discovered a hot stellar continuum, whose flux peaks below 1215A, and a very broad Lyman-alpha absorption line. In a preliminary analysis of the data, we are able to match the secondary spectrum with a (25,000 K, log g = 9) white dwarf model of Wesemael et al. (1980).  Superimposed on this hot continuum are high excitation emission lines characteristic of RS CVn chromospheres and transition regions, e.q., C IV 1549A and N V. In this proposal we are requesting further time on IUE to observe 39 Ceti at eight different phases in its activity cycle in order to study the variability of the UV emission lines and shortwavelength continuum. Our observations will provide an empirical test of two possible models -for the UV emission lines- the lines may be formed in the chromosphere and transition region of the active G5 primary, as in other spotted stars; or they may be formed in an X-ray heated wind from the primary that is accreted onto the white dwarf secondary, i.e., by binary interaction.|Y
RSGDH|Investigation of Gas Streams in the RS CVN Binaries SZ Piscium and RT Lacertae|David P.|Huenemoerder|Penn State University|SZ Piscium and RT Lacertae are two RS CVn systems which have displayed evidence for gas streams in the visible. They are both very likely only semi-detached binaries and both exhibit several characteristics common to Algol type systems known to have gas streams and/or disks. It is here proposed to observe these two stars during eclipses in the long wavelength region at high resolution. It is expected that any gas streams will show as asymmetries or high velocity components in the resonance lines of magnesium and iron. These spectra will answer three important questions. First and foremost they will determine whether circumstellar gas is present. Secondly, if such gas is -present, they will allow us to assess its contribution to the observed stellar activity. Lastly, we will be able to explore the regime of occurrence of gas streaming as well as to better constrain the physical conditions present.|Y
RSGFW|Variable MGII Asymmetries in FK Comae Berenices|Frederick M.|Walter|Colorado - JILA|We propose to obtain 5 deep LWP-HI exposures of the MgII resonance lines of FK Com to investigate the variable asymmetries of these lines. Existing data hints at line profile changes that repeat on the photometric period, which we interpret as evidence for streaming from the secondary to the G giant primary at velocities of ~400 km s^-1. If the existence of this streaming is confirmed, then measurements of the velocity and phasing of the streaming may confirm the binary model for FK Com, and give important insights into the atmospheric structure of a G giant which is gaining mass at some 10^-7 M(sun) yr^-1. We also propose to obtain absolute velocities for the MgII absorption components, which are presumably stellar, and study the motions of density inhomogeneities in the atmosphere (by a Doppler imaging technique). FK Com is one of the most peculiar stars in the sky; these observations can confirm the binary nature of the system and its interpretation as a short lived phase in the evolution of an Algol system. We request 5 US1 and 2 1/2 US2 shifts, 1 1/2 shifts per day for 5 consecutive days.|Y
RSGJL|Determination  Size/Physical Properties of Active Regions inRS CVn Sys Rotational Modulation/Doppler Imaging|Jeffrey|Linsky|University of California|The primary objective of this proposal is to determine the geometric size and physical properties of active regions in two properly chosen bright RS CVn systems.. Previous observing campaigns by this group, and especially our observations of II Peg in October 1981, have indicated that RS CVn systems with simple, nearly sinusoidal photometric waves of large amplitude have one dominant active region and large amplitude variations in the transition region and chromospheric ultraviolet emission lines as the active region rotates on to and off of the visible hemisphere. We propose to determine the size of this active region by rotational modulation of the line fluxes obtained at least 12 times over a period. We will confirm the existence of this active region by observing the Doppler shift of the emission lines when the active region -is near both limbs, a technique called Doppler imaging.  Once the size, latitude, and longitude of the active region are determined, we can determine the emission line surface fluxes for the active region alone from the line flux enhancements. We can then compute models of the active region and quiet components separately using emission measure techniques or by matching computed and observed surface fluxes in lines of Mg II, Si II-IV, C II-IV, and N V and by comparison with density-sensitive line ratios. As before, we will set up a major coordinated observing campaign to obtain radio observations (VLA), optical photometry, and optical spectroscopy.|Y
RSGTA|Ultraviolet Observations of the Limb-Crossing of an Active Region on Sigma Geminorum|Thomas R.|Ayres|Colorado-Lasp|We propose to study, at high dispersion, the behavior of the ultraviolet emission line spectrum of the RS CVn-type binary Sigma Geminorum (KI III + ?) as an optically identified starspot group rotates over the limb of the K giant and onto the visible hemisphere. The scientific goal is to distinguish between the two most promising hypotheses to explain the significant changes that were observed in a pair of IUE SWP echelle images of Sigma Gem taken over consecutive days in May 1982: (1) a flare which occurred near the receding limb of the giant (or near disk center but accompanied by significant downflows of 10^5 K material); or (2) the rotation off of the visible hemisphere of a small-scale, but bright, active region associated with a previously identified optical starspot group. We feel that the behavior of similar systems, like II Peg, favors the second hypothesis. If so, a mechanism must operate in the cool, fast rotating giants to produce a significant spatial concentration of the decaying magnetic fields that are thought to be responsible for the enormously enhanced far-ultraviolet emissions of the RS CVn-type binaries.  We believe that it is essential to understand why the "activity" on the cool giants can become so concentrated and intense. An important way to explore in detail the physical association of high excitation active regions with photospheric starspot groups is to use the technique of "Doppler, Imaging", developed by Vogt and collaborators to study the changing profiles of absorption features in the spectra of fast rotating late-type stars. We have applied the emission-line analog of the approach previously to the shortperiod RS CVn system, HR 1099, and propose to continue our work in the 7th-year of IUE with a study of Sigma Gem. In addition, we intend to search for the occurrence of flare activity in Si IV and C IV by monitoring the farultraviolet spectrum of a Gem at low dispersion. As a novel twist to the program, we intend to arrange simultaneous coverage with the Very Large Array to explore the association of the microwave corona of a Gem with the farultraviolet emission regions and optical starspots.  [Note: this program could be easily integrated into an ITF recalibration effort for the LWP, LWR and SWP cameras: The optimum observing window is in late February or early March, before Spring shadow season.]|Y
RSHDG|An IUE-Archive Search for Doppler Imagable Chromospheres in Active Stars|David M.|Gibson|New Mexico Tech|We have recently become the first to use IUE data to doppler-image active chromospheric regions on another star, AR Lacertae. This RS CVn binary was shown to have a prominent active region seen in high-resolution MgII images which was extended (long. 600) and equatorially-confined lat < 25 degrees). The active-region apparently lies below the brightest part of the x-ray corona detected by two of us (FMW,DMG) using Einstein. Another active region, or flare site, was also detected nearly half-way around the star; it too was near the equator. If we can doppler-image the chromospheres of other active stars in MgII as well, we believe these data can be used to establish the fundamental spatial relationships between spots, active-chromospheres, and stellar coronae. As a first step we wish to reprocess and examine the existing high-resolution MgII images of some RS CVn binaries and other rapidly- rotating active stars (e.g. post T-Tauri stars). We will search for "satellite" features superposed on their rotationally-broaden "main" lines. As far as we are able, we will attempt to model the surface brightness of these stars in MgII and correlate these data with other data related to their stellar activity.|Y
RSHLR|Coordinated Observations of Rotational Modulation in Long   Period RS CVn Systems|Lawrence|Ramsey|Pennsylvania State University|This proposal requests IUE time to obtain SWP low dispersion spectra during 10 US2 shifts during the Fall of 1985. The targets are all late G or early K giants in long period active chromosphere RS Canum Venaticorum binary systems. The research goal is to discern the spatial relationship and extent of the surface active regions in both the horizontal and vertical directions. Ground based observations will be obtained contemporaneously over the fall season. We will use the C IV line as the primary activity indicator in the stellar transition region, whereas ground based observations will supply information on the chromosphere and photosphere. We will particularly be seeking information on the relative shape and phase lead or lag of the transition region emission relative to the chromospheric and photospheric rotational phase behavior.|Y
RSIDH|Investigation of Mass Transfer in the RS CVN Binary, RT Lacertae|David P.|Huenemoerder|Penn State|Optical spectroscopy of RT Lac has strongly indicated that the system is semi-detached and is undergoing a period of steady mass transfer. The geometry is such that a gas stream impacts upon the mass gaining component. The resultant hot spot would display high excitation emission lines in the short wavelength region as available to IUE. Since RT Lac also has an active chromosphere, some of these lines would be present at all times, but line ratios would be highly phase dependent. it is here proposed to observe RT Lac at two phases near opposite elongations with IUE in the low resolution mode and with the short wavelength camera; exposures will also be made with the long wavelength camera in low dispersion to assess the continuum flux and Mg II emission. It is important to assess the presence and magnitude of mass transfer in this system, since it is near the boundary in mass where theories state that steady, rather than intermittent, transfer occurs.|Y
RSIEG|Long-Term Evolution of Chromospheric, Transiteric, Transition-Region & Starspot Activity in V711 Tau|Edward|Guinan|Villanova|We propose to extract, from the archival IUE spectra of the RS CVn binary V711 Tau (HR 1099) available from 1978 to the present, the emission fluxes of the prominent chromospheric and transition -region lines in both IUE wavelength regimes, in order to trace the long-term development of active regions on the the active component of the system, and to examine its correlation with variations in starspot and plage activity inferred from visible-band observations. For the interval 1978 to 1985 we have found, from our own optical observations, a pattern of systematic increase in the mean brightness of the system, produced by an overall 50% reduction in the total spot coverage, accompanied by a steady decrease in the chromospheric H-alpha emission, while at the same time the star becomes steadily bluer. These changes are explicable in terms of a general decrease in the photospheric and chromospheric activity of the star from 1978 to 1985. A detailed study of the emission-line variations in the IUE spectra will enable us to follow the development of active regions at different heights in the stellar atmosphere during the 8-year interval for which IUE data exist, and will be related to the activity in the lower chromosphere and photosphere deduced from the optical observations. This type of investigation has not yet been undertaken for any RS CVn system. V711 Tau is a particularly suitable candidate for such a study, being wellobserved optically and with the IUE, as well as at radio and X-ray wavelengths. We can now be reasonably confident of our ability to interpret activity in the photosphere since similar conclusions about spot temperature, area and general location have been deduced by different authors using different techniques. The IUE spectra will reveal, in cross section, the activity pattern in the upper lavers of the stellar atmosphere of this active star..|Y
RSIJL|Study of Active Regions on the K Star Components of RS CVN and HD 5303|Jeffrey L.|Linsky|Colorado - JILA|Our previous IUE observations of RS CVn systems have shown that the MgII lines exhibit phase-dependent asymmetries. Using such data we have applied Doppler imaging techniques to reconstruct a large scale picture of chromospheric active regions on the stellar surfaces of both components of the RS CVn-type system AR Lac. Photometric observations of such systems indicate large spotted regions, which are probably aggregates of small spots. High spatial resolution to permit mapping of small structures in the MgII bright regions can be achieved only during the eclipse of the active component.  We propose to observe two RS CVn systems, RS CVn itself and HD 5303, from before first contact until after fourth contact during the secondary eclipse (when the active K star is behind). These systems are particularly suitable for study by IUE because the primary components are of early spectral type (F6V and F0V) and do not show any MgII emission. Thus any change in the MgII emission profile can be easily detected as active regions are eclipsed or reappear.  We will observe each system continuously during secondary eclipse with consecutive ESA-US1 shifts, obtaining a LWP-HI spectrum every 85 min and 70 min for RS CVn and HD 5303, respectively. Doppler imaging techniques will allow us to reconstruct the surface distribution of MgII and to determine the location and size of active regions in these very active stars. We will compare these data with photospheric and coronal information obtained from our photometric, Xray, and radio observations.|Y
RSIJS|Monitoring the RS CVN Star II Peg|J. H.|Swank|NASA/GSFC|We propose to continue our program of simultaneous IUE and EXOSAT observations of the RS CVn star II Peg. Our observations in July 1985 showed only small modulations in emission line strengths during the 6.7 day orbital period, in contrast to the strong variations seen by Marstad et al. 1982. Those variations could have been due to flare activity, rather than the photometric wave and plage region. However the July 1985 EXOSAT observations covered a strong X-ray flare which was not accompanied by very significant increases in line fluxes. Taken together, the data imply a variety of types of flames or of optical and X-ray correlations. Since x-ray observations are an essential key to the flaming activity and the coronal loop structures and have only been obtained for our observations for a significant part of one orbital period, we now wish to monitor for at least two orbital periods in order to separate orbital variations from erratic flare activity and to investigate the reproducibility of the flare characteristics. IUE coverage would be used to establish the energy budget of any flares detected and constrain the role of conduction in cooling flare regions.|Y
RSISD|A Survey of Short-Period RS CVN Binaries|Stephen A.|Drake|SASC|We propose to observe a number of active, late-type binary systems with periods of around one day or less, so as to investigate the structure of chromospheres and transition regions in solar-type stars that, due to tidal synchronism, have rapid rotation rates of 25 to 100 km/sec. We will determine the existence of functional dependences of ultraviolet line fluxes on quantities such as period, Rossby number, and spectral type within this class of systems. We will compare the spectra of these systems to the shorterperiod W UMa contact binary systems and to RS CVn binaries of longer period, in order to verify whether there is a "global" rotation-activity relation for the entire range of rotation rates seen in late-type binary stars, or whether, on the other hand, there is evidence for "breaks" in the relation at certain critical periods. We will use these data to provide constraints on the dynamo models for generating activity in rotating, convective stars.|Y
RSITA|A Deep, Doppler-Compensated, SWP Echellogram of HR 1099|Thomas R.|Ayres|Colorado - CASA|I, and my ESA collaborators, propose to apply a novel observing technique to the classical shortperiod (2.8 d) RS CVn binary HR 1099 (K0 IV + G5 V) - the paradigm of magnetic activity among the nearby stars of late spectral type. The program involves a long-duration exposure (25 hours or more) of the far-ultraviolet (1150-2000 A) spectrum in high dispersion (0.15 A resolution) in which the image of the target is periodically stepped in the large aperture along the dispersion axis in order to compensate for the orbital Doppler shifts of the K0 primary, which largely by virtue of its size completely dominates the ultraviolet emission of the system. We also propose to obtain very high-quality maps of the middle-ultraviolet (2000-3200 A) spectrum using graded sequences of LWP exposures obtained at nonstandard positions in the large aperture, and combined by means of a filtering technique that largely eliminates defects like reseau marks and cosmic-ray hits.  The major objectives of the program are to: Search for persistent redshifts of the high-excitation (105 K) emissions, above the smoothed background of "Doppler-imaged" surface structure; identify weak blends near important diagnostic lines, which otherwise might be misconstrued as Dopplerimaged features; measure the profiles of weak, but important, emissions like the N V doublet (1240 A), 0 V] (1218 A), and the O I triplet near 1305 A; attempt to detect coronal forbidden lines like [Fe XII]; and evaluate the high-pressure limit of chromospheric density diagnostics like C II] (2325 A).  The observations of HR 1099 also will be valuable for long-term monitoring programs and efforts to construct a high-dispersion atlas of late type stars.|Y
RSJJL|Intrinsic Hydrogen Lyman Alpha Profile of AR Lacertae|Jeffrey L.|Linsky|Colorado - JILA|We propose to acquire high-resolution spectra of the H I Lyman-alpha (Ly-alpha) emission line (1216 A) of the eclipsing binary RS CVn system AR Lacertae. The velocity difference between opposite quadratures will cause a wavelength shift in the stellar profiles of about 0.6 A with respect to the interstellar absorption line center. By obtaining high-dispersion spectra at successive quadratures, we will be able to recover that portion of the intrinsic stellar Ly-alpha profile that is generally obscurred by interstellar absorption and thereby determine the intrinsic profiles of both components of AR Lac. Once we know the intrinsic shape of the profile, we will be able to correct for the geocoronal and interstellar contributions in existing SWP-LO spectra of AR Lac and other active stars so that we can determine the surface flux of Ly-alpha. We will obtain additional short low-resolution exposures that will allow us to test and calibrate our techniques for performing these corrections. We will incorporate the surface flux measurements into the multi-component models that we are constructing for this star. Discrete plage emission components seen on the Mg II k lines might also be visible on the Ly-alpha profile. If so, we will be able to obtain the Ly-alpha surface flux within the plage regions alone.|Y
RSJTA|Deep SWP-HI of Lux Arietis|Thomas R.|Ayres|Colorado - CASA|In the Ninth Episode of the IUE, I and my collaborators applied a novel observing technique to the 2.8-day RS CVn binary HR 1099 (KO IV+G5 V) the paradigm of magnetic activity among the nearby stars of late spectral type - to record high S/N profiles of a diverse range of chromospheric (6,000 K) and transition-zone (10^5 K) emissions. The program involved a 19.5-hour highdispersion exposure of the far-ultraviolet (1150-2000 A) spectrum in which the image of the target periodically was stepped in the large aperture to compensate for the changing orbital Doppler shifts of the active K0 primary. The success of the observation has encouraged us to attempt the same technique on another prototype RS CVn: the 6.4-day system UX Arietis (K0 IV+G5 V), which is very similar in its properties to HR 1099, aside from the longer orbital period (and hence slower synchronous rotational velocities).  The major objectives of the program are to: search for evidence of gasdynamic flows in the high-excitation emissions like C IV 1548; measure the profiles of weak, but important, emissions like Si IV 1394 and O I 1305; evaluate the high-pressure limit of chromospheric density diagnostics like C II] 2325; and measure the relative "activity" of the G-type secondary star.  A detailed comparison of the high-dispersion spectra of UX Ari and HR 1099 should reveal, through any differences, important properties of the magneticallydisturbed outer atmospheres of the "classical" RS CVn stars.|Y
RSKFW|Spectral Imaging of EI Eridani|Frederick M.|Walter|Colorado - CASA|We will obtain a series of high-resolution spectra of the Mg II k line of the singlelined, non-eclipsing RS CVn-type system EI Eri. These spectra will be used to determine the size, location, and brightness of plages in its chromosphere. Atmospheric models will then be generated for the plage regions alone using the rotational modulation of the SWP emission lines to derive their far-uv spectra and the spectral imaging results to determine their surface areas.  We have developed procedures to use a series of IUE high-dispersion Mg II k spectra of rapidly rotating, active stars to construct a series of images of their chromospheres. These spectral imaging techniques have previously been applied only to the spectra of AR Lac, which is a double-lined, eclipsing RS CVntype system. Because EI Eri is single-lined, any large-scale non-uniformities in the distribution of plages in its chromosphere will produce an unambiguous signature on the observed line profile. The analysis of these profiles will be free of line blending, which is especially pronounced near the eclipses of AR Lac. More importantly, because EI Eri is inclined to the line of sight, we will be able to directly measure the detailed shapes of the plages. The AR Lac data only allow us to measure longitudinal extents.  Our results will be compared with simultaneous ground-based observations of EI Eri to synthesize a 3dimensional picture of the atmosphere from the photosphere to the base of the corona. We will also compare our results to those previously obtained for AR Lac using the same technique to determine the general behavior of the plages in RS CVn systems. We will then be able to begin to address the relationships between gross stellar properties and chromospheric structure.|Y
RSKLR|Coordinated Observations of FK Comae|Lawrence W.|Ramsey|Penn State|This proposal requests IUE time to obtain SWP low dispersion spectra during ten US2 half shifts. The target is FK Comae. The research goal is to obtain a complete UV and optical data set over just a few rotational periods of this star. In an attempt to better understand this peculiar object we will correlate the activity indicators in the visible region with those in the UV. Ground based observations will be obtained contemporaneously and simultaneously where possible. The IUE data will primarily provide information on activity in the stellar transition region through transitions of N V, C IV and Si IV in the SWP spectral region. Lines such as C II sample the high chromosphere whereas the ground based data will supply information on the low chromosphere and photosphere. Mg II data will also be obtained to supplement the ground based data and to provide velocity resolution within the observed profile. The proposed program will lead to a unique data set on this interesting star and will allow progress toward understanding it and similar systems.|Y
RSKTA|Doppler-Dissection of UX Arietis|Thomas R.|Ayres|Colorado - CASA|UX Arietis (K0 IV+G5 V) is a 6.4-day period RS CVn binary - near the peak of magnetic "activity" among stars of late spectral type - that recently was subjected to intense scrutiny with the IUE, including a very-deep (1265-min exposure) SWP-HI spectrum. We wish to continue our study of this hyperactive system by conducting a unique series of LWP-HI measurements of Mg II A2800 at ten phases near consecutive orbital velocity extrema. We intend to subject the spectra to "Doppler dissection", a powerful technique to extract information concerning spatial nonuniformities on the surfaces of rapidly-rotating stars from recurring distortions in chromospheric emission profiles.  Our objective is to understand why the "hyperactive" chromospheres still exhibit substantial spatial irregularities, instead of being completely covered by intense, uniform magnetic plage as the solar analogy would suggest. We will approach this question by identifying the typical sizes and surface fluxes of chromospheric nonuniformities on UX Ari (in addition to other representative close binaries we have observed previously); and attempt to deduce, through numerical modelling, the physical properties and total heating rates of the enhanced regions. The derived physical quantities, in turn, can guide the development of theories of the heating processes and thermal-instability mechanisms that might lead to the natural formation of chromospheric inhomogeneities.  In order to take advantage of specialized algorithms to filter camera defects from IUE spectrograms, we propose to acquire a graded sequence, of echellograms at independent locations on the LWP camera (by placing the target image at offcenter positions in the large aperture). The scheme not only extends the dynamic range and improves S/N, but it also mitigates the influence of any persistent artifacts of the vidicon images that are not eliminated in the nominal IUESIPS processing or by our spike- removal procedures.|Y
RSLBB|Ultraviolet Observations of Extremely Active Lithium-Rich RS CVN Stars|Bernard W.|Bopp|Toledo|Using optical spectroscopy, we have investigated four bright (V = 6-7) G-K stars known to have strong Ca II H and K emission. The objects turn out to be RS CVn binaries with newly derived orbital periods ranging from 4 to >50 days. The optical activity signatures are extremely (and perhaps anomalously) strong in all four stars. At least two of the stars show H-alpha as an emission feature above the continuum, a characteristic of only the most active RS CVn systems such as V711 Tau and 11 Peg. The He I D3 line is seen as an strong absorption feature in all four stars. Curiously, all the stars show the Li I 6707 A line as a fairly strong absorption feature (EW = 60-100 mA), which may be explained by the presence of very large cool spots. We propose to obtain IUE observations to study the chromospheric and transition-region activity in these stars. IUE will provide quantitative flux data that can be compared with the existing optical data to gauge and verify the very high level of activity suggested by the optical signatures. HD 119285 rotates slowly enough to permit us to also obtain simultaneous high-resolution optical spectroscopy suitable for magnetic field measures.|Y
RSLFW|Fourth Epoch Doppler-Imaging Observations of AR Lacertae|Frederick M.|Walter|Colorado - CASA|We undertook Mg II k Doppler imaging observations of the eclipsing RS CVn system AR Lacertae in 1983, 1985, and 1987. These observations have revealed the presence of distinct bright regions (plages) on the K star, cyclic variations in the global Mg II surface flux and line width from both stars, a dark hemisphere on the G star, flaring regions on both stars, possible Mg II k emission from the center of mass of the system, and long-term changes in the structure of the lower chromospheres of the stars. We propose here to continue our biennial monitoring. Our goal is to study the evolution of the structure of the lower chromospheres of both stars. These proposed observations will extend our baseline to six years, permitting us to track the plage migration and to better determine their lifetimes.|Y
RSLJN|Simultaneous X-Ray and Ultraviolet Observations of Flares on RS CVn Stars|James E.|Neff|NASA/GSFC|We propose to observe the RS CVn star II Pegasi simultaneously in the ultraviolet, X-ray, and optical. Our aim is to study the dynamics of flares on RS CVn systems, which can be five orders of magnitude more energetic than the largest solar flare. X-ray observations will permit an estimate for the flare size and density in the 10^6 K region, and the ultraviolet data will provide an estimate of the electron density and flare size in the transition region, Highresolution, time-resolved spectra of flares will be used to study systematic and turbulent motions within the chromosphere during the flare. High-resolution ground-based spectra will be used to determine whether there are photospheric counterparts or reactions to flares.|Y
RSLWK|High Resolution Studies of the Ultraviolet Lines in O-B Stars|Lucas W.|Kamp|Boston University|Objectives:  The strong Ultraviolet(UV) resonance lines have a unique importance to understanding stellar atmospheres for several reasons (a) they are generally formed in higher layers of the atmosphere than are the continuous spectrum and the visual lines. They are thus the only indicators of these layers, which are of importance both as a part of the star and as the interface between the star and the interstellar medium, (b) as these lines arise from the most highly populated levels of their ions, their formation is less influenced by interlocking effects of other levels than is of visual lines. Therefore they are more direct indicators of atmospheric structure and abundances than are most other spectral features. We would like to make use of the features mentioned above in two projects involving high-resolution studies of UV lines.|Y
RSMDH|Fixed-Phase Variability in RS CVN Stars|David P.|Huenemoerder|Penn State University|RS CVn stars display three types of activity: rotational modulation of activity sensitive features, short-term variability ("flares"), and long term activity cycles. Short term variability can often confound interpretation of data from different epochs as well as during one or two rotations. In order to determine the level of stochastic variability (i.e., that NOT due to rotational modulation) over a short time period, we propose to obtain several spectra at a relatively fixed phase for each of the four targets, AR Lac, SZ Psc, Z Her, and El Eri. These targets have periods amenable to such a program - near integral multiples of two or four days, so that if observed once every four days over a period of three weeks, the relative phases will have changed very little. Exposures with the short wavelength camera will provide emission line diagnostics of the high chromosphere and transition region, while the long wavelength region will give the Mg II lines of the mid-chromosphere. Contemporaneous optical spectra will be obtained of Ca II H and K, infrared triplet, He D3, and of the Balmer lines. In addition to discerning the amplitude of typical variations with height of formation, line ratios should be able to distinguish flare-like events with variable ratios from the possible rapid growth and decay of prominences, for example, which should have fairly constant ratios.|Y
RSMEG|Activity Cycles in Stars with Highly Active Chromospheres|Edward F.|Guinan|Villanova|We propose to carry out IUE observations of the highly active RS CVn binaries V711 Tauri. Lambda Andromadas, II Peg, and UX Arietis over the next 2 years (1990 and 1991). These stars have the most extensive IUE archival coverage for stars of this type. and have almost continuous ground-based photometric coverage from about 1975 onward. In addition we shall investigate the activity of the rapidly rotating spotted early-G giant FK Comae, for which there is also considerable archival IUE material, and ground-based coverage from 1982. We aim to trace the long-term development of chromospheric can transition-region activity an the active components of these stars. Optical observations indicate the presence of large and variable starspot regions (up to 30% of the stellar surface). A detailed study of the UV emission-line fluxes will enable us to follow the variations In chromospheric and TR activity over an interval of 0 to 10 years. The main aim of the proposed research is the investigation of the long-term relationship between active regions and starspots in these RS CVn stars, and the further elucidation of the rate played by white-light faculae in affecting the overall irradiance of the star as in the case of V711 Tau and the Sun.  In 1990 the opportunity of obtaining X-ray observations with ROSAT will be available. The targets are all bright X-ray sources, and easily detectable with ROSAT during the Initial All-Sky Survey. We request coordinated IUE-ROSAT observations of the targets as for as possible. This extends the Investigation out to the stellar coronae. We are planning coordinated ground-based photoelectric photometry, polarimetry, optical spectroscopy, and VLA observations in addition.  We shall determine the activity-related changes in the physical properties and structure of the stellar atmospheres from the photosphere to the corona, including temperature, density. electron pressure, and filling factors using emission-measure analysis, density sensitive line ratios, and spot modeling of the tight curves.  It is important to ensure that the value of a significant body of IUE data as a source of information on activity cycles in highly active stars is enhanced by continued IUE observations together with monitoring at other wavelengths. A few more years of IUE observations should be sufficient for a definitive study of long term magnetic activity in these stars.|Y
RSMJL|A Three Dimensional Picture of RS CVN Stellar Atmospheres|Jeffrey L.|Linsky|Colorado - JILA|The ROSAT all-sky survey provides a unique opportunity to study an RS CVn system simultaneously at x-ray, EUV, UV, optical, and radio wavelengths at many phases throughout an orbital period. ROSAT can detect the x-ray flux of each candidate system during each 30 second viewing 16 times per day for at least 2 days. We request a block of 7 IUE shifts to obtain NEAR SIMULTANEOUS emission line fluxes (SWP-LO) and Mg IT line profiles (LWP-HI), and we will obtain contemporaneous optical photometry and spectroscopy and VLA radio fluxes (3.6, 6, and 20 cm). one objective of this PROPOSAL is to obtain the FIRST 3-D MODEL OF THE INHOMOGENEOUS PHOTOSPHERE, CHROMOSPHERE, AND CORONA OF A STAR OTHER THAN THE SUN. We will use optical photometry and spectroscopy to map the spotted photospheres of each star, and the Mg II line profiles to DOPPLERIMAGE their chromospheres, to determine the location, size, and surface flux of the active regions. We will then use the time variation of the UV emission line and x-ray fluxes to determine what fluxes are due to the quiet and active regions separately. These data will provide SURFACE FLUXES for the quiet and active regions separately. We will then will model BOTH REGIONS independently using an emission measure analysis. We will also model any flares observed.  The second part of the program will be a simultaneous UV/X-ray SURVEY with the objective of DETERMINING THE RANGE OF PHYSICAL MODELS APPLICABLE TO THE CHROMOSPHERES AND CORONAE OF RS CVN SYSTEMS. We propose to obtain emission line fluxes (SWP-LO) and Mg II line profiles (LWP-HI) of all bright RS CVns observed by ROSAT from mid-July through September 1990 that meet the IUE observing constraints. About 17 systems in the Strassmeier catalog will likely be observed during this period. While many RS CVn systems have been observed separately by IUE and x-ray satellites, SIMULTANEOUS UV and x-ray observations are required to model these spatially inhomogenous and timevariable systems. This research program and the ROSAT RS CVn survey will constitute most of the data for the Ph.D. Thesis of the Lead Investigator, Anthony Veale.|Y
RSNEG|Activity Cycles in Stars with Highly Active Chromospheres|Edward F.|Guinan|Villanova University|We propose to continue IUE observations of the highly active RS CVn Binaries V711 Tauri, Lambda Andromedae, II Peg, and UX Arietis and the rapidly-rotating early-G giant FK Comae. These stars have the most extensive IUE archival coverage for stars of this type and have almost continuous ground-based photometric coverage from about 1975 onward. We aim to trace the long-term development of chromospheric and transition-region activity on the active components of these stars. Optical observations indicate the presence of large and variable starspot regions (up to 30% of the stellar surface). A detailed study of the UV emission-line fluxes will enable us to follow the variations in chromospheric and TR activity over an interval of 8-12 years. We shall try to take advantage of the opportunity of obtaining simultaneous IUE and ROSAT pointed X-ray observations of some of the targets. This will be supported by coordinated ground-based optical and radio observations. The main aim of the proposed research is the investigation of the long-term relationship between active regions and starspots in these highly active stars, and the further elucidation of the role played by whitelight faculae in affecting the overall irradiance of the star as in the case of V711 Tau and the Sun. Extension of the large body of IUE observations of these stars offers the possibility of a definitive study of their long-term magnetic activity.|Y
RSNLR|Quiescent Prominences in Eclipsing RS CVns|Lawrence W.|Ramsey|Penn State University|We propose to observe two eclipsing RS CVn binaries, SS Bootis and AR Monocerotis, to study large extended regions which we believe to be responsible for much of the emission in these systems. Ground-based observations show attenuation of the emission from the eclipsed component in both systems at a point near but not in eclipse. As the eclipse ends, the emission level returns to its average out-of-eclipse value, indicating that a large, obscuring, off-limb feature on the eclipsing component is present. IUE LWPLo observations of the Mg II lines in both systems at the proper phases will provide important data regarding the structure of the emitting regions as well as the degree to which they are responsible for the emission. With combined optical and UV data on these systems we will be able to constrain the size and possibly the optical depth of these structures.|Y
RSPAB|Simultaneous Coronal, TR, and Chromospheric Spectroscopy of HR1099|Alexander|Brown|Colorado - JILA|We request IUE time as a central component of coordinated, contemporaneous, multiwavelength observations designed to study the atmospheric structure and time variability of one of the brightest and most active RS CVn systems - HR1099. We propose to observe this 2.84 day period system over one rotation cycle using newlyavailable observational capabilities to obtain higher quality spectra than ever previously attained. The powerful facilities already guaranteed for our program include EUVE, which will provide the first coronal spectroscopy for this star, and Hubble Space Telescope (HST), which will observe at consecutive quadratures with higher spectral resolution than IUE. HST may also obtain Doppler Imaging data in the Mg II, C IV, Si III, and C III emission lines, spread over one rotation. VLA and Australian Telescope time will be requested to study the nonthermal coronal radio emission.  The IUE observations will provide wider coverage of UV variability due to rotational modulation (and possibly flaring) than possible with HST and will form the overall observational framework in which the data from other instruments will be analyzed. IUE multiwavelength spectroscopy will be used to investigate the coronal and TR emission measure distribution and definitively model the atmospheric structure and energy balance of this prototypical RS CVn system.|Y
RSPJE|Eclipses of Active Regions in RS CVN Binaries|Joel A.|Eaton|CEIS - Tennessee State University|RS CVn binaries are among the most chromospherically active stars known. We have been using a combination of photometry and spectroscopy to define the locations and numbers of spots more reliably in eclipsing RS CVn binaries. We propose to use eclipses of active regions in a similar way to determine where the active regions are located, specifically to see how highly the emission is concentrated around the equator and how it is related to the starspots. We will concentrate on the particularly favorable system SZ Psc, combining photometry from a robotic telescope and highdispersion optical spectroscopy with the IUE spectra.|Y
RSPTA|Coronal Topology|Thomas R.|Ayres|Colorado - CASA|The coronal morphology of the RS Canum Venaticorum binaries has been the subject of considerable debate over the past decade. Are the UV and X-ray bright structures of the subgiant primaries relatively compact, surface-hugging features analogous to the magnetic arcades of solar active regions? Or, do they extend to great altitudes, possibly interacting with their counterparts from the MS secondary star? Given the practical difficulties of directly resolving the high-excitation 'surface' of a distant star, one must resort to proxies. The most useful are: (1) spectral imaging; and (2) "rotational modulations" of inhomogeneous brightness distributions. The techniques are best suited to the fastest-rotating objects, which conveniently also are the most "active" owing to the catalyzing effect of rotation on the generation of magnetic flux in cool stars.  We propose to obtain a unique medium-term (months) sampling of the UV emissions of four bright RS CVn variables, and the related object alpha Aur, in concert with the near-continuous record of coronal intensities provided by the ALEXIS EUV sky-monitor. Our objective is to study the three-dimensional structure of hyperactive atmospheres in their most favorable light.  [Our proposal is substantially identical to an approved 15th-Episode program of the same title. Our current target-of-opportunity program cannot, however, be implemented in the present episode because the launch of ALEXIS has slipped into spring 1993, and the five prime targets will not be available until the fall. Thus, we are renewing our request.]|Y
RSQAB|Simultaneous Coronal, TR, and Chromospheric Spectroscopy of HR1099|Alexander|Brown|Colorado - JILA|We request IUE time as a central component of coordinated, contemporaneous, multiwavelength observations designed to study the atmospheric structure and time variability of one of the brightest and most active RS CVn systems - HR1099. We propose to observe this 2.84 day period system over > one rotation cycle using newlyavailable observational capabilities to obtain higher quality spectral information than ever previously attained. The IUE observations would be coordinated with coronal spectroscopy from the EUVE and ASCA (Astro-D) satellites. VLA and Australian Telescope time will be requested to study the nonthermal coronal radio emission.  In September 1993 we conducted a similar campaign coordinated with HST/GHRS, EUVE, and radio telescopes. During this week long period HR1099 underwent incredibly high levels of activity; significant flares were seen in all six IUE shifts (two extremely large), EUVE showed considerable flaring (its spectrum being visible even against the daytime background!) and in the radio HR1099 was a 0.3 Jansky source for most of the time. This emphasizes the important role that IUE can play in understanding time dependent stellar activity and that conducting such a campaign without IUE is a foolish venture. IUE observations provide wider coverage of UV variability due to flaring and rotational modulation than possible with any other UV instrument and will form the overall observational framework of chromospheric and transition region behavior against which the coronal data from other instruments will be analyzed. The multiwavelength spectroscopy will be used to investigate the coronal and TR emission measure distribution and definitively model the atmospheric structure and energy balance of this prototypical RS CVn system.|Y

RVKEB|Detailed Phase Coverage of Atmospheric Shocks in V Vul and AC Her|Edward W.|Brugel|Colorado - CASA|We propose to obtain detailed observations of the Mg II emission variability for two RV Tauri stars. These observations will be made using the LWP camera in low dispersion for both stars, plus a limited number of high dispersion LWP observations at specific phases. These high dispersion spectra are extremely important for disentangling the Mg II emission from atmospheric absorption and for ascertaining if there are any effects due to extended outer atmospheric and/or circumstellar absorption. The two objects - V Vul and AC Her - were chosen as the best candidates for detailed study based upon the results of our tenth year RV Tauri Mg II monitoring (and feasibility) program. Existing observations for AC Her cover only 65% of one cycle at intervals of ~ 0.2 in phase; similar insufficient data exist for V Vul. The important "rise in the shock" and "peak excitation" phases were not observed for either object. In order to fulfill the extremely important criteria of obtaining good detailed (Delta phi, 0.1) phase coverage during a single cycle, we have restricted this investigation to only two objects.  The variability of Mg II emission will be monitored, as well as the atmospheric temperature via uv metallic-line absorption (Fe II and Mn II). Simultaneous optical spectroscopy will be obtained with the UW 36" and the UCB 24" telescopes. When combined, the uv and optical data provide sufficient information to determine the temperature, gravity, and metallicity at each phase point, in addition to determining the phase dependent onset and decline of Mg II and Hydrogen Balmer line emission.  By observing Mg II throughout the cycle it should be possible to determine the shockluminosity and duration, and the density in the upper atmosphere of these RV Tau stars. These data also provide a mechanism for probing the radiative cooling in post-shock regions of the atmosphere and ultimately the mass loss process. Theoretical model calculations (Bowen 1987) indicate that pulsation is an underlying cause of enhanced mass loss in the region of the H-R diagram occupied by pulsationally unstable stars.  To summarize, the goals of this proposal are to (1) monitor the atmospheric temperature at various phases via the uv metallic absorption lines; (2) investigate the propagation of atmospheric shocks and induced mass loss from the outer atmosphere of RV Tau stars through monitoring the Mg II emission versus phase; (3) combine uv and optical data to provide a spectroscopically unambiguous determination of the temperature, gravity and metallicity during a single cycle; (4) use high dispersion data (when possible) to disentangle the Mg II shock emission from atmospheric absorption: and (5) to compare the results for two distinct subclasses of RV Tauri stars.|Y
RVLEB|Miras and RV Tauri Stars: Shock Waves and Pulsation-Related Mass Loss|Edward W.|Brugel|Colorado - CASA|We propose tocombine high resolution IUE observations with good phase coverage and coordinated ground-based observations of Miras and RV Tauri stars with new theoretical calculations incorporating hydrodynamic atmospheric models including detailed, non-LTE radiative transfer to constrain key stellar and atmospheric parameters. These two classes of pulsating variable stars have low surface gravities; high mass flux, dusty winds; and shock waves that develop deep in the atmosphere. The proposed high dispersion observations will provide clues to the density structure in the part of the atmosphere where dust forms and drives the final wind, and therefore help constrain those theoretically most uncertain parameters: dust characteristics and pulsation amplitude. In addition to the radiative transfer studies of shocked stellar atmospheres, the proposed observations will also address the origin of the SiO maser; whether it is triggered by the passage of the shock, or whether it is possibly due to a planetary companion interacting with the stellar wind.|Y

When combined with astrometric orbits, we will derive key information on the masses and distances of these systems.|Y

RYNBW|The Role of Pulsational Shock Waves in the R CrB Behavior of RY Sgr|Barbara A.|Whitney|Harvard CFA - SAO|The physical processes responsible for the formation of dust clouds which cause the large declines in brightness of the R CrB stars are still mysterious. In particular, it is not understood how mass loss occurs from these stars, how and where the dust forms, and what is the nature of the chromospheric emission seen during declines. Insights into the role that stellar pulsations play in these processes can be gained by observing the Mg II resonance lines in RY Sgr. This star is the ideal candidate because it is bright, has a regular pulsational period, and has large radial velocity variations.  We propose to obtain high signal-to-noise, high dispersion LWP spectra coveting a complete pulsation cycle of the R CrB star, RY Sgr. These IUE spectra along with simultaneous ground-based spectra will be used to study die progression of shocks through the outer atmosphere of RY Sgr, and to look for evidence of winds. This will aid in modelling atmospheres of these pulsating stars with the goal of answering the question of where dust is formed.|Y
RYRGP|A Study of the Circumstellar Material in RY Per|Geraldine J.|Peters|USC|High dispersion IUE observations are proposed of the Algol binary RY Per (B3-5V + F0III, P=6.86 days) over one cycle in its orbit to investigate the effect of the cross-section and temperature of the primary on the mass transfer and mass loss in the system. This system contains an early B primary (with a weak wind) that presents a large enough cross-section to impede the flow of the gas stream. According to theoretical expectations, the gas stream in this system should be narrow, highly focused, and will strike the primary obliquely instead of feeding an accretion disk. The presence of very weak H-alpha emission in the system supports this suggestion. We will look for evidence of a hot spot at the predicted site of gas stream impact and a high temperature plasma on the trailing side of the binary and between the stars that may be generated from the gas stream collision and/or subsequent splash. Emission lines from highly ionized species have been seen in this system during total eclipse, and this project will reveal the location, geometry, and extent of the high temperature region that produces this emission. The circumstellar material in RY Per will be compared with that in two similar systems (Z Vul and FV Sco) and AU Mon and CX Dra, which also contain early B primaries but have larger separations. Any mass loss at phase 0.5 or elsewhere will be compared with the inferred rate of mass transfer and with that observed in AU Mon and other systems. Finally we study the apparent carbon depletion and nitrogen enhancement, which we have found in other Algols with A-F secondaries.|Y

SAITS|Outer-Planet Surorae|Thomas E.|Skinner|Colorado|Aurorae on Jupiter are believed to be internally driven, produced by a magnetospheric coupling between the upper atmosphere and the Io torus, while the Saturnian aurorae are believed to be driven by the solar wind. These generally held views have been inferred from the intensity of the auroral emissions compared to estimates of the power that might be extracted by Jupiter and Saturn from the solar wind to drive the emissions. But these ideas have not been tested directly. A series of observations of Jupiter and Saturn are requested on a target of opportunity basis in order to study the interaction between the solar wind and magnetospheres of the giant planets. Solar wind disturbances will be monitored using spacecraft in the inner solar system that are currently operational. The arrival time of a disturbance at Jupiter or Saturn can be predicted on the basis of corotation and convection delays. Monitoring of auroral emissions during periods of unusually large solar wind disturbance (occurring once or twice per year) will provide significant new information on auroral production mechanisms at Jupiter and Saturn that cannot be obtained in any other way.|Y
SAJCW|Augmentation of IUE Ultraviolet Spectral Atlas|Chi-Chao|Wu|CSC|The first edition of the IUE Ultraviolet Spectral Atlas was published in 1983 by Wu et al in printed and magnetic tape versions and it has been widely used by the astronomical community for research and teaching purposes. It was recognized then that numerous spectral type-luminosity class combinations were not available in the Atlas, but the authors decided that it was important to provide the Atlas to the community early. Now we are proposing a 3-year program to augment the Atlas (1) to provide as complete a coverage of the spectral type-luminosity class as possible and (2) to provide more than one star per spectral type-luminosity class combination to guard against variability and pecularity and to allow a finite range of temperature, gravity and metallicity in a given combination. Almost all the data in the 1983 Atlas are the high quality, high SIN trailed spectra, we propose to obtain trailed spectra or images with multiple exposures in the large aperture such that the data for the augmentation effort will have the same quality and SIN as the 1983 Atlas. Our primary goal is to collect the data and make them available to the community immediately (without claiming the 6-month proprietary right) and at the end of each year we will provide National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC) an annual incremental delivery of the data at an earliest possible date, so the data can be distributed to the general astronomical community. At the end of the 3rd year, our delivery to the NSSDC will contain all the data collected by this program combined with those from the 1983 Atlas and 50 stars from the archive.

SAMEG|Magnetic Activity of the Sun in Time|Edward F.|Guinan|Villanova|We request IUE observations of six single, solar-like stars which have been chosen as proxies for the Sun at ages ranging from ~70 Myr to ~9 Gyr. An important factor in their selection has been the availability of long term IUE observations in the IUE archives, and long term optical photometry. A primary aim of the proposal is to make full use of the archival material in conjunction with fresh IUE observations in order to identify the presence of magnetic activity cycles, in an attempt to understand the evolution of the Sun's magnetic activity cycle. In addition we shall obtain quantitative estimates of the line-emission and continuum UV flux of the Sun in time, using these stars as proxies. The UV flux of the young Sun played an important role in the evolution of the planetary atmospheres, and possibly also in the origin and evolution of life on Earth. We have recently analyzed IUE and photometric observations of HD 129333, the youngest of the target stars. There is evidence of an activity cycle of about 7-8 years duration. We shall try to coordinate IUE observations of this star with ROSAT during the all-sky X-ray survey, and also with VLA observations. We have been granted ROSAT pointed time for HD 129333, with the possible addition of Pi UMa and ? Hyi. . HD 44694 is the closest in spectral characteristics to the Sun of any star known, and is presumably similar in age. It has not yet been observed with IUE. The UV observations of this "solar twin" will be important in determining the extent to which the Sun may be considered a normal star.|Y
SAMJC|Simultaneous IUE and ROSAT Observations of Jupiter's Aurora|John T.|Clarke|Michigan|This proposal is for IUE time to observe Jupiter's bright aurora simultaneous with accepted ROSAT guest observer time on 15 April 1991. The ROSAT observations are expected to resolve the controversy about whether the soft X-rays from Jupiter's aurora (discovered by the Einstein Observatory) are produced by electron brehmsstrablung or by K-shell lines of S and 0 ions precipitating from the lo torus by spectrally resolving any line emission(s). The IUE observations play an important role in this experiment, and are needed to relate the brightness of Jupiter's aurora to other observed aurora over the past decade. The ROSAT mission offers a unique opportunity to simultaneously observe Jupiter's aurora in the FUV, soft X-ray, near and mid-IR, and radiation belt radio emissions. As a second priority, we are requesting IUE time to observe Jupiter's aurora during the ROSAT all-sky survey with the Wide Field Camera (WFC). These observations could provide information on the relative variability of Jupiter's aurora in the FUV and soft X-ray over a period of 4-5 days.|Y

SARFF|Activity in Pop II Stars|Francis C.|Fekel|Tennessee State University - CEIS|Chromospheric and transition region activity has been shown to depend primarily on rotation in late-type stars. Although the role of other factors such as evolutionary state, effective temperature, and radius has previously been considered, the role of metallicity has not. We propose to observe 4 binary pop II systems that range in metallicity from [M/H] = -1.1 to -2.3. We will compare and contrast the emission fluxes with those of pop I stars and examine whether transition region and chromospheric fluxes behave similarly. The results also will be examined in the context of optical and xray observations of the same systems.|Y
SARTL|Equinoctial Observations of Saturnian Aurorae and Seasonal Effects|Timothy A.|Livengood|NASA/GSFC|The equinoctial view of Saturn which will be presented in 1995 provides a rare opportunity (once every ~14.7 years) to investigate the aurorae and seasonality of Saturn. This is only the second time that the IUE spacecraft has been able to simultaneously study stratospheric processes in both hemispheres, and is the first chance to observe both hemispheres since the Voyager spacecraft flyby. This program will investigate the magnetic-longitude dependence of the aurorae at both poles and determine whether they exhibit a local-time-independent morphology similar to Jupiter's aurorae. Data will be compared with the wellstudied aurora of Jupiter. Extensive spectroscopy of Saturn's UV albedo will be acquired, probing abundances of trace molecular species in the stratosphere. Molecular abundances and abundance ratios determined from this work will constrain models of the ring-enhanced seasonal variability of Saturn's photochemistry.|Y

SBHFF|Mass Ratios of Composite Binaries|Francis C.|Fekel|Vanderbilt University|A number of single-lined binaries consist of a late-type giant and a B or A star secondary whose presence is indicated by a-composite spectral type, Accurate velocity measurements of the early-type component in such a system is very difficult at optical wavelengths because of the strong flux and numerous lines of the late-type primary. In the ultraviolet between 2400 and 3200A it is possible to determine the relative velocities of both components. A mass ratio can be determined which combined with the velocity curve of the late-type star and its inclination will give the individual masses. If the inclination is unknown, a main sequence mass for the early-type star can be reliably estimated from its spectral type, obtained from low-dispersion ultraviolet spectra. These masses will permit improved comparisons with evolutionary theory for single stars.|Y
SBHFW|Continuing High-Resolution Ultraviolet Observations of Hot B Subdwarfs|Francois|Wesemael|Montreal|The aim of this project is to obtain high-dispersion ultraviolet observations of two hot B subdwarfs. Our scientific objectives are (i) to further our knowledge of the chemical abundance patterns in the hot B subdwarfs and to compare them with those observed in the OB and 0 subdwarfs, and (ii) to promote critical comparisons of the observed element over- and underabundances with theoretical predictions based on theories of settling and of radiative element support in the envelopes and atmospheres of subdwarfs.|Y
SBITA|Winds in Supergiant Binaries|Thomas B.|Ake|CSC|We propose to perform a comparative study of wind structures and shock fronts in G-type supergiant binaries by observing with IUE three short-period systems with B type secondaries at various orbital positions. By using the hot stars as probes, the spatial distribution of the outer winds of the primaries and the shock waves that form in the supersonic flow passing the secondaries can be studied. Preliminary investigations of the systems we have chosen, Mu Per, A Car and 22 Vul, are that each primary exhibits different wind characteristics. For Mu Per, the GO Ib star has a moderate velocity wind that seems to be tightly concentrated to the star; A Car (G6 II) has low velocity material surrounding the entire system; 22 Vul (G3Ib-II) has a large, high velocity cloud in which both components are embedded. As shock fronts are dependent upon the physical conditions of the mass flow, the differences in wind structures in these systems should help determine model sensitive parameters. High dispersion SWP images are needed to study lines of C IV, Si IV and N V formed in the high temperature regions, while LWP observations of Mg II and Fe II will characterize the current state of the cooler wind. These systems have short enough periods that orbital coverage can be obtained in one IUE observing cycle. In all they support our view that there is a continuum of binary types from strongly interacting systems such as SX Cas, through close Zeta Aur objects like 22 Vul, to the further separated components of the classical Zeta Aur systems.|Y
SBJCG|Blue Stragglers in Open Clusters|Catharine D.|Garmany|Colorado - CASA|Blue stragglers, identified as stars in clusters which are still along the main sequence but brighter than the turnoff, have had numerous theories proposed to explain them, but no clear consensus has emerged. Although some explanations seem to have been ruled out (they are post main-sequence stars; they represent a later wave of star formation in the cluster) it is not clear whether blue stragglers have undergone binary mass transfer, are the end product of coalesced stars, or have undergone core mixing, perhaps by internal magnetic fields, or even a combination of these processes. We propose to approach the problem of stragglers in intermediate-age open clusters by observing both blue stragglers and normal main sequence stars in the same cluster, using the low dispersion mode of IUE. We want to look first for direct evidence of hot, subluminous companions in order to address the question of binary mass exchange. Second, we will compare the stragglers with the normal stars and with theoretical models to derive their physical parameters. Third, we will intercompare the main sequence stars in an effort to identify straggler precursors through any bi-modality in hot companions, chemical differences or rotation.|Y
SBKMP|Superionized Winds in Semidetached Binaries|Mirek J.|Plavec|UCLA|Emission lines of superionized plasmas exist in semidetached binaries with nondegenerate components (Algols and W Serpentis stars), and there is little doubt that they signal the presence of a stellar wind. However, the component stars are neither hot nor luminous enough to drive the wind or to photoionize it. The wind is therefore different from the winds known to exist in hot luminous stars or in cool stars with active chromospheres. The wind is also different from the wind in cataclysmic binaries, since the accretion disk is also neither hot nor luminous enough.  In order to investigate the specific conditions existing in the semidetached systems, I have observed 19 different systems, and for 12 of them data are sufficiently accurate to permit statistical comparisons. Dependence on the effective temperature of the accreting star, on the degree of CNO processing, and on the rate of mass transfer is found, while other potential parameters (such as the spin velocity of the gainer) must also be considered. In order to make theoretical modeling possible, I propose to strengthen the survey by adding several gainers with spectral type A and at least two gainers with spectral type earlier than B5. Observations in totality re needed for the detection of the emission lines.  Observations in full light are also needed in order to obtain correct spectral types of the gainers, since optical observations tend to make them systematically later. So far, no gainer has been found to be later than A0; if this result is confirmed by a broader sample, this will have important implications for theoretical modeling of the evolution of the Algols.|Y
SBLKC|Minkowski's Object: A Starburst Triggered by a Radio Jet|K. C.|Chambers|STScI|Makowski's Object is the best low redshift example of a rare phenomena - a starburst triggered by a radio jet (van Brengel etal., 1985, Brodie etal., 1985). Recent observations of very high redshift radio galaxies indicate that this phenomena may be a general property of powerful radio galaxies at large lookback times (Chambers etal. 1987a, 1987b, McCarthy etal. 1987). The specific character of the starburst in Minkowski's Objects may help provide a due to the remarkable morphologies and spectral energy distributions of the most distant and powerful radio galaxies. IUE observations of Minkowski's Object will provide a direct comparison of the rest frame ultraviolet spectrum of this nearby jet triggered starburst with that of the rest frame ultraviolet spectra of the high redshift radio galaxies observed from the ground. (Previous IUE observations were taken at a position approximately 2 arcminutes away from Minkowski's object.) In this observing request we propose to observe Minkowski's object twice for two and one half shifts in collaboration with our European counterparts. One half shift will be used for the setup and blind offset, and then we will integrate for two full shifts. The spectra will be co-added to improve the signal to noise ratio.|Y
SBMNE|Red Giant Binaries In Clusters|Nancy Remage|Evans|Canada|A recent study by Mermilliod and Mayor has provided extensive CORAVEL radial velocity data for red giants in open clusters. The primary aim the program is to determine the the distribution of orbital periods, separations, eccentricities and mass ratios in these clusters. Mermilliod and Mayor have found 20 spectroscopic binaries or suspected spectroscopic binaries on the basis of orbits, orbital motion, or colors which are too blue among 5 Hyades-age clusters, NGC 2447, NGC 2539, Praesepe, NGC 6633, and NGC 6940. The distribution of the binary parameters in these clusters provides information about the formation of binary systems in clusters, the intrinsic width of cluster main sequences, the evolution of binary systems (circularization of orbits), and the dynamical evolution of clusters.  The purpose of this proposal is to obtain IUE low dispersion observations of the binary stars in these clusters. From the ultraviolet spectra we will be able to determine the spectral types of the companions more accurately than is possible from the composite colors from the ground. For these "temperature resolved" systems, we can infer temperatures and ultraviolet magnitudes for the companions, leading to masses from evolutionary tracks. In this way, we will obtain an accurate distribution of mass ratios (compared with the red giant masses of 2.3 M(sun)). The preliminary estimates of the temperatures of the companions indicate that we should be able to observe the companions of 14 of the binaries in the Mermilliod-Mayor study.  As a lower priority project (in case of high radiation), we will take low dispersion LWP spectra of five giants in Praesepe. This is to see whether they share with the Hyades giants a range in chromospheric activity (Mg II emission), despite similar ages, masses, and projected rotation velocities. The new data can be compared with archival spectra to see whether there are any changes in emission line strength in the last five years.|Y
SBPJM|Emission Lines from the Eridanus Superbubble|Jayant N.|Murthy|Johns Hopkins University|We propose to obtain both SWP and LWP spectra of two locations in the Eridanus superbubble at which intense emission from C III (977 A) and O VI (1035 A) were observed using the Voyager spacecraft. Based on those detections, and using appropriate shock models, we expect to see significant levels of emission in the IUE spectral range. We will then use the observed ratios and levels of emission in the different lines to constrain our models of the interior shocks and abundances. These will be the first observations of emission from a superbubble and will yield critical insights into the structure and dynamics of these integral parts of the interstellar medium.|Y

SCBMA|Ultraviolet Cometary Spectrophotometry|Michael F.|A'Hearn|Maryland|We propose to investigate the composition of and physical processes in cometary atmospheres. These observations are contingent on the appearance of a suitably bright comet during the time that IUE is active. Although many other things can be learned from the data, we propose to investigate specifically the following four problems. We will use profiles of the OH bands at a variety of heliocentric radial velocities to calibrate a program of photometry which we have submitted to the NASA Lear Jet program. This IUE-Lear Jet program will enable us to determine OH production rates (for which the IUE entrance aperture is too small) for a variety of comets to be compared with production rates of other species measured from the ground. We propose also to investigate the abundance of sulphur in comets. This will involve the determination of the scale length of the CS radical so that data now available on CS fluxes can be converted to production rates and also the investigation of the atomic lines that have been tentatively identified as sulphur. We also propose to investigate the C2 radical. We propose to test theoretical calculations of the expected strength of the C2 Fox-Herzberg bands and we propose to search for the Mulliken bands of the anomalously missing singlet states of C2. Finally we propose to obtain spectra during any outbursts of Comet P/TuttleGiacobini-Kresak which might occur during the lifetime of IUE. Spectra during these outbursts may finally enable us to understand the triggering mechanism of the outbursts.|Y

A large number of problems will be addressed by these data relating to the composition of the nucleus, the dynamics of the gas outflow and the photochemistry of the neutral and ionized gas in the coma. Since a comet is an extended, time-varying source, the observing program must be carefully planned. The outline of such a program is presented based on previous ultraviolet observations of comets and on models developed to interpret the earlier UV data.|Y

SCGJH|Ultraviolet Absorption Studies Toward Comet Comae|Jan Michael|Hollis|NASA/GSFC|We propose unique observations of cometary comae seen against hot earlytype stars which will allow accurately determined column densities of observed cometary species via simple absorption experiments. Such observations may produce the first unambiguous detection of H20 in cometary comae and allow the determination of population levels in this and other species within the 11JE instrumentation bandpass. Moreover, the experiment we propose may also allow the first detection and study of UV continuum changes due to the effects of dust in cometary comae; this would allow comparisons to be made between dust properties of comets and the interstellar medium. This program would also be a complementary one with respect to UV emission features commonly observed in comets with the IUE and would add another dimension to IUE cometary observations. The IUE is the first such instrument suitable for these observations and could pioneer this research area, allowing valuable experience to be gained in such experiments prior to the advent of ST's HRS and the apparition of Comet Halley.|Y

SCLTA|S Stars as Cooler Analogs to BA II Stars-The Question of Binarity|Thomas|Ake|STScI|Stars of type MS, S, and C are those descendents of K and M giants which show evidence of CNO processing and enrichment in s-process elements. While most of these are thought to be thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, recent abundance determinations indicate that the M-MS-S-SC-C sequence may not be a simple evolutionary one, and that the peculiar red giants are a heterogeneous mixture of objects with different evolutionary histories. One subgroup of these, the objects possessing no technetium, appear to be the cooler analogs to Ba II stars and thus owe their spectral peculiarity to a prior mass-transfer event rather than actively mixing new s-process material to their surface. In this scenario, the current peculiar star was contaminated by a secondary when it was on the AGB, and that component is now a white dwarf. Three Tc-deficient MS and S stars are already known to have hot companions, two of which exhibit high-temperature UV emission lines indicating the components are close enough for mass transfer to have occurred. Recent radial-velocity studies that most S stars may be binaries has strengthened the Ba II-S star connection. We propose to observe 4 more Tc-deficient MS and S stars, one of which has been classified both as a Ba II star and S star by different observers and has just been found to be a spectroscopic binary.|Y

Low resolution spectra will enable us to investigate the relationship between the production of carbon-containing species and the production of H2O, the spatial distribution of ions, and the differences between dusty and gassy comets.  We also propose to study three predictable objects. We will take advantage of the close approach to Earth by comet P/Honda-Mrkos-Pajdusakova to search for molecules confined near the nucleus like S, We will attempt to confirm the sudden changes in comet P/Encke near 0.8 AU preperihelion that have been inferred from disparate sets of data. We will also attempt to confirm the tentative measurement of outflow velocity in this comet based on the Greenstein effect. Finally, we will search for emission by OH near Ceres as would be expected if much of it is covered with frost as suggested by Lebofsky and others.|Y
SCMPF|Observations of Comets with the IUE|Paul D.|Feldman|Johns Hopkins University|The IUE spectrographs will be used to obtain ultraviolet spectra of any suitable comet that may appear, as a target-of-opportunity, in the year beginning I June 1990. The focus of this year's program, which will enter into its thirteenth consecutive year, is on the controlling effect of the variation of solar extreme ultraviolet radiation during the 11-year solar activity cycle on the photochemistry of the neutral and ionized gas in the cometary coma. In addition, it is expected that during this year simultaneous observations of a target-of-opportunity comet by both IUE and the Hubble Space Telescope may be possible. IUE will also be used to observe two interesting periodic comets, Encke and Honda-Mrkos-Pajdusakova.|Y
SCNMA|IUE Observations of Comets and Related Bodies|Michael F.|A'Hearn|U Maryland|We propose to observe comets P/Faye and P/Hartley 2 and asteroid 1566 Icarus. Comet P/Hartley 2 is the comet to be observed under an approved HST program for spectroscopy of periodic comets. We plan to observe it With IUE during the same period that it is observed with HST in order to relate our extensive database of IUE observations to the data to be obtained from HST. Comet P/Faye will be the target of an intensive ground-based observing, program to derive nuclear properties. The IUE observations will be aimed at determining the production rate of the dominant gaseous species at the time of our ground-based observations in order to estimate the fraction of the surface which is active.  The asteroid 1566 Icarus is one of several which are considered likely candidates to be extinct cometary nuclei. Analysis of the orbit by Yeomans has shown that inclusion of a non-gravitational force similar to that used for periodic comets significantly improves the quality of the fit to the orbit. We propose to search for the outgassing that might produce this non-gravitational force.  We also propose to observe any newly discovered bright comets with the specific scientific goals to be determined depending on the brightness, the geocentric distance, the radial velocity, variability, and other properties of the comet. These goals may include studies of the Swings and Greenstein effects of OH, chemical variations as a function of rotational phase of the nucleus, expansion of our statistically small simple of comets for which the abundance of CO has been determined, spatial mapping of CS and CO2+, searches for new chemical species, and so on.|Y
SCNPF|Observations of Comets with IUE|Paul D.|Feldman|Johns Hopkins University|We propose to obtain deep IUE images in the low-dispersion mode for the LWP and SWP cameras of the peculiar galaxy NGC 1808. This galaxy has been classified as one of the few to show both Seyfert and starburst characteristics. Our own analysis of the IRAS, IUE and CCD imagery data favor the starburst model. However, the current IUE images of NGC 1808 available in the archives, previously taken by us, are underexposed and little information can be extracted from them. We propose to do a comparative study of the well-exposed spectrum of NGC 1808 with the archetype Seyfert and starburst galaxies already observed with IUE. We emphasize that the characterization of the Seyfert and starburst activity have not been very well documented or studied in the ultraviolet wavelengths and this proposal is a small step toward a better understanding of both important phenomena.|Y
SCORS|Intersystem C II Lines as Shock Diagnositics in Stellar Chromospheres|Robert E.|Stencel|Colorado - CASA|The mid-UV intersystem lines of C II near 2325A have been demonstrated to provide a useful diagnostic for stellar chromospheres, through density sensitive variations of the multiplet line ratios. Recent HST/GHRS observations of the K5 III star Alpha Tau surprised investigators in revealing unexpectedly large line widths of near 25 km/sec. These widths are thought to arise from either high levels of turbulence or some other new line broadening mechanism. If the turbulence arises from stochastic acoustic waves, as theorized by Cuntz and others, variations in the C II] line strengths and density-sensitive line ratios are anticipated. We propose to survey a sample of non-coronal giant and supergiant stars to look for this variation on timescales of days and months, and in combination with the limited archival data, years.|Y
SCOSS|UV Spectra of the "Super-Cycle" Star: HD 10780|Steven H.|Saar|Harvard CFA - SAO|HD 10780 is a moderately active K0 dwarf star with the largest known dynamo cycle amplitude (as seen in the Ca II S index) of any known dwarf. Its Ca II cycle amplitude is almost a factor of three higher than the highest seen among normal dwarfs. In 1989, HD 10780 underwent an extraordinary increase in activity, Delta S/S ~ 40%, from its cycle minimum. There are only three previous IUE observations, all LWP, and all of these spectra were taken before the recent "cycle outburst". The stars' activity levels appear to have peaked, and may now be starting a steep decline. We propose an extensive campaign to study the star in detail, combining new IUE SWP and LWP observation, plus optical spectroscopy, magnetic field and ROSAT X-ray measurements to, determine (1) the activity characteristics of this unusual star near its cycle maximum; and (2) any unusual characteristics of the star which may explain its extraordinary behavior. Results will further understanding of stellar activity, dynamos, and intermediate term variability.|Y

SDHFW|Continuing Low-Resolution Ultraviolet Observations of Hot B Subdwarfs|Francois|Wesemael|Montreal|The aim of this project is to obtain ultraviolet energy distributions for a sample of newly-discovered hot B subdwarfs. This is part of a comprehensive program aimed at better understanding the properties and evolutionary status of these stars. The ultraviolet data will be combined with photometric and spectrophotometric optical data and with Voyager observations and these will be analyzed with the help of detailed model atmosphere calculations available in Montreal. Ultraviolet spectrophotometry provides a sensitive discriminant of the effective temperature in these relatively hot stars. With reliable determinations of the temperature, analyses of the optical data will yield improved values of the gravity and the He/H ratio in these stars. Data obtained in the course of this program will be instrumental for our understanding of the physical processes (convection, diffusion, radiative forces) that are at work in the atmospheres and envelopes of sdB stars.|Y
SDIGW|Ultraviolet Spectra of Subluminous Objects Found in the Kisoschmidt Survey|Gary A.|Wegner|Dartmouth University|The stars being proposed for investigation are the brightest of a new sample of ultraviolet excess objects that were originally found and published in the Kiso Schmidt camera survey and that now have visual wavelength spectral types from observations at the McGraw-Hill Observatory. There is a total of 20 proposed targets in three broad classes of subluminous stars, including hot white dwarfs, subdwarfs, and emission line objects, which are among the bluest and most peculiar of the nearly 200 stars with available spectral classes. It is desired to combine low resolution IUE ultraviolet spectra with visual data to further analyze the natures and atmospheric compositions of these peculiar subluminous stars.|Y
SDIRB|IUE Observations of Subdwarfs and RR Lyrae Stars|Roger A.|Bell|Maryland|A series of observations will be carried out for a number of subdwarf stars and an RR Lyrae variable. Four of the subdwarfs are Oke and Gunn standards and their fluxes in the wavelength region 3000 < lambda < 12000 A have been studied intensively. The IUE fluxes will give a test of model atmosphere theory for cool stars and will also test the calibration of the IUE and how well IUE data fits ground based data in the overlap region. A number of other subdwarfs, with metal abundances in the range 2 < [M/H] < -0.5, will also be studied. This work is partly a test of model atmosphere theory. However, the observations are also needed to aid in the interpretation of the observations of integrated light of globular clusters. If these observations are corrected for the light from horizontal branch stars, they will give information on cluster ages. The observations of RR Lyrae stars are needed both as a test of the model atmospheres for horizontal branch stars and as a check on the pulsational properties of these stars.|Y
SDITS|Lyman Alpha Spectra of Three Standard Candles|Theodore|Simon|Hawaii|Hot white dwarf or subdwarf companions have been discovered in IUE observations of three binary stars, AY Ceti, 29 Draconis, and HD 185510. The primary components of the binaries are spotted, chromosphericallyactive, G - K type giants. The white dwarf secondary stars of AY Cet and 29 Dra have been used as "standard candles" to derive the distances, dimensions, orbital inclinations, and other parameters of these binaries. The secondary of HD 185510 has been identified as a subdwarf, principally an account of the absorption lines in its UV spectrum, but a higher surface gravity is derived by fitting the profile of Lyman-alpha to hydrogen line profiles from model atmospheres.  We are proposing to obtain new, small-aperture spectra of the Lymanalpha lines of these three stars. The observations will remove the most serious defects in existing large-aperture spectra by reducing the contamination from geocoronal emission and properly exposing the central region of the line profile. The higher quality of these spectra will allow us to derive effective temperatures and surface gravities of the secondary stars with much reduced errors, especially for the secondary star of HD 185510, as well as to refine the values of the masses, radii, and other parameters of the binary stars. By combining these UV results with new visual light curves, which can be modeled for starspots, and new radial velocity curves and orbital solutions, we hope to gain a better understanding of the enhanced chromospheric activity levels of these stars.|Y

SDJJL|Very Hot Subdwarfs|James W.|Liebert|Arizona|We propose to obtain high and low resolution IUE images of a select group of very hot subdwarfs culled from the Palomar Green Survey. These stars belong to a newly-recognized class of subdwarfs which apparently overlap in temperature and luminosity with the central stars of planetary nebulae, yet have apparently lost any nebular ejecta. IUE energy distributions and the detection of metallic features are essential in determining accurate temperatures, luminosities and abundances, from which we might derive the the space density and mass distributions of these objects. We hope to discover whether they have outflowing winds or even residual circumstellar gas, and whether such unusual objects are binaries.|Y
SDJTS|Eclipse Observations of HD 185510|Theodore|Simon|NASA/GSFC|HD 185510 is a 20.7-day binary star consisting of a spotted K0 III/IV primary and a hot B subdwarf secondary. The primary is an active chromosphere star and Is often included in the RS CVn class of active binaries; the sdB secondary was a serendipitous discovery made with IUE. At visual wavelengths there is hardly a trace of the secondary, except at the shortest wavelengths, and for this reason HD 185510 attracted little attention until it was recognized as an active chromosphere star. Recently, as a result of extensive photometry carried out at the SAAO, HD 185510 was found to undergo eclipses in the U-band. We have obtained IUE observations of HD 185510 which confirm that the UV eclipse of the sdB star is total. In addition, we have obtained an isolated spectrum of HD 185510 that shows dramatic atmospheric eclipse effects as the hot star passes behind the extended chromosphere and transition region of the K star.  HD 188510 thus joins a very select pair of stars, FF Aqr and V471 Tau, in which a small hot secondary star can be used as a probe of the atmosphere of a late-type primary. However, HD 188510 has the distinction of being the system with the longest orbital period of the three, and therefore offers the best time and spatial resolution. In this proposal, therefore, we are requesting time to monitor HD 185510 throughout both the ingress and egress phases of an eclipse. We will look for evidence of large scale structures (very tall loops or prominences) in the atmosphere of the K-type primary, similar to the loop structures that have been observed for both FF Aqr and V471 Tau.|Y
SDLJD|UV Spectroscopy of Very Hot sdO Stars|John S.|Drilling|Louisiana State|Observing time is requested to obtain low-resolution spectra of three very hot sdO stars with both the SWP and LWP cameras. These stars belong to a sample of 23 very hot sdO stars which is complete to V = 12.5. The observations will be used with existing IUE spectra of the other 20 stars to place them all in the HR diagram, and to determine the relative birthrates of pre-white dwarfs. They will also be used to obtain information about the metallic-line spectra of these stars and to look for evidence of mass loss.|Y
SDLTS|The Mass of the Subdwarf B Star in HD 185510|Theodore|Simon|Hawaii|HD 185510 is an RS CVn star with a K0 III-IV primary and an orbital period of 21 days. The secondary was discovered to be a hot subdwarf B star with IUE. The system also shows eclipses, secondary eclipse being total in the far UV. We propose here to determine the velocity amplitude of the secondary orbit, K2, from high dispersion ultraviolet spectroscopy with IUE. It will then be possible to make the first ever direct mass measurement for a true subdwarf B star.|Y

SDRJD|UV Spectroscopy of Very Hot SDO Stars|John S.|Drilling|Louisiana State University|Observing time is requested to obtain high- and low-resolution spectra of 7 very hot sdO stars. In the HR diagram, these stars occupy a region bounded by the nuclei of planetary nebulae, the hottest white dwarfs, and cooler sdO stars, and evidence has been found that the abundances of H, He, C, N, and Fe vary widely from star to star. We believe that detailed spectroscopic studies of these stars, both in the UV and in the visible, will be crucial to our understanding of evolution immediately preceding the white dwarf state.|Y

SEMSC|IUE Observations of Earth's Aurora|Supriya|Chakrabarti|UC Berleley|We propose to observe Earth's nightside aurora using the high-dispersion mode of the SWP camera. In the 1150-1950A wavelength range there are several interesting auroral emissions, and the background is negligible. Important features include the strong resonance triplet of atomic oxygen at 1304A, the forbidden doublet of O I 1356A, strong multiplets of atomic nitrogen at 1200 A, 1493 A, and 1744 A, and the N2 LBH bands from 1270-1950 A. The relative brightness of these emissions can be used to infer the energy of the precipitating auroral particles. With the high-dispersion spectral resolution of ~0.1-0.2A resolution it will be possible (for the first time in the ultraviolet) to separate the brighter resonance multiplets into their individual component lines. The relative intensities of the component lines will provide an independent estimate of the auroral particle energies. Large fluxes of moderately energetic (~30 eV) upflowing ions in the auroral regions may result in substantially broadened line profiles which could be detected in this experiment. Finally, if a proton aurora is also detected, it will be possible to resolve the concommitant H I Ly-alpha emission line at 1216A. Detection of this feature would provide an important point of comparison with previous high-resolution IUE observations of the Jovian aurora.|Y

SFOGC|UV Extinction Properties of Dust in a Region of Active Star Formation|Geoffrey C.|Clayton|Colorado - CASA|This proposal requests low-dispersion IUE observations of several dark cloud lines of sight (E(B - V) ~ 0.6 - 1.0) toward the GMC complex Cygnus X. IRAS images of the southwest region of this well known GMC reveals a shell structure superimposed on a field of hot young stars, known as the Cyg OB1 association. Saken et al. (1992) have found this well defined structure is visible in the ratio of the 60 microns to 100 microns Skyflux images. One scenario proposed by Saken et al. for seeing the cavity is that the small grains, the source of most of the 60 micron emission, have been destroyed by the strong stellar radiation field. The young galactic star clusters NGC 6913 (M 29), Berkeley 86 and IC 4996 make up the nuclei of the expansive star forming region of Cyg OB1 and are the best candidates to lie within the infrared structure. A study of the UV extinction properties of these stars would be sampling the dust responsible for the IRAS feature. This would enable us to test models of dust physical and chemical characteristics by fitting the curves to the models of Draine & Lee (1984) to see if this sightline shows evidence of an altered chemistry or size distribution. By choosing a few stars from each cluster to study, we can 1) determine the nature of the dust in different regions of the IRAS feature, and 2) compare the extinction curves of stars within the same cluster to determine the variability over small angles. No stars in the open galactic clusters NGC 6913, Berkeley 86 or IC 4996 have ever been observed with the IUE.|Y

SGEAU|Luminous Early-Type Stars|Anne B.|Underhill|NASA/GSFC|Study of the ultraviolet spectra of normal Ia and Ib supergiants of type B has Shown the the outer atmospheres, or mantles, of these stars are inhomogeneous, they are in outflow, and they are superheated by the deposition of non-radiative energy. Ground-based observations of the B-type supergiants has shown that the supergiants usually vary irregularly in light by a small amount, they frequently show emission in the H-alpha line which varies in its amount and line profile, and they Show a variable radial velocity. None of these variations has been Shown to be strictly periodic nor are any of them considered to be due to the regular evolution of a companion. The basic purpose of this proposal is to obtain information that can lead to an understanding of the basic cause of the variations as well as of the inhomogeneity, heating, and outflow of the mantle. The cause suggested is the presence of magnetic fields coming from or associated with dark spots on the disk Of the star.  Ground-based observation has shown that some supergiants are particularly variable and that some seem to be superluminous while others Show a variable polarization. The program stars have been chosen from this set of unusual objects for the purposes (1) of using low-resolution IUE spectra obtained over intervals of 2 to 6 days to determine if the variations are due to the rotation of an unevenly spotted disk, (2) of using the absolute energies from low-resolution IUE spectra together with absolute energies determined by other ultraviolet spectrophotometric observations and from the ground to determine the angular diameters and effective temperatures of the stars, and (3) Of Using high-dispersion IUE spectra to investigate inhomogeneities in the mantles of the target stars and to obtain an understanding of the peculiar spectral types given to some of the target stars. This last step will be aided by comparison with IUE spectra of normal Ia and Ib B-type supergiants obtained previously by the P.I.|Y
SGEBM|A Search for Companions to Non-Pulsating Yellow Supergiants|Barry F.|Madore|Toronto|We wish to investigate a sample of F and G supergiants whose photometric properties indicate that they are located inside or near the cepheid instability strip, while simultaneously showing no signs of variability. One possibility is that close, hot companions are responsible for suppressing the instabilities inherent in these supergiants as they evolve through the cepheid strip. Experience with IUE spectra of cepheids indicates that B stars are commonly found as companions and that low resolution spectra are quite adequate for their discovery and spectral classification.  For those stars without any detectable companion, we will still be able to analyse the chromospheric lines Mg II,2796, 2803 which give information on Mv, Onset of convection and mass loss and mechanisms of chromospheric beating (Stencel et al. 1980). All this may in turn contribute to the understanding of the suppression of the pulsation.|Y
SGFAU|Spotted Surfaces on Luminous Early-Type Stars|Anne B.|Underhill|NASA/GSFC|This proposal requests time during US2 in order to fill in and extend the observations made on program SGEAU of the changes in ultraviolet brightness of the continua of four B-type supergiants. The target stars are known irregular variables of small amplitude in the visible range; two of them are known to show polarization changes. More observing time is requested in order to determine more securely whether or not brightness variations occur in the ultraviolet and whether or not the brightness variations can be interpreted in terms of the rotation of an unevenly spotted disk.  Recent studies of the spectra of hot luminous stars (particularly as reported in the paper listed as IUE Publications, No. 13) have indicated that the surfaces of hot luminous stars may contain bipolar magnetic regions. The presence of such regions implies that the brightness temperature of the disk presented to an observer will change as the star rotates because each face of the star will not be similarly spotted. From studying the range of brightness change in the ultraviolet, it is hoped to obtain information that will either confirm or disprove the hypothesis that bipolar magnetic regions are present on the surfaces of O and B supergiants. Not enough observing time was assigned on program SGEAU to thoroughly determine the range in UV brightness which occurs for four stars. The first three sets of observations obtained on program SGEAU indicate that changes of the expected type are surely occurring for two of the stars. The results for the other two stars are not decisive either way.|Y
SGHJM|An Investigation of Broad-Line Regions of Seyfert 1 Galaxies|John S.|Mathis|Wisconsin|This is a proposal to test models of the broad-line-forming regions of Seyfert I galaxies by comparing theoretical predictions to observed line ratios. The L-alpha line strengths will be measured with IUE for a sample of Seyfert I galaxies for which Paschen alpha and Brackett gamma line strengths have been recently observed. These along with existing H-alpha and H-beta data can be used to distinguish between various models of the line-forming regions.|Y
SGIJN|Evolutionary Status of the Peculiar B3IA Supergiant HD 157038|Joy|Nichols-Bohlin|STScI|HD157038 is a peculiar hot supergiant whose spectrum shows evidence of having been contaminated by the products of interior nuclear reactions. In particular, visible region observations (e.g. Walborn 1976, Lennon and Dufton 1985) indicate that nitrogen enrichment of the stellar atmosphere appears to have occurred. This proposal aims to extend our observations of this star into the UV to confirm our previous findings, to investigate the current mass loss rate from this star, and to obtain an estimate of the stellar mass. We propose to observe this star continuously for one NASA and one ESA shift.|Y
SGMFB|Extranuclear Regions in Nearby Seyfert Galaxies|Frederick C.|Bruhweiler|Catholic University|The ultimate aim of this research is to understand how the unusual characteristics in the immediate galactic environments of AGNs are related to, or governed by, the activity in the nucleus.  There are few extranuclear environments of nearby AGNs that can be probed spatially with the IUE. We have, in the last few years, concentrated on obtaining IUE observations of the starburst knots and extended emission line region of NGC 1068 as well as the jetlike condensations of NGC 4151. We have identified from published ground-based imagery and examination of IUE archival data, two additional nearby Seyfert 2 galaxies, NGC 3982 and NGC 4388 that can also be successfully probed spatially with the IUE.  Building on our current study, we will: a.) Use our developed spatial mapping techniques to determine the distribution and ionization of the extended emitting gas in NGC 4388.  b.) Use the UV high ionization features of N V, C IV, and He II to determine if central source photoionization models can explain the fluxes and ionization of the extended emission in NGC 4388.  c.)Determine the UV luminosity and ages of the individual starburst knots in the annulus about the nucleus in NGC 3982, a Seyfert 2 with starburst activity that appears quite similar to that of NGC 1068.|Y

SGOGS|Anomalous A-Type Supergiants in the Magellanic Clouds|George|Sonneborn|NASA/GSFC|A group of A-type supergiants in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds have been suggested as candidates for helium-burning post-red supergiants on the basis of their optical spectral and photometric color anomalies, location on the HR diagram, and the existence of spectroscopically normal A supergiants in the same luminosity range. The spectral and color peculiarities can be best explained by enhanced helium (NHe/NH = 0.3 to 0.5) in the atmospheres of these supergiants. Their tentative post-red giant branch status makes these stars excellent candidates for the predecessors of the kind of star that became SN 1987A.  We propose to obtain the first UV spectra of a number of these anomalous A supergiants in the LMC and SMC. Measurement of their UV fluxes and spectroscopic characteristics will be used to determine their spectral energy distributions, and hence improved determinations of their bolometric luminosities, search for evidence of abundance enhancements of CNO processed material, and mass loss differences relative to normal A-type supergiants in the Clouds.|Y

SGPAK|Ultraviolet Spectra of Normal Spiral Galaxies|Anne L.|Kinney|STScI|We propose to observe the centers of a carefully defined sample of 8 of the brightest face-on, or nearly face-on, normal spiral galaxies with the IUE with the goal of typifying the UV spectra of these galaxies as a function of Hubble types Sa, Sb, Sc, Sd, and Irr. A thorough search of the IUE archives shows that while galaxies with various forms of activity have been extensively observed, the centers of only 13 normal spiral galaxies have observed (5 by us) and there has been no systematic analysis of their overall properties.  The spectra we will take will be combined with existing UV spectra and with optical spectra in a matched aperture size to produce template spectra which will span a wavelength range from 1200 to ~ 8000A. These template spectra will be used to address (1) the relation between normal spiral galaxies and active galaxies, (2) the relation between the centers of normal spiral galaxies and elliptical galaxies, (3) the differences in stellar populations present in the various Hubble types, (4) the contribution to the diffuse UV background from normal spiral galaxies, and (5) the classification of high redshift galaxies.|Y
SGPLD|Star-Burst Rings in S0 Galaxies|Linda L.|Dressel|Applied Research Corporation|True circumnuclear star-burst rings are rare. I have found three such rings in SO galaxies with powerful warm infrared sources. I have taken U, B, R, I, and Halpha images and long-slit spectra of the galaxies to help characterize the stellar populations in the bursts. The spectra and images directly indicate the number of late B and A stars, but the emission line strengths and IRAS data give only limited and indirect information about the more massive stars. SWP spectra are needed to determine the mix of O and early B main sequence stars, and possibly massive evolved stars, in the bursts. This mix will be determined chiefly from the absorption (and possibly emission) equivalent widths of the Si IV and C IV features at 1400 and 1550 A. The deduced numbers of O, B, and A main sequence stars can then be compared to models of continuous bursts with different initial mass functions, and to models of multiple bursts, to characterize this type of star-burst. Because these galaxies have radial velocities of about 4000 km/sec, it will be possible to observe Ly alpha in emission or absorption, and to make deductions about the internal extinction in the galaxies.|Y
SGRMC|Further Observations of the Core UV Upturn in Normal Spiral Galaxies|Michael T.|Carini|CSC - Astronomy Programs|Core UV upturns in normal spiral galaxies may provide a clear clue to galaxy evolution. If we can show that this phenomena is indicative of a past merger/ interaction event, then we have observational evidence to support the simulations and analytical argument that mergers and interactions are major effects in galaxy evolution and structure. We propose to observe 8 additional normal spiral galaxies bright enough to he detected with IUE, and to re-observe two galaxies with weak detections in the SWP camera. This will almost double the number of normal galaxies available to be searched for the presence of core UV upturns and to test the hypothesis that the core UV upturn is the observational signature of a recent merger/interaction event. Models of interacting systems can provide clues not only to the general galaxy evolution, but also to the value of the Hubble constant and the amount of galaxy dark matter.|Y

SHPOS|Variability in Gaseous Shells Around A Stars|Oswald H. W.|Siegmund|UC Berkeley|Many A stars have gaseous circumstellar shells. How these shells are formed and evolve is not known. The strength of lines from these shells is known to vary, but there are no quantitative data describing how much they vary, or even what typical column densities through the shells are. We demonstrate that variability can be detected in some archival spectra, and propose to use a combination of new and archival spectra to measure this variability in a sample of seven stars.|Y
SHPYC|The Supergiant Shell LMC3|You-Hua|Chu|U Illinois|LMC3 is the second largest supergiant shell in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Yet, it has had little study up till now. We have searched the IUE archives for targets within this shell that might yield information on its structure and dynamics. From the archival data, it seems likely that the near side of the shell approaches us at a relative velocity of 40 km/s, and that it is filled with hot gas. However, these results are currently based on low quality observations of targets in only one region of the shell. We want to confirm these results and to get a more detailed picture of the properties of the shell to allow a good comparison with theoretical models. To do this, we propose to acquire high quality spectra along two additional lines of sight.|Y
SHRYC|SNR Shocks in X-Ray Bright Superbubbles|You-Hua|Chu|U Illinois|Bright, diffuse X-ray emission has been detected in several Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) superbubbles. It is suggested that the bright X-ray emission is caused by interior supernova remnants (SNRs) shocking the dense superbubble shell walls. These SNR shocks cannot be easily detected in radio or optical wavelengths. We find they may be diagnosed by the interstellar absorption lines in the UV. Suitable IUE targets toward superbubbles are most likely members of the embedded OB association. If the SNR shock occurs on the near side of a superbubble, the spectrum of a target star behind the SNR shock would show extended blue wings in the high-ionization interstellar lines (C IV and Si IV) or a large blue-shift of the high-ionization lines relative to the low-ionization lines (S II, Si II, and C II*). This tentative conclusion is derived from five lines of sight in three X-ray bright superbubbles using archival IUE data. To strengthen this conclusion we propose high-dispersion, short-wavelength IUE observations for six targets in three X-ray bright superbubbles. The proposed observations allow us to confirm the SNR shocks so that we may further study their influence on the structure and evolution of superbubbles and to improve the SNR statistics.|Y

SIEHM|Study of the Torus of IO Using IUE|H. Warren|Moos|Johns Hopkins University|Two fourteen hour observations of the Io torus will be used to obtain a very sensitive detection of weak emissions. In addition to detecting new species, these measurements may provide new insight into the energizing mechanism(s) of the Io plasma torus. These measurements will also continue a series of monitoring observations which have been going on since the Voyager 1 encounter in order to determine long term changes in the properties of the torus.|Y

Observations to search for neutrals from Io penetrating into the plasma and to calibrate a new increased sensitivity observing technique against previous data sets will also be performed. The long term stability of the lo torus (since March 1979) is being determined as solar activity decreases.|Y
SIGHM|The Stability of the IO Torus|H. Warren|Moos|Johns Hopkins University|Two 16 hour periods (a Vilspa shift and a US1 shift back to back) plus a third US1 shift are requested in order to study changes in the hot plasma portion of the Io torus. Monitoring of the torus has been under way since the Voyager 1 encounter with Jupiter in March 1979. Recent observations show a significant decrease in emissions from the Io torus concurrent with the decrease in solar activity associated with the solar cycle; this change in the torus properties is in contradiction to present ideas in which the solar plasma is not expected to play a major role. The IUE spectra will be used to determine if this trend continues with decreasing solar activity and also to study variations in the charge state balance and electron temperature leading to information on changes in the confinement time. Neutral emissions in the vicinity of Io will provide direct estimates of the mass injection rate.|Y
SIHHM|The Stability and Longitudinal Homogeneity of the IO Torus|H. Warren|Moos|Johns Hopkins University|Two 16-hour periods (a Vilspa shift and a US1 shift back to back) plus a third US1 shift are requested in order to study changes in the hot plasma portion of the Io torus. Monitoring of the torus has been under way since the Voyager 1 encounter-with Jupiter in March 1979. Using a model developed and demonstrated during the previous year, the long-term stability of the torus will be measured. The electron density, ion mixing ratios and electron temperature can be determined from the IUE spectra. The drop in plasma density observed in 1983 July disappeared in the spring of 1984 but reappeared in 1984 September. A correlative study with Jovian auroral brightnesses will determine if sudden increases in plasma density and S II emission brightnesses are associated with unusually intense aurorae as suggested by one set of observations. The properties of the torus as a function of magnetic longitude will be determined by the IUE in coordination with ground-based visible studies.|Y
SIIHM|The Io Torus: Neutral Injection, Temperture Gradient and Stability|H. Warren|Moos|Johns Hopkins University|Two 16-hour periods (a Vilspa shift and a contiguous US1 shift plus a third US1shift are requested in order to 1. measure the neutral density in the vicinity of Io, 2. determine if the ionization balance is significantly different in the outer part of the Io torus and 3. study the long-term stability of the hot plasma portion of the torus. Both atomic oxygen and sulfur have strong resonance lines in this spectral region and should produce observable signals if certain models of the Io atmosphere are correct. Using a model developed and demonstrated previously, the ion mixing ratios and electron temperature can be determined from the IUE spectra as a function of elongation in order to determine if the ionization balance is dominated by the electron temperature or transport. The long term stability will be monitored to better determine the magnitude of the fluctuations in plasma density and electron temperature and the possible existence of long term trends. Monitoring of the torus has been under way since the Voyager 1 encounter, with Jupiter in March 1979. A correlative study with Jovian auroral brightnesses will determine if sudden increases in plasma density and S II emission brightnesses are associated with unusually intense aurorae as suggested by one set of observations. Ground-based studies will be performed in coordination with the IUE in order to tie the two types of data sets together in a better manner.|Y
SIJHM|IO and the IO Torus|H. Warren|Moos|Johns Hopkins University|Three 16-hour periods (a Vilspa shift and a contiguous US1 shift plus two additional US1 shifts are requested in order to 1. study the recently discovered interaction of the torus plasma wind with the atmosphere of Io, 2. search for evidence of molecules in the atmosphere of 10, 3. determine if the ionization balance is significantly different in the outer part of the Io torus and 4. study the long-term stability of the hot plasma portion of the torus. Recent IUE observations show that the strong lines of atomic oxygen and sulfur in this spectral region produce observable signals in the near vicinity of Io. Similar pointing techniques are expected to produce signatures from possible precursor molecular species such as SO and S02. For the torus, a model developed and demonstrated previously, will be used to determine the ion mixing ratios and electron temperatures of the IUE spectra as a function of elongation from Jupiter in order to determine if the ionization balance is in equilibrium with the electron temperature or controlled by transport. The long term stability will be monitored to better determine the magnitude of the fluctuations in plasma density and electron temperature and the possible existence of long term trends. (Monitoring of the torus has been under way since the Voyager 1 encounter with Jupiter in March 1979.) A correlative study with Jovian auroral brightnesses will determine if sudden increases in plasma density and S II emission brightnesses are associated with unusually intense aurorae as suggested by one set of observations.|Y
SIKHM|Io Atmosphere and Torus|H. Warren|Moos|Johns Hopkins University|Three 16 hour periods (a Vilspa shift and a contiguous US1 shift) are requested in order to study the recently discovered emissions of the atmosphere of Io and to compare the ionization balance in the outer part of the Io torus with that near the core (~6 RJ ). These spectra will also be used to study the long-term stability of the hot-plasma portion of the torus. Recent IUE observations show that strong lines of atomic oxygen and sulfur produce observable signals in the near vicinity of Io. However, a detailed analysis of the spectra shows that the simple picture of torus plasma exciting dilute neutrals in an extended exosphere is not complete. The total picture is as yet undetermined but could involve excitation of atoms at much higher density, heating of the ionosphere and auroral like processes, and dissociative excitation of sulfur dioxide by charged particles. The proposed observation of Io will determine if there is a difference between viewing the satellite in the plasma flow upstream direction versus the downstream direction. Spectra obtained at different elongations from Jupiter will be used with a model of the torus in order to determine if the ionization balance is in equilibrium with the electron temperature or is controlled by transport. Both these spectra and the ion emission lines which appear in the spectra of Io will also be used to determine the magnitude of the fluctuations in plasma density and the possible existence of long-term trends. (A long-term study of the stability of the torus has been under way since the Voyager I encounter with Jupiter in March 1979).

SIKJC|Detection of Io's Atmosphere by Particle Excitation in Eclipse|John|Clarke|University of Michigan|Much theoretical work has been performed on the density and extent of Io's atmosphere and ionosphere, largely due to their unique interaction with the Jovian magnetosphere and their potential for supplying much of the plasma detected in that magnetosphere. The material released from Io is observed in the torus in the visible and UV, and neutral clouds have been detected in the general vicinity of Io. Our knowledge of Io's atmosphere remains very poor, however, due to a lack of observations which could discriminate such basic questions as whether Io has a thick or thin atmosphere and how the impact of torus plasma alters the atmosphere. We now propose an observation which, if successful, would directly detect the excitation of Io's atmosphere by co-rotating Io torus plasma. Visible wavelength Voyager imaging detected weak auroral-like emissions from Io while in eclipse behind Jupiter, which may have been the low-energy tail of broad near-UV bands of SO excited by electron impact. We propose to observe Io in eclipse behind Jupiter with the LWP camera to detect the peak emission from these bands at 2600-2900 A. We can observe Io in shadow from 20 to 10 arc seecfrom the Jupiter limb with IUE, thus avoiding bright scattered light from the Jupiter disk and solar reflection from Io itself.  From the measured laboratory cross sections for these bands, and the Io atmosphere models of Kumar and Hunten, we expect that these bands may well be observed when Io is positioned in the hot torus plasma.|Y
SILWM|How Does Io Fuel the Plasma Torus|H. Warren|Moos|Johns Hopkins University|Three pairs of contiguous Vilspa-US1 shifts are requested to obtain observations of (i) Io at both eastern (E) and western (W) elongation and (ii) the eastern and western ansa of the Io plasma torus. These observations will chart new ground by studying a qualitatively new phenomenon: the excitation of a satellite's tenuous atmosphere when it is immersed in a flow of magnetically-trapped plasma. New observations are required in order to further characterize the nature of the neutral emissions of sulfur and oxygen from Io's atmosphere discovered with IUE in 1986 and found to exhibit an E-W brightness asymmetry  in 1987 and 1988. The origin of the E-W asymmetry will be identified by independent but near-simultaneous observations of both Io and the torus, which will permit deconvolution of the torus spatial brightness effects from those due to lo's atmosphere. Contiguous observations will minimize the effects of temporal variations in lo's atmosphere and the torus as a cause of the E-W asymmetry. These observations will also allow continued study of the long-term variations of the plasma torus begun in 1979. All additional US1 shift will be used to obtain a long-wavelength, high-dispersion spectrum of Io's trailing (W), plasma-bombarded hemisphere which will determine or set a, significant upper limit on the amount Of S02 gas in this hemisphere. Comparison of this observation with a similar exposure of Io's leading hemisphere done in 1987 will thus determine if there is a substantial difference in SO2 gas content between the two hemispheres, further constraining the origin of the observed E-W brightness asymmetry.|Y
SIMHM|IO and the Plasma Torus|H. Warren|Moos|Johns Hopkins University|Thirteenth episode IUE observations are requested to answer two of the most critical outstanding questions about lo and the plasma torus in which it is embedded: what is the nature of Io's tenuous atmosphere (i.e., is it collisionally thick or thin and is it asymmetric)? and will the plasma torus remain stable in the future given the decline in its emissions observed for the last few years? Although we currently possess an elementary understanding of the important physical processes controlling the torus, the process by which material is transported from Io to the torus is poorly understood. All scenarios for this process hinge critically on our understanding of lo's tenuous atmosphere. IUE currently provides the only measure of the major neutral constituents of Io's atmosphere and is the only facility currently available which can observe emissions from both Io and the plasma torus simultaneously. Near-simultaneous observations will be made of Io at both eastern and western elongation and of the eastern and western ansa of the plasma torus. Contiguous observations will permit deconvolution of the torus E-W brightness asymmetry (observed for the first time with the IUE in Nov 1989) from those due to Io's atmosphere, allowing tighter constraints to be placed on the postulated E-W asymmetry in Io's atmosphere; they will also minimize the effects of temporal variations. Long-wavelength, high-dispersion spectra of Io will tighten existing constraints (determined by IUE 11" and 12"' episode observations) on the amount Of S02 in Io's atmosphere, helping to determine whether it is collisionally thick or thin. We have a unique opportunity to evaluate the stability of the plasma torus via changes occurring in its UV emissions with new IUE observations. In addition, continued IUE observations are essential to ensure continuity and cross checking between the existing IUE data set and the up-coming observations of Io and the plasma torus already approved for the Hubble Space Telescope.|Y

Our current IUE program has discovered large ultraviolet spectral variations of the Galilean satellites but the data set is as yet too small to distinguish between areal and temporal variations. Further observations in the ultraviolet are expected to resolve this problem and finish mapping the continental sized differences in composition and to help understand phenomena such as lo's extended torus. The execution of these observations now, instead of later, will permit them to be used in assistance of Galileo, the Jupiter Orbiter/Probe mission.|Y

Observations are proposed that should allow a differentiation between the signature Of SO2 frost on the spectrum and the effects of the overlying vapor in the satellite's spectrum.

SJDDM|Ultraviolet Spectrophotometry of the Galilean Satellites of Jupiter|Dennis L.|Matson|Jet Propulsion Laboratory|We propose a continuation of our current IUE study of the ultraviolet spectral reflectances of the Galilean satellites of Jupiter. Our current IUE program has made significant breakthroughs in the last year by mapping the longitudinal distribution of frozen sulfur dioxide on Io, and identifying a longitudinally asymmetric ultraviolet spectral signature on Europa. Both of these findings will play an important role in future discussions of satellitemagnetosphere interactions. We have now clearly identified the areal variations in UV spectral signature on 2 of the 4 satellites but we have reason to believe that temporal variations also exist on a smaller scale. The proposed observations are expected to resolve the temporal variation problem, and to complete the longitudinal mapping of all four satellites.

SJEDM|Ultraviolet Spectrophotometry of the Galilean Satellites of Jupiter|Dennis L.|Matson|JPL|We propose a continuation of our current IUE study of the ultraviolet spectral reflectances of the Galilean satellites of Jupiter. Our previous IUE studies have successfully mapped the longitudinal distribution of frozen sulfur dioxide on Io, identified a longitudinally assymetric spectral absorption feature on Europa, and established the ultraviolet geometric albedos of all the satellites. Because of the important role of sulfur and sulfur dioxide on Io, and the transport of these materials from lo to the Jovian magnetosphere, the IUE studies are critical to a better understanding of the role of the magnetosphere in eroding and redepositing of satellite surface materials. Our current IUE program has given greater support to our hypothesis that, in addition to areal variations of the UV spectral signature on all four satellites on two of them temporal variations may also exist on a smaller scale. The proposed observations are expected to resolve the temporal variation problem, and to complete the longitudinal mapping of all four satellites.

Observations of the Jovian aurora in the south polar region will be monitored over a complete rotation of the planet to determine if the interaction with the magnetosphere is in fact localized in longitude. The ratio of the southern auroral intensity to that in the north will be determined. The average auroral intensity, the brightness of the Ly-alpha bulge and the ordinary dayglow Ly-alpha will be monitored; variations which are correlated with the decreasing solar activity will be of special significance.|Y
SJHDS|Observations of Hydrogen Emission from Jupiter|Donald E.|Shemansky|Arizona|Recent research on the equatorial EUV hydrogen emission from Jupiter at the time of the Voyager encounters in 1979 suggests that a large fraction of the H Ly-alpha emission was electron excited from an internally generated source.

Moreover, it has been suggested that the internally -3enerated source is catalyzed by solar radiation and thus may he related to the large long term variation in emission rates observed between times of minimum (1973-74) and maximum (1979) solar activity, We propose to obtain measurements of equatorial H Ly-alpha and H2 band intensities in 1985 in an attempt to determine if in fact the excitation processes follow an amplified response to the major solar cycle variation.

Observations of the Jovian polar aurora will be monitored to determine if the long-term spatial dependence of these emissions varies over the long term. The ratio of the southern auroral intensity to that in the north will also be determined. The long-term temporal behaviors of the auroral emissions, the Ly-alpha bulge, and the ordinary dayglow Ly-alpha will be monitored; variations which are correlated with the current period of decreasing solar activity will be of special significance.

SJHJW|Observations of Jovian ION Aurora|J. H.|Waite|NASA\Marshall Space Flight Center|We propose a combination of archival research and high S/N spectroscopy with the SWP camera under low dispersion to observe sulfur and oxygen emissions that are predicted to result from the Jovian ion aurora. The intensity of, or upper limit to, the observed emissions can be used in conjunction with aeronomical models to estimate the number flux of S and 0 ions into the Jovian atmosphere. Such a study of Jovian auroral emissions is important in evaluating the Voyager energetic particle measurements, which suggest that ion precipitation from the Jovian middle magnetosphere is the major source of aurorae at Jupiter. Since the longest archived spectrum of Jupiter's polar regions is only 40 minutes long, we propose 2 whole-shift US1 integrations to obtain the highest possible signal to noise auroral spectra in the critical range 1250-1500 A. We will further study the archived spectra both individually and summed for any possible variable S and/or 0 emissions, although none have been previously reported.|Y
SJIDS|Observations of Hydrogen Emission from Juptier|Donald E.|Shemansky|Arizona|Recent research on the equatorial EUV hydrogen emission from Jupiter at the time of the Voyager encounters in 1979 suggests that a large fraction of the H Ly-alphaa emission was electron excited from an internally generated source.

IUE data obtained in April 1985 shows a moderately reduced B Ly-alpha emission intensity, while the H, bands may have an increased intensity, relative to observations in 1979. The H Ly-alpha bulge phenomenon was still present. On the basis of these results a clear dependence of the emissions on solar cycle has not been established, and we require more observations in the time span of the mimimum in solar activity. We propose to obtain measurements of equatorial H Ly-alpha and H2 band intensities in 1986 in an attempt to determine if in fact the excitation processes follow an amplified response to the major solar cycle variation.

SJKDS|Observations of Hydrogen Emission from Jupiter|Donald E.|Shemansky|Arizona|We propose to continue observations of Jupiter electroglow H and H2 emissions with the purpose of establishing temporal dependence on the time scale of the major solar cycle and to compare with the behavior of the related phenomenon on Saturn. The evidence obtained to date indicates that the H Ly-alpha emissions on Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus show different variational scales over the same span of time. It is not clear that the variability depends on solar activity or radiative flux over the 11 year solar cycle, although low values of emission rate (with the exception of Uranus) tend to correspond roughly with solar minima. The relationship is certainly not linear or obvious, and observations to date have not provided a means of prediction even on an empirical basis. Uranus appears to present a significant exception in that IUE observations over a 5 year period seem to indicate a constant H Ly-alpha on a yearly scale. Although the relative brightness of the H Ly-alpha emission on Jupiter varies, the bulge phenomenon persists in all of the observations, showing a clear indication that collisional processes control the excitation. Solar radiation appears to be required as a stimulus, but the energy deposition mechanism is not established. In view of the distinct differences in temporal variations between the outer planets, it is clearly important to pursue a program of comparative planetology. H2 bands in the equatorial regions play an important role as indicators of atmospheric excitation and heating, and we propose to obtain observations of these emissions along with H Ly-alpha. The spectra are reduced using detailed models as reference data so that comparisons can be made directly with other experiments.|Y
SJKHM|Excitation of the Jovian Upper Atmosphere|H. Warren|Moos|Johns Hopkins University|Atomic and molecular hydrogen ultraviolet emissions near both the polar and the equatorial Jovian regions show spatial and temporal variations which can be used as tools to better understand the details of the energy deposition processes in the upper atmosphere of the planet. The emissions near the poles are due to precipitation of charged particles trapped in the magnetosphere, i.e. aurora, and show a dependence on magnetic longitude. Those near the equator may be due to both re-radiation of solar photons and poorly understood electron excitation processes; only the atomic hydrogen Lyman-alpha emission appears to show a longitudinal dependence. The IUE Observatory will map these emissions to determine if there are any temporal variations in their longitudinal dependence. These measurements will be combined with a long-term data set developed in previous programs to determine effects associated with long term trends, such as those caused by changes in the solar activity or any as yet undiscovered controlling agent. The possibility of a correlation between an increase in the auroral intensity and increases in the Io torus plasma density will also be examined. Furthermore, as part of the International Jupiter Watch, simultaneous ground-based observations of the auroral regions, for example in the infrared, will be coordinated in an effort to correlate the corresponding excitation processes. The weak molecular hydrogen emissions from the equatorial region are being studied using a statistical technique to analyze the spectra. Equatorial spectra with improved signal-to-noise will be obtained in order to provide an improved template spectrum for the statistical analysis and to help differentiate between candidate excitation processes. At certain times of the year, measurements of the solar wind directed towards Jupiter can be made with spacecraft about Venus and the Earth. Auroral measurements at these times will serve as a baseline for the infrequent large disturbances, which will be studied with a Target of Opportunity proposal.|Y
SJKJC|The Ionospheric Contribution to Jupiter's H Ly Bulge|John|Clarke|University of Michigan|There are currently multiple theories for the production of the bright H Ly-alpha emission region centered on Jupiter's magnetic equator, called the Ly-alpha bulge. Each theory must contain some connection to Jupiter's magnetic field, since the bulge emission is fixed with respect to magnetic longitude and not the atmosphere. The bulge emission also decreases by an order of magnitude in the dark atmosphere away from the terminators, suggesting a connection either to scattered sunlight and/or ionospheric plasma. The presence of several kR of emission from the dark atmosphere beyond the dawn terminator, at points magnetically connected to the dayside with much higher ionospheric densities, suggests that the flow of ionospheric plasma from sunlit to dark regions can produce several kR of H Ly-alpha emission in Jupiter's atmosphere. If ionospheric currents are also important in producing the bulge emission, the bulge brightness should increase with local time if the ionospheric densities build up over the course of a day, as observed on the earth. We propose to measure the brightness of the H Ly-alpha bulge region as it moves from sunrise to sunset over two separate US2 shifts to study this process and determine the contribution to the bulge emission from ionospheric processes. There is no existing measurement of the bulge brightness as it crosses the planet from dawn to dusk.|Y
SJKJW|Simultaneous UV and IR Observations of Jovian Aurora|J.

All observations will be carried out using the SWP camera under low dispersion. Results will be compared to observations of similar features at Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus observed in previous years by these same investigators under the IUE Guest Observer Program. The Jovian auroral observations will be carried out simultaneously with infrared observations using the NASA/IRTF and will also be compared to theoretical predictions of expected auroral UV and IR emissions from particle precipitation [Horanyi et al., 1987; Caldwell et al., 1980; 19831.|Y
SJKRW|Jovian Auroral Monitoring Coordinated with the IJW|Richard|Wagener|Suny|Jovian aurorae are complicated, time-dependent phenomena. Only recently has it been realized that they are observable from the Earth and infrared wavelengths (2 microns and 8 microns) as well as from space in the ultraviolet (120 nm - 160 nm). Comparison of multi-spectral observations uncoordinated in time would be meaningless because of the temporal variability. Under this proposal and one to be submitted to the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility in Hawaii, coordinated observations over the spectral range from 120 nm to 8 microns will be attempted for the first time. The geographic locations of these observatories ensures that interested observers in North and South America will be able to participate at the same time.

SJLJC|Doppler-Shifted H Lyman Alpha Emission from Jupiter's Aurora|John T.|Clarke|Michigan|In the past observing year we have initiated a program of high dispersion SWSA observations of Jupiter's auroral regions, initially expecting to measure a Doppler-broadened H Ly-alpha line profile from excitation by precipitating high energy protons. Surprisingly, no proton precipitation has been observed, but roughly 1/2 of the auroral H Ly-alpha emission is Doppler-shifted by an equivalent energy of 10-20 eV for a proton or fast H atom. Even more surprisingly, the dominant motion of the fast species is up out of the ionosphere. We interpret this as ionospheric protons excited by field-aligned potentials in a return current out of the ionosphere, and we now have a new diagnostic for the study of the ionospheric contribution to Jupiter's aurora. In the next year we propose to follow up on the initial discovery with more detailed observations to determine the velocity vector of the ionospheric current, and to study a potential latitudinal reversal of the current that appears in an archival spectrum.|Y

SJMJC|Dopper-Shifted H LY Alpha Emissions from Jupiter's Aurora and Equator|John T.|Clarke|Michigan|In recent years we have initiated a program of high dispersion observations of Doppler-shifted H Ly-alpha emission from Jupiter's aurora, and in November 1989 we began high dispersion observations of the equatorial regions. In the auroral zones the anticipated highly asymmetric profile indicative of proton precipitation (as seen on the Earth) has never appeared on Jupiter, although roughly 1/2 of the auroral Ly-alpha emission is Doppler-shifted by 40-50 km/sec mainly toward the blue (i.e. motion out of the ionosphere). We interpret this as in situ acceleration of ionospheric plasma by auroral electric fields, by analogy to the Earth, and we now propose to further investigate this phenomenon and to pin down the location of the acceleration region(s). Last month we also detected Doppler-shifted Ly-alpha emission wings on the equatorial line, representing a roughly 1 kR emitter with a motion in the direction of the planet's spin but at a rate of 40-50 km/sec (compared with the 10 km/sec spin velocity). We suggest initially that this emitter consists of nearly orbiting (orbital v = 40 km/sec) fast H atoms leaving the exobase: this implies both an asymmetric equatorial ionosphere and also a substantial source of plasma into the inner magnetosphere. We propose to observe this phenomenon in more detail in the upcoming year.|Y

The polar auroral emissions are a result of the precipitation of charged particles from the magnetospheric plasma, and have a distinctive dependence on magnetic longitude suggestive of either variable precipitation flux, variable primary particle energy, or both. The diffuse equatorial dayglow emissions in Ly-alpha and H2 Lyman-bands are associated with solar Irradiation but exceed the solar energy Input. They may thus be due to some mix of resonantly scattered solar Ly-alpha photons, fluorescence, and electron excitation processes. The proposed work will compare intensities and color ratios between the north and south polar aurorae to assess the degree of similarity between the two. Measurements of auroral intensity made in conjunction with IUE observations of the lo plasma torus (separate proposal) will examine the correlation of auroral and magnetospheric activity. Observations of the dayglow emissions will investigate the correspondence of dayglow intensity with solar activity. In addition, because the equatorial spectra are generally brighter at near solar maximum than at solar minimum, the brighter spectra may be useful for comparison with the various postulated dayglow excitation mechanisms. The auroral and equatorial spectra will be compared to search for correlations in emission activity which might be due to the aurora's impact on the global energy budget. As in the 12th and 13th episodes, some observations will be coordinated with simultaneous ground observations through the International Jupiter Watch. These observations will be used to examine the case to be made for direct auroral modification of the Jovian upper stratosphere/thermosphere.|Y
SKKAM|Sanduleak's Star: A Possible Supernova Progenitor in the LMC|Andrew G.|Michalitsianos|NASA/GSFC|The pronounced enhancement of nitrogen relative to carbon emission in the SWP  1200-2000 wavelength range of Sanduleak's Star in the Large Magellanic Cloud is strikingly similar to the emission line spectrum which characterizes the SCondensation in -Carinae, and provides one of the first clear examples of an object which exhibits evidence for CNO processing in another galaxy. Far-UV spectra obtained previously with IUE of Sanduleak's Star (LMC Anonymous) provides compelling evidence that the surface composition of this star contains highly processed nuclear-synthesized material. LORES-SWP spectra obtained nearly three years apart indicate that C IV emission is variable, while the emission lines of N V, N IV] and N III] appear to remain essentially constant. The progenitor stars of Type II supernova are believed to undergo a significant phase of mass loss via a high velocity wind, in which core-envelope mixing results in a significant overabundance of nitrogen relative to carbon at the stellar surface, prior to core collapse. Thus, the supernova remnant is expected to contain enhanced nitrogen. The 14N/12C ratio of LMC Anonymous has been found previously to lie in the range 70 to 150, which brackets the value determined for the remnant of the recent supernova in the LMC. The similarity of LMC Anonymous with Eta-Carinae in the far-UV provides further indications that Sanduleak's Star could become a Type II supernova. IUE observations are proposed to further investigate the properties of this unusual object for possible time-dependent effects in the abundance of carbon.|Y

SLBBH|Measurement of the Far-UV Spectral Reflectances of Selected Lunar Areas and Possible Mercury Using the IUE|Bruce|Hapke|Pittsburgh|It is proposed to measure the continuum spectral reflectance of selected lunar areas from 1200 to 3200A using the IUE in the low dispersion mode. These measurements would characterize the UV spectral properties of representative geological units on the moon. The data would extend the spectra of these areas taken at longer wavelengths and potentially yield new information about their composition. The measurements would also give a secondary calibration of the IUE by comparison with laboratory spectra of Apollo lunar samples.  It is also proposed to observe Mercury while the IUE is in the shadow of the earth. if possible, in order to make similar measurements of the spectral reflectance of the Mercurian regolith.|Y
SLOCA|A Study of UV Interstellar Extinction Along Sight Lines Sampled by WUPPE|Christopher M.|Anderson|U Wisconsin - Madison|During the 1990 December flight of Astro-1 the Wisconsin Ultraviolet Photo Polarimeter Experiment (WUPPE) observed six stars specifically chosen to sample the interstellar polarization. It was found that there is considerable variation in the wavelength dependence of the interstellar polarization along these sight lines (Clayton et.al. 1992). For three of the objects the polarization was well described by an extrapolation of the Serkowski law from the visible and IR. Two of the targets had polarization in excess of the Serkowski extrapolation and one showed a distinct polarization enhancement at the 2175 A extinction bump. IUE observations exist for only three of the stars. The three which have NOT been observed by IUE include one Serkowski-like star, one super-Serkowski target and the bump feature object. We propose to obtain both LWP and SWP exposures of these three objects in order to establish the characteristics of the interstellar EXTINCTION of these sight lines in the same was as has previously been done for the stars which have been observed by IUE.|Y

SMBAL|IUE Observations of Mars|Arthur L.|Lane|JPL|It is proposed to use IUE to make a series of observations of Mars. IUE will contribute substantially to our knowledge of the spatial and temporal variability of ozone on Mars because it will be able to observe the ozone during Martian seasons in which there are no previous measurements. These measurements can provide an important check on our understanding of the photochemistry of ozone on Mars. Four observing periods totaling seven eight-hour shifts are requested. These four observing periods are distributed throughout calendar year 1979.|Y

SMLDS|A Search for Cometesimal Derived Atmosphere on the Moon|Donald E.|Shemansky|Arizona|The discovery of sodium and potassium as atmospheric constituents of the moon has raised questions on the nature of the sources and the possible presence of species expected to be more abundant on the basis of mixing ratios in source material. Sources of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen volatiles are of particular interest, in view of suggestions that interstellar dust particles, meteoroids and the proposed cometesimals may provide significant influx rates. In fact it is somewhat mystifying in view of the detections of sodium and potassium, that oxygen was not detected in the earlier Apollo experiments. We propose to make observations above the sunlit limb of the moon using the IUE SWP and LWP spectrographs in order to set limits on these constituents based on solar scattering probabilities. The hydroxyl radical (OH) may be the best prospect as a detectable species.|Y
SMMDS|A Search for Cometesimal Derived Atmosphere on the Moon|Donald E.|Shemansky|Arizona|The composition of the Lunar atmosphere shows the remarkable property of having abundances of sodium and potassium that are comparable to the upper limits that have been placed on species such as oxygen. The insertion rate for oxygen from the various sources is substantially larger than the cosmically minor Na and K. The problem is compounded by the fact that basic loss processes are significantly larger for the metallic elements, further enhancing predicted relative abundances of atmospheric oxygen. One of the major sources of oxygen is derived from H20 in meteor and comet impacts. H2O is reduced mainly by dissociation to OH, which has a large g value for solar scattering at 3085A, and we propose to search for OH above the sunlit limb with IUE. According to our calculations, the episodic nature of comet input can produce H20 ice layers in the permanently shadowed regions near the poles, which form a source of OH through photodissociation by LISM H Ly-alpha. We propose to search for the possible enhanced source of OH in 3085A scattered solar radiation in the Lunar polar regions.|Y
SMOAB|Simultaneous Multiwavelength Study of "Speedy Mic"|Alexander|Brown|Colorado - JILA|HDI97890 ("Speedy Mic") is a newly-discovered, rapidly-rotating, single K dwarf belonging to the Pleiades Group. Speedy Mic has a rotation period of 8.1 hours and an apparent rotational velocity of 120 km s^-1 The star was discovered to be a strong EUV source during the ROSAT Wide Field Camera sky survey, when it underwent a large flare whose decay lasted over 20 hours. Subsequent optical observations have shown it to be chromospherically-active. Speedy Mic may well be even more active than its well-known active counterpart AB Dor (rot. period 12.3 hours; v sin i 70 kin s^-1).  We propose to obtain contemporaneous multiwavelength observations of Speedy Mic that will include the first IUE observations of this star. Observations over 3 rotational periods will be used to search for further evidence of rotational modulation and flaring. The resultant data will be used to model the outer atmospheric structure of this extremely unusual star.|Y
SMOGS|An UV Spectrophotometric Census of B Supergiants in the SMC|George|Sonneborn|NASA/GSFC|We are proposing an intensive observing program to obtain low-dispersion IUE spectra for a complete set of B-type supergiants in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). These data will be used to address a variety of questions: How does massive star evolution differ in a metal-poor galaxy? What are their basic physical parameters of temperature, surface gravity, luminosity, abundance anomalies, and mass loss? What are the regional variations in the SMC extinction law? How can pre- and post-red supergiant phases be distinguished spectroscopically? The data for O- and B-type supergiants, using the proposed observations augmented by O and B star spectra from the IUE archives, will also be used to derive an "integrated" UV spectrum for the SMC. The composite UV spectrum of a well-studied lowmetallicity stellar population is needed for the study of more distant metal-poor galaxies where individual stars are not resolved.  There is clearly much that we do not understand about the evolution of massive stars, and the SMC provides an excellent location for study. The census of SMC blue supergiants is very complete, and optical studies of these stars provides an important stepping stone for our UV work.|Y

SNFRK|IUE Supernova Spectroscopy|Robert P.|Kirshner|Michigan|Ultraviolet observations of supernovae can provide unique insight into the mechanism of these stellar catastrophes. We propose to use the IUE to obtain spectra of supernovae as they are discovered and obtain coordinated ground-based observations. IUE observations of Type I supernovae combined with ground based spectrophotometry will be used to determine the continuum energy distribution and bolometric luminosity, an important constraint on theoretical models of these explosions. Observations of Type II events are particularly useful in studying the circumstellar material that may have been shed in stellar instabilities preceeding the cataclysm and can help establish the energy budget of these extremely luminous events. Both types of supernova can be used to examine the interstellar medium of the Galaxy.|Y
SNHJC|IUE Solar System Observations I. Uranus and Neptune|John J.|Caldwell|Stony Brook|Previous work has produced good quality spectra of Uranus below 2000 A with the SWP camera. Observations proposed here are intended to produce comparable information on Neptune. Specific scientific objectives are to search for H2 emission features from possible aurorae on Neptune and for near 1600 A absorption features due to trace gases. A prime candidate is C2H2,which has prominent band structure between 1700 and 1900 A. From 2000 to 3000 A, LWP spectra of Uranus, Neptune and G stars will be used to improve the absolute calibration of the albedo of both planets. A specific objective is to determine the presence or absence of broad continuum absorption on both planets, which is suspected from early broadband photometry. If it is present, modelling including Rayleigh scattering should establish its vertical distribution. The data will also be uniquely valuable for calibrating Voyager photopolarimetric observations.|Y
SNHJS|Shock Processing of Interstellar Grains in Monoceros|J. Michael|Shull|Colorado-Lasp|Supernova remnants are believed to play a significant role in altering both the population and structure of dust grains in the interstellar medium. Shock models with grain-grain collisions and gas-grain sputtering suggest that substantial grain processing can occur at velocities as low as 40 km/s, as well as alterations in the UV extinction curve (Seab and Shull 1983). However, it has been difficult to find many clear instances in which variations among different regions can be attributed to SNR shocks or stellar wind activity.  The Monoceros Loop SNR offers an excellent opportunity. The remnant is large in angular size, is relatively nearby (-I kpc), and has low reddening (E(B-V) < 0.5). Most important, the Mon Loop direction offers several excellent foreground and background stars of early type, towards which the effects of shock processing can be observed.  We-propose to obtain both high and low resolution UV spectra of 11 carefully selected OB stars in and around the Mon Loop. Our objectives are: (1) examine variations in the UV selective extinction curves (2200 A "bump" and far-UV rise) with position; (2) compare depletions of heavy elements and reddening curves with our theoretical shock-code predictions; and (3) compare the heavy element column densities (especially Fe II, Si II, Mn II, and Zn II) with those predicted for high velocity shocks.|Y
SNHRF|UV Observation of the Blue Star Behind the Young Type I SNR of Ad 1006|Robert A.|Fesen|Colorado|Wu et al. (1983) recently reported IUE ultraviolet spectra taken of an sdOB star situated behind the young galactic supernova remnant of AD 1006. These data suggested very strong and broad Fe+ resonance absorption lines together with ~5000 km s^-1 redshifted Si^+,  Si^+2, and Si^+3 absorption features. If true this would be the first direct piece of evidence for high velocity and heavy element enriched ejecta within a young and suspected Type I supernova remnant. It is, furthermore, consistent with Type I SNR model predictions and would explain the lack of heavy element detection in SN 1006 via X-ray emissions.  However, the conclusions reached by Wu et al. are not universally accepted. The UV spectrum of the star is rather noisy making both the high redshift silicon feature identifications and equivalent widths for the Fe^+ resonance lines quite uncertain. An additional single new observation obtained during the 6th year of IUE operation did not significantly improve the situation.  This kind of valuable UV investigation cannot be unfortunately repeated with any other known or suspected young galactic (or extragalactic) supernova remnants. This is because almost all other young remnants have large foreground reddening, uncertain distance estimates, and no known early-type centrally located background stars, Therefore, it is clearly of vital importance for our understanding of Type I SN to obtain additional UV spectra of this background star in order to resolve the questions of high velocity silicon and iron absorption features. The exposure times are already known and the data collection and analysis are quite feasible and straightforward. We propose, therefore, the taking of 3 SWP and LWP additional spectra of this star. These would provide a better than factor of two increase in signal-to-noise and three individual new spectra which would allow 1) confirmation of the high velocity redshifted Si lines, 2) more accurate Fe+ line profile and equivalent widths providing a better iron mass estimate, and 3) investigation of Co and Ni lines hinted by the Wu et al. spectra.|Y
SNHWB|An Oxygen-Rich Supernova Remnant in the Small Magellanic    Cloud|William|Blair|Johns Hopkins University|We wish to obtain long, collaborative SWP and LWP large aperture spectra of a young, oxygen-rich supernova remnant in the Small Magellanic Cloud. These data will be used in conjunction with various theoretical calculations to (1) derive the physical conditions of the emitting gas,(2) find the abundances of carbon and silicon relative to oxygen, and (3) estimate the mass of the precursor star that created this remnant. Optical data indicate that the reddening toward the remnant is low [E(B-V) < 0.05]. A < 5 hour SWP exposure during Round 7 has detected the object, but the signal is too weak for serious interpretation. The long exposures requested here will significantly improve the comparison to models.|Y

This gas is also potentially observable in the infrared, so that independent quantitative estimates of its abundance may be possible. Such an analysis has been done for Uranus.|Y
SNIJR|The Vela Supernova Remnant|John C.|Raymond|Harvard CFA - SAO|We wish to obtain both emission and absorption line observations of the Vela Supernova remnant. The filament we wish to study in emission is the brightest filament in the SNR, so it will provide a spectrum twice the quality of any in existence. It is also located at the edge of an unusual bulge in the SNR, and it can be used to test the level of departure from pressure equilibrium in the remnant, which is useful as a test of evaporative models of SNR evolution. The absorption line studies will look for evidence of the drastically unstable behavior of shocks above 150 km/s predicted by Innes and Giddings. Four of the stars studied by Jenkins, Silk and Wallerstein showed marginal evidence for two positive or two negative high velocity components. If these multiple velocity components are confirmed, they support the secondary shock predictions of Innes and Giddings.|Y
SNIRK|Supernova Spectroscopy|Robert P.|Kirshner|CFA|Ultraviolet observations of supernovae can provide unique insight into these stellar catastrophes. We propose to use the IUE to obtain spectra of newly-discovered bright supernovae. The current set of UV data on supernovae is limited, and while it shows that UV data are an important addition to our understanding of supernovae, good data sets have been obtained for only a few objects. It is important to supernova research to expand the coverage to include at least one well-observed SN I and to see the variation in UV properties of SN II. In the case of SN I, the UV observations place important constraints on the theoretical models by revealing the bolometric energy distribution as well as chemical properties. In the case of SN II, IUE observations are especially useful in studying the circumstellar material that surrounds the explosion. Supernovae of either type can be used to examine the halo and disk of our galaxy and the galaxy in which the supernova is located.|Y
SNJJC|H LY Alpha Emission From Neptune|John T.|Clarke|NASA/GSFC|Two attempts have been made to date with IUE to detect th: H Ly-alpha emission from Neptune, using US2 shifts in 1983 and US1 shift in August 1986. Using the same observing technique which detected the aurora and electroglow on Uranus at an average brightness (over 4 year's time) of 1400 Rayleighs no emission has been detected from Neptune with a one sigma upper limit in the range 200-300 R. However, the emission from Uranus varied by a factor of 3 from faintest to brightest, and it remains both possible and theoretically expected that Neptune should appear brighter than 200 R. In addition to the scientific interest in the electroglow process and the question of the existence of a magnetosphere at Neptune, the electroglow H Ly-alpha emission is believed to be functionally related to the upper atmospheric heating and temperature. The Voyager project is keenly interested in the temperature (i.e. the vertical extent) of the upper atmosphere of Neptune in planning their trajectory as close to the planet as possible to get a close look at Triton, and to date the IUE upper limit to H Ly-alpha emission is the only constraint. I am therefore applying for 2 US1 shifts each year until the August 1989 Voyager encounter to attempt to further constrain the Neptune upper atmospheric conditions in support of the Voyager project.|Y
SNJRK|Continuing Spectroscopy of SN 1987A|Robert P.|Kirshner|CFA Harvard|The bright supernova 1987a is a unique event that deserves through study in the ultraviolet. An excellent start on that work has been made using target-of-opportunity time and discretionary time in the first week after discovery.

This proposal outlines a plan that would use approximately 20 US1 shifts and would result in an excellent ultraviolet record of this once-in-a-lifetime event.|Y
SNKRK|Continuing Spectroscopy of SN1987A|Robert P.|Kirshner|Harvard CFA - SAO|The ultraviolet study of SN 1987A has proved rewarding and the opportunities for further work in the coming year are both feasible and valuable. The nature of the progenitor, the composition and dynamics of the surface layers, and the Interstellar medium in the LMC and in the Milky Way have all been investigated with the UV data in hand. Current work shows strong evidence for circumstellar matter, perhaps the result of a red giant phase for the progenitor. Future work will help reveal the extent of this shell, and will also provide evidence on the composition of the interior of the exploded star. The supernova Is Increasing slowly in UV brightness at present (November 1987), and a reasonable estimate of the required coverage can be made which will provide an excellent record of the ultraviolet evolution for this once-in-a-lifetime event.|Y
SNLRK|Supernova Spectroscopy|Robert P.|Kirshner|Harvard|The ultraviolet study of SN 1987A demonstrates the value of having a target of opportunity program to study supernovae. The ultraviolet data were gathered promptly, with some understanding of their ultimate scientific use, and the data were used to investigate the stellar progenitor, the kinematics and composition of the explosion, the energy distribution of the flux, the interstellar medium in our Galaxy and in the LMC, and now show strong evidence for circumstellar matter surrounding the explosion. The utility of UV observations to the field of supernovae is clearly established by this work, and by earlier studies. However, it is clear that the field is not exhausted. Despite the outstanding work on SN 1987A, the current set of UV data on supernovae is limited, and the objects demonstrate a wide variety of behavior in the UV which needs further study.

SNLRW|Solar System Observations I. Neptune During the Voyager Encounter|Richard|Wagener|Suny|The Voyager encounter with Neptune in August 1989 is a unique event that is not likely to be repeated within our lifetimes. Our goal is to enhance the scientific value of the Voyager observations as much as possible. The proposed IUE observations are complementary to the in situ Voyager data. The IUE extends the wavelength coverage of the UVS spectrometer on Voyager longward of 1700 A. The LWP observations provide an absolute calibration and complementary spectral information for the PPS broadband photometry. Since Neptune is known to be variable in the visible, it is important to take the IUE observations at the same time as the Voyager encounter, which will be well into the next solar maximum. A comparison with our earlier Neptune observations in the years of low solar activity 1983 to 1986 will provide solar variability information over the entire IUE wavelength range. Coverage of the entire wavelength range is necessary to determine the altitude of the variable component in the Neptunian atmosphere. We propose to also observe Neptune over an entire rotation (17.7 h) with the LWP and simultaneously take ground-based methane band images to determine the vertical extent of the cloud features that show so prominently in these ground-based images.|Y
SNLSS|IUE Observations of Triton and Neptune at the Time of the Voyager Encounter|S. Alan|Stern|Colorado LASP|The Voyager II spacecraft will encounter Triton on 25 August 1989, however, the Voyager instrument payload is not capable of obtaining spectra in the region 1700-3200A. We propose to conduct observations of Triton and Neptune in this spectral band during the period of the Voyager encounter.  As described below, the proposed observations will both complement the Voyager measurements and provide new data. In the past, members of this proposal team have made IUE observations of both Triton and Neptune. Most recently, in August 1988, we conducted the first successful UV observations of Triton (Stern, at al. 1989).  Our specific observational objectives for Triton are to obtain two low-dispersion exposures (one at each Triton's eastern and western elongation) to document Triton's mid -UV spectrum at the time of the Voyager encounter, and to search for hemispheric differences between the opposite faces of Triton. We will analyze these data: (i) to determine the albedo and albedo slope of Triton in the region 2400-3200A, (ii) to make detailed comparisons of the UV reflectance properties of the two hemispheres, (iii) to make comparisons with the 1988 IUE single-exposure at western elongation hemisphere to search for evidence of time variation since the 1988 observation, and (iv) to make comparisons with IUE spectra of Pluto and various planetary satellites..  Our observational objectives for Neptune are to obtain a series of LWP low-dispersion spectra of Neptune in conjunction with the Voyager flyby to document the UV reflectance properties between 1825 and 3200A (which Voyager's UVS cannot measure) low dispersion SWP exposure to measure the the UV spectrum from 1700-1900A and a single high resolution LWP Echelle exposure to study Raman scattering near 2800A. We will analyze these data to determine several key parameters, including the atmospheric scattering properties and C2H2 absorption strengths.  The proposed 1989 measurements represent the only foreseeable opportunity to make remote UV observations of Triton and Neptune while another spacecraft is making in situ studies.|Y
SNLWB|UV Observations of the Supernova Remnant N49 in the LMC|William P.|Blair|Johns Hopkins University|N49 is the highest optical surface brightness supernova remnant in the Large Magellanic Cloud, yet very little information is available on its UV emission properties. In particular, even at two previously observed positions, no LWP spectra exist so the effects of resonant scattering cannot be effectively addressed. We have recently obtained excellent interference filter imagery of the supernova remnant and analysis of this imagery shows locations in N49 where shock development is very different from the locations which have been observed previously. We will study specific regions of high and low ionization to investigate the range of shock velocities present in this object, and we will perform detailed abundance analyses of this remnant by combining our optical imagery and spectra with the IUE observations.|Y
SNMGS|Continuing Ultraviolet Spectroscopy of SN 1987A|George|Sonneborn|NASA/GSFC|The ultraviolet study of SN 1987A has proved rewarding and the opportunities for further work in the coming year are both feasible and valuable. The nature of the progenitor, the composition and dynamics of the surface layers, and the interstellar medium in the LMC and in the Milky Way have all been investigated with the UV data in hand. Current work concentrates on the radiation from the debris and the circumstellar material surrounding the progenitor. The decline of N V and N III] fluxes from this circumstellar gas has leveled off, implying that the geometry and/or density structure of the circumstellar material is more complex than a single density, spherically symmetric shell. The future evolution of the lines will reveal further information about this circumstellar material and the evolution of the supernova progenitor.  The supernova is declining more slowly in the UV than in the optical. Consequently, the UV is now an important fraction of the bolometric luminosity. In the coming year the bolometric light curve will again test nucleosynthesis models as the longer-lived isotope 57CO overtakes 56Co as the primary source of radioactive decay energy in the ejecta. The evolution of the UV, fluxes also bear directly on the characteristics and distribution of newly-formed dust within the ejecta. The proposed observations will provide an excellent record of the ultraviolet evolution for this once-in-a-lifetime event.|Y
SNMJR|Emission and Absorption Study of the Vela Supernova Remnant|John C.|Raymond|Harvard SAO - CFA|The combination of emission and absorption studies of the shocked gas in a supernova remnant can provide information not available from either study by itself, especially relating to the liberation of refractory elements from interstellar grains in the cooling zone behind the shock and the effects of departures from steady flow. No such combined studies have been attempted due to the need for a hot, bright background star behind supernova remnant nebulosity bright enough for emission line observations. Wallerstein and Balick have discovered a suitable patch of nebulosity in the Vela Supernova Remnant adjacent to the B3 III star HD 72088. IUE spectra of the star show a 94 km/s component in C IV and Si IV in absorption, and the optical spectra of Wallerstein and Balick show strong high excitation emission lines close to the star. We wish to obtain IUE spectra of the nebulosity as close to the star as possible and further high dispersion spectra of the star to improve the signal-tonoise.|Y
SNMPW|Circumstellar Material in the Puppis A Supernova Remnant|P. Frank|Winkler|Middlebury College|We propose to obtain ultraviolet spectra of the brightest optical filament in Puppis A, located along the northwest rim of the supernova remnant. Optical spectra of this and other bright filaments have extremely strong nitrogen lines and indicate a high nitrogen abundance. The most likely interpretation is that the filaments are made up of CNO-processed material shed by the star prior to the supernova event. The quasistationary flocculi in Cas A appear similar to the Puppis A filaments, and are likely of similar origin. Nitrogenrich material has also been observed surrounding SN1987A. The likelihood that SN1987A (~3 yr old), Cas A (~330 yr), and Puppis A (~3700 yr) are similar objects at different evolutionary stages enhances interest in the older remnants.  In the ultraviolet we expect to see strong lines of N III], N IV] and perhaps N V, which together with the optical lines of [N II] and [N I] should enable us to constrain tightly models for the physical conditions in the Puppis A filaments and the shocks that excite them. Lines of carbon and oxygen will be used to investigate abundances in the circumstellar material.  Our positive detection with IUE of UV lines from a faint oxygen-rich filament in Puppis A makes prospects for a good spectrum from a much brighter nitrogen-rich filament very favorable.|Y

Supernovae of either type can be used to examine the interstellar gas in the disk and halo of our Galaxy and of the galaxy in which the supernova is located.|Y
SNMWB|UV Observations of the Cygnus Loop Based on Voyager Data|William P.|Blair|Johns Hopkins|We are analyzing a large body of Voyager Ultraviolet Spectrometer data on the Cygnus Loop supernova remnant. Voyager spectra covering the entire Cygnus Loop have been assembled into spatial maps of the Cygnus Loop in two sub-Ly-alpha emission peaks at 980 A and 1035 A. Comparison of these maps with Einstein and optical imaging data indicate very strong UV emission from portions of the X-ray shell of the Cygnus Loop on the north and northwest limb that have exceedingly faint optical emission. These regions are thought to be "nonradiative" shocks at the position of the main SNR blast wave. Nonradiative shocks are extremely important because one can study the physics of the shock front itself. The positions of other observations of nonradiative shocks in the Cygnus Loop were selected based on relatively strong Balmer line emission and in retrospect may be already in transition to the radiative phase. Here we propose to obtain SWP and LWP spectra of two new positions in the Cygnus Loop which will provide cleaner examples of the nonradiative shock phenomenon for detailed study. We also request two shifts to obtain LWP spectra at the two previously observed IUE nonradiative shock positions for comparison.|Y
SNNGS|Continuing Ultraviolet Spectroscopy of SN 1987A|George|Sonneborn|NASA/GSFC|The ultraviolet study of SN 1987A with IUE continues to produce unique and important observations. The opportunities for further work in the coming year are both feasible and valuable; no supernova has ever been observed this long after outburst. The nature of the progenitor, the composition and dynamics of the surface layers, and the interstellar medium in the LMC and in the Milky Way have all been investigated with the UV data in hand. Current work concentrates on the radiation from the explosion debris and the fluorescing circumstellar material which surrounds the supernova. The future evolution of the circumstellar emission lines will provide a sensitive probe of the progenitor's evolution 30, 000 to 100, 000 years before the explosion.  The ultraviolet spectrum of the supernova contains an increasing fraction of its bolometric luminosity. In the coming year the bolometric light curve will test nucleosynthesis models as longer-lived isotopes 57Co and 44Ti are expected to replace 56CO as the primary source of radioactive decay energy in the ejecta. The evolution of the UV fluxes also bear directly on the characteristics and distribution of riewly-formed dust within the ejecta. The proposed observations will extend the excellent record of the ultraviolet evolution for this once-in-a-lifetime event.|Y
SNNRK|Supernova Spectroscopy|Robert P.|Kirshner|Harvard University|The ultraviolet study of SN 1987A vividly demonstrates the value of having a target of opportunity program to study supernovae. In 1990, in 1991, in 1992, in 1993, and in 1994 thanks to the prompt operation of this Target of Opportunity program, we obtained valuable series of UV spectra for SN 1990N, SN 1991T, SN 1992A, SN 1993J and SN 19941. Combined with observations made later with HST, this program provides the best UV spectra and interesting insight into the models for exploding stars and their circumstellar surround. A powerful new set of analytic tools has been developed that allows spectrum synthesis for the UV spectra of supernovae.  Despite these successes, the field is not exhausted. The current set of UV data on supernovae is limited, and the objects demonstrate a wide variety of behavior in the UV which needs further study. We propose to use the IUE to obtain spectra of newly-discovered bright supernovae. IUE has the vital advantage over HST that it is easy to introduce new objects into the observing plan, and to move swiftly while the supernova is still bright in the UV. It is important to supernova research to expand the coverage of SN Ia, to examine the varieties of SN Ib spectra and to see the variation in properties for SN II.|Y
SNOAC|SN 1987A Light Echoes: Direct Determination of UV Shock Breakout Flux|Arlin P. S.|Crotts|Columbia University|Light echoes (transient reflection nebulae) from SN1987A were discovered in the optical in 1988 and detected in the vacuum ultraviolet soon thereafter by IUE. These allowed the first direct observation of the hot spectrum emitted by a supernova shock destroying the progenitor star. This spectrum has been modified by the spectral reflectance of the echoing dust, however. We propose to disentangle the effects of incident spectrum and dust reflectance by observing the echo at another scattering phase angle, providing us with enough independent information to factor these separately. This spectrum will allow a direct test of theoretical models of supernova shock propagation and breakout from a star, as well as provide an accurate input ionization spectrum for understanding the excitation and recombination of gas in the observed circumstellar nebulosity around SN1987A.|Y
SNODM|High-Velocity Gas in the SN1991T/3C273 Sightline|David M.|Meyer|Northwestern University|Meyer & Roth (1991) have recently obtained high SIN observations of the Ca II absorption toward SN1991T and 3C273 which exhibit weak components at vLSR=-87, +215, and +263 km s^-1 toward SN1991T that are absent in the adjacent (sep.=1.4degrees) 3C273 sightline. In this proposal, we discuss our plans to test the local hypothesis for these high-velocity clouds (HVCs) by observing the interstellar Mg II absorption toward several stars in the SN1991T/3C273 field with IUE. Although the many HVCs observed in H I 21 cm emission have not yet been conclusively detected in metal absorption against any Galactic source (Wakker 1991), our particular search is worthwhile given that: (1) the general issue of HVC distances remains unclear due to metallicity uncertainties and, (2) the SN1991T/3C273 sightline presents a possibly unique case where there is radio continuum evidence of a local disturbance.|Y

SNOLD|High Signal-to-Noise Observations of the Intermediate Velocity Arch|Laura|Danly|STScI|Most of the gas that appears to be falling in from the halo to the disk is located in the Northern Galactic Hemisphere, and is concentrated in a few large, coherent arch-like structures. Over the past two years, we have observed stars in the direction of these arches in an effort to determine the gas characteristics via ultraviolet absorption line spectroscopy. We have identified four stars which lie behind the Intermediate Velocity Arch (IV Arch) and have found significant variations in the observed line strengths and ion ratios.  We wish to extend these studies by (1) obtaining additional images of two stars from our previous sample in order to increase signal-to-noise, and (2) obtaining images toward three now stars to put limits on the distance to the Arch and, if detected, to analyze the absorption data for further insight into the nature of the gas in the Arch.|Y
SNORK|Supernova Spectroscopy|Robert P.|Kirshner|Harvard CFA - SAO|The ultraviolet study of SN 1987A vividly demonstrates the value of having a target of opportunity program to study supernovae. In 1990, and in 1991 thanks to the prompt operation of this Target of Opportunity program, we obtained two valuable series of UV spectra for SN 1990N and SN 1991T, both of which were discovered well before maximum light. This provides the best UV spectra, important information on the heating of the star by radioactivity, and interesting insight into the models for exploding white dwarfs. A powerful new set of analytic tools has been developed that allows spectrum synthesis for the UV spectra of supernovae.  Despite these successes, it is clear that the field is not exhausted.

SNOWK|Obscuration and Age Effects in Starburst Nuclei|William C.|Keel|U Alabama|Multiwavelength observations of starburst nuclei show that the role of obscuration within the nucleus is crucial in deriving physical properties. Stars are more obscured than the prominent ionized gas component, so that use of simple H II region models leads to seriously biased results on burst age or IMF. We have used simple geometric models to show how such effects occur, and hope to extend their use to a representative sample of nearby starbursts through new IUE data. We also propose observations of clearly old bursts, defined through highly composite stellar populations, to test ways of distinguishing the effects of age and obscuration in starbursts.|Y
SNOYC|A New SNR Candidate Hidden in the Luminous HII Region N 159|You-Hua|Chu|U Illinois|A fast expanding shell is found in the luminous H II region N 159 in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The size (23pc) and expansion velocity (~250km s^-1) of this shell are more compatible with a supernova remnant (SNR) than with a wind-blown bubble. However, the normal procedure of using X-ray and radio observations to confirm that this shell is a SNR is not possible because of the proximity of the bright Xray source LMC X-1 and the fact that the shell is superposed on the luminous HII region N 159. If the SNR nature of this shell can be confirmed this would have significant implications for the estimate of the supernova rate in the LMC. Therefore, we propose to take a high dispersion UV spectrum of the B0.5 I star Sk -69 257 near the shell center and use the interstellar absorption lines to study this shell and confirm its SNR nature.|Y

The interaction between rapidly expanding ejecta from SN 1987A and its circumstellar environment, i.e. the birth of a supernova remnant, is an important astrophysical process never before witnessed in a young supernova. There is now evidence that this interaction has already started as a newly formed radio supernova remnant. The future evolution of the circumstellar emission lines and the ejecta-CS matter interaction will provide a sensitive probe of the progenitor's evolution 30,000 to 100,000 years before the explosion,|Y

SOLAD|A Study of the Stellar Population in Selected SO Galaxies|Anthony C.|Danks|ARC|We propose to obtain IUE short wavelength (1200-2000 A) and long wavelength (2000-3000 A) spectra of a few selected SO or Lenticular galaxies to determine their stellar contents. The particular emphasis is on looking for evidence of recent star formation, as indicated by the presence of early-type stars. This is an important test of galaxy models in which SO galaxies are differentiated from normal Spirals by a very low gas content. The complete UV spectrum, SWP and LWP, covered by IUE provides optimum information on the OB stellar populations (130 to 4 M(sun)) and on late-type populations (4 to 0.5 M(sun)), respectively. Recent IRAS observations show evidence for non-cirrus type emission, i.e., warm dust; the proposed IUE observations will look for evidence of the star formation normally associated with the dust and cold gas. It is our intention to define the morphology of the galaxies to be studied through CCD images in the visible, infrared, via IRAS, and visual photometry. We emphasize that to date, SO galaxies have not been studied as a homogeneous class.|Y
SOOMC|Variation of the Solar Lyman Alpha Line Profile with Solar Activity|Michael R.|Combi|U Michigan|The integrated line flux of the solar Lyman-alpha line profile is known to vary with solar activity. There is a long-term variation with the 11-year solar cycle as well as a 27-day variation with solar rotation. The variation of the shape of the solar Lyman-alpha line profile with solar activity is, on the other hand, the subject of some controversy. Reconstructions of direct solar observations indicate that the level of the selfreversed center of the line varies with a larger amplitude than does the integrated line flux.  However, indirect analysis from observations of the interstellar medium are consistent with little or no variation of the ratio of the line-center to the integrated flux with solar activity. We propose here to observe the solar Lyman-alpha profile using the small aperture (and high spectral resolution mode) of IUE as reflected from the Moon. Four observations would be requested approximately 27 days in advance so that two line profiles each could be obtained at relatively active and quite solar conditions. Such information is not only important for understanding the formation of the H line-profile in the atmosphere of the sun, but also for the interpretation of Lyman-alpha observations of the earth's H geocorona, planetary and cometary hydrogen, and the interstellar wind.|Y

SPBMT|Spectrophotometry of Planets, Satellites and Asteroids|Martin G.|Tomasko|Arizona|We propose to make IUE observations of both planets with atmospheres and of asteroids during the second block of scheduled IUE observing time. The planetary observations serve to identify minor gaseous constituents and constrain the vertical distribution of condensable components such as ammonia. In addition, observations from the center of the disk to the limb constrain the optical properties and vertical distribution of atmospheric aerosols.  The observations of the asteroids in the ultraviolet will show the broad absorption feature centered near 0.23 microns due to Fe2+ and similar transition metal ions. Ground-based studies of the longwavelength tail of this feature in the blue have proved very useful for classification of the asteroids into a few basic types. The observations down to the bottom of this band are expected to contribute to an important increase in our understanding of asteroid minerology.|Y

We request new observations of Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus with both cameras, attempting spatial resolution for the former two. We further propose to reobserve Io to better define its probable transient environment, and to reobserve Titan in support of the Voyager encounter. A very important part of this proposal is the systematic observations of G stars to aid in analysis of planetary data and for their intrinsic interest.|Y

A series of exposures on Uranus emphasizing short wavelength emissions are also proposed as support for the Voyager program.|Y
SPDJC|Solar System Investigations with the IUE Satellite|John J.|Caldwell|Stony Brook|We propose to make the following double-shift observations, to be begun at VILSPA and read down at Goddard: Jupiter center of disk, LWR and SWP, both at high spectral resolution; Titan, Uranus and Neptune, all SWP, low resolution; and Neptune LWR low resolution. This will total 12 shifts (6 NASA, 6 European). We further propose to make spatially resolved observations of Jupiter and Saturn at low resolution during the 6 NASA second shifts following the sequences listed above. Finally, as an integral part of our program, we propose calibration observations of two types: i) low resolution observations of G stars to define the continuum albedos of the planets (5 shifts) and ii) high resolution observations (LWR) of Mars to simulate a high resolution Solar spectrum, at nearly the same time as the Jupiter LWR high resolution work (I shift), The grand total is 18 NASA shifts (9 first, 9 second). These observations will be part of our continuing program to investigate known and suspected minor constituents in the atmospheres of these objects, including ammonia (NH3), methane (CH4 ), acetylene (C2H2), phosphine (PH3) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S).  They are essential to understanding the photochemistry and other properties of the stratospheres of the giant planets.|Y
SPEHM|IUE Study of Emissions from Saturn and Uranus|H. Warren|Moos|Johns Hopkins University|Observations of Ly-alpha emission from Saturn and Uranus are proposed.

The Uranus observations will determine the Ly-alpha brightness, leading to determinations of the atomic hydrogen column density and the eddy diffusion coefficient.|Y
SPEJC|Solar System Investigations with the IUE|John J.|Caldwell|Stony Brook|We propose to improve the observations of Uranus and Neptune below 2000 A with double-shift (European and US 1) 15 hour exposures, to quantify the effects of C2H2 (acetylene) absorption and thereby provide insight to the chemistry of their stratospheres. In addition, for Uranus, we will look for possible seasonal variations in its far ultraviolet albedo. We further propose to observe the equatorial limb of Jupiter, to clarify the vertical distribution of NH3 (ammonia), C2H2, and other absorbers, in its stratosphere. We also propose to obtain an 8 hour SWP high dispersion exposure of Saturn to complete our previous set, and we will observe the opening rings of Saturn for clues of their composition. We request comet occultation observations as "targets of opportunity", and we request time to observe Solar-like stars, both as calibrators for our albedo calculations and for their intrinsic interest.|Y
SPEJT|High Spatial Resolution IUE Observations of Jupiter & Saturn|John T.|Trauger|Cal Tech|We propose to continue our high spectral resolution study of molecular species associated with specific Jovian cloud features as a probe of Jovian photochemistry and atmospheric dynamics. Visible and near UV atmospheric features are associated with local variations in composition, temperature. and vertical eddy diffusion rates. In addition we propose to partially map (at low spectral resolution) Jupiter and Saturn to measure the spatial variation in the ultraviolet albedo extending the range covered by the Voyager 2 photopolarimeter. This data can be inverted to obtain information on the spatial distribution of the chemical composition of the upper atmosphere and the variation in the nature and distribution of the high-altitude haze.|Y
SPEMA|Dusty, Distant Comets|Michael F.|A'Hearn|Maryland|Comets Bowell (1980b) and Elias (1981c) provide a unique opportunity to study bright. active comets at large heliocentric distances. Bowell has been well observed optically since discovery and shows a continuous spectrum in the optical. Filter photometry suggests the presence of OH emission but there are no confirming spectra. Comet Elias has been in the southern sky since discovery and we are not aware of any ground based observations. We propose to obtain coordinated spectrophotometry In the ultraviolet from IUE, in the optical from Cerro Tololo and U. of Hawaii, and In the infrared from NASA's IRTF In Hawaii. We will determine the reflection spectrum of the grains, nearly free of emission lines, from the ultraviolet to the infrared. We will measure the OH and H emission and search for the expected emissions of either CO+ or C02+. We will look for spatial variations In the spectra of the solid particles and for variations in the backscattering function which should be very wavelength dependent.|Y
SPFCB|Observations of H LY Alpha Emission from Neptune|C. Stuart|Bowyer|UC Berkeley|We propose to perform a series of integrations with the SWP camera under low dispersion to attempt to detect the H Ly-alpha emission from Neptune by spatially resolving it from the background Ly-alpha emission which uniformly fills the large entrance aperture. We have used this technique on four days over the current observing season to successfully measure a disc-averaged brightness of ~ 400-800 Rayleighs from Uranus: this emission has been interpreted as being auroral in nature, giving the first direct evidence of charged particle acceleration and therefore a magnetic field on Uranus. Two results from the analysis of these Uranus data lead us to believe that H Ly-alpha emission may be detectable from Neptune. First, the emission from Uranus turned out to be 4-8 times brighter than had been expected by extrapolation from Jupiter and Saturn. Second, the method of detection turned out to be more sensitive than predicted. In two US 2 shifts we estimate that a minimum planetary emission of 50-100 R would have been detected from Uranus. We are proposing for two US 2 shifts to see if the emission is detectable, and an additional two US 2 shifts to obtain better signal to noise in the measurement and/or to look for variability in the emission.|Y
SPFHM|Study of Ultraviolet Emissions from Saturn, Uranus and Neptune|H. Warren|Moos|Johns Hopkins University|Observations of the HI Ly-alpha emission from Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are proposed. Also the H2 Lyman- and Werner-band emissions from the Saturnian aurora will be observed and will be searched for in the case of Uranus. The Saturnian and Uranian observations will help to determine the frequency of occurrences of bursts of Ly-alpha signals, believed to be auroral in nature. The dependence of these emissions on solar wind parameters and, in the case of Saturn, on the longitude of the observation, will be studied. The Neptune observations will determine the Ly-alpha brightness, leading to determinations of the atomic hydrogen column density and the eddy diffusion coefficient.|Y

Uranus and Neptune Below 2000 Angstroms|John J.|Caldwell|Stony Brook|Proposed double shift observations of Uranus and Neptune with the large aperture of the SWP will be made to attempt verification of a molecular H2 aurora on Uranus (tentatively found by us after others discovered the H aurora) and to search for an H2 aurora on Neptune. The same data will also be used to improve existing signal to noise longward of 1650 A, in the region of reflected sunlight, to verify previous indications of differing amounts of absorption between the two planets.|Y
SPFRN|UV Spectrophotometry of the Galilean Satellites, Saturnian Satellites & Selected Asteroids|Robert M.|Nelson|JPL|We propose a series of ultraviolet spectral observations of solid surfaces of selected solar system objects, specifically the Galilean satellites of Jupiter, several atmosphereless satellites of Saturn, and the asteroids, 5 Astraea, 18 Melpomene, 532 Herculina, 68 Leto, 31 Euphmsyne, 80 Sappho, 3 Juno, and 39 Laetitia. Historically such spectral observations have allowed for the Identification of spectrally active solid state materials on planetary surfaces. Furthermore, because the rotational properties are known for all the objects proposed for study, this technique will provide a longitude map of such materials on the objects' surfaces. The study of asteroid surface mineralogy is an important method of constraining solar system formation models. The asteroid spectra we have previously acquired with IUE have created unique subdivisions within the existent asteroid types. The new spectra will provide more sophisticated mineralogical characterizations of asteroid surface materials. Our other accomplishments with IUE include mapping of the distribution of condensed S02 on Io, identification of a longitudinal asymmetry on Europa associated with magnetospheric particle bombardment of the surface, and establishing the ultraviolet geometric albedo variation as a function of longitude for all the Galilean satellites. Because Io is the most volcanically active body In the solar system, and short tern variations in selected regions of the Jovian magnetosphere are known to occur, it is important to periodically check for temporal variations in the spectra of the Galilean satellites that may be due to variations n Io tectonic/volcanic activity, or magnetosphere changes. These proposed UV observations are critical to the design and operation of several instruments on Project Galileo, NASA's Jupiter Orbiter and Probe Mission. Spectra of Iapetus, Rhea and Dione have been acquired during the previous year; however, only at orbital locations near elongation. In addition, the dark leading face of Iapetus has not been well characterized because the time period where optimum detection of the dark material occurs only lasts about one-half day and past scheduling has not permitted data acquisition In this time-window. We wish to carefully arrange the observations to permit this critical measurement, as well as acquiring a few other orbital phase angles for Dione and Rhea. The Voyager spacecraft made a few broad-band measurements at 260 nm but IUE data are needed to fix the low solar phase angle data. These data will form the basis of a UV spectral geometric albedo set for these satellites.|Y
SPGHM|Study of Ultraviolet Emissions Induced by the Magnetospheres of Saturn and Uranus|H. Warren|Moos|Johns Hopkins University|A series of IUE-spectra are required to better understand auroral processes on on Saturn and Uranus. Intense variable Ly-alpha emissions have been observed from both planets. In the case of Uranus the presence of these emissions has been used as evidence for aurorae and hence a magnetic field. The three outer planets with auroral emissions observable by IUE (Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus) have roughly similar atmospheres but very different magnetospheres. Thus it is possible to use the IUE spectra in comparative studies of the three magnetospheres. The primary observational goals of this program will be 1. the longitudinal variation of the Saturnian aurorae, 2. the monitoring of Saturnian and Uranian aurorae with solar activity at a time when it is decreasing and 3. the obtaining of better H2 emission spectra for the Saturnian aurorae.|Y
SPGMA|Periodic Comets|Michael|A'Hearn|University of Maryland|We propose to obtain spectra of periodic Comets Encke, Tsuchinshan 1, and Tuttle-Giacobini-Kresak (T-G-K).

We propose to look for chemical anomalies, in T-G-K, a comet known to exhibit unusual outbursts. We propose one survey observation of Tsuchinshan 1.|Y
SPGRN|UV Spectrophotometry of the Galilean Satellites, Saturnian Satellites & Selected Asteroids|Robert M.|Nelson|JPL|We propose a series of ultraviolet spectral observations of solid surfaces of selected solar system objects, specifically the Galilean satellites of Jupiter, several atmosphereless satellites of Saturn, and selected asteroids. Such spectral observations of planetary satellites have allowed for the identification of spectrally active solid state materials on planetary satellite surfaces. Furthermore, because the rotational properties are known for all the satellites proposed for study, this technique has allowed us to begin production of a longitude map of such materials on the objects' surfaces. The asteroid spectra we have previously acquired with IUE have created unique subdivisions within the existent asteroid types. Because Io is the most volcanically active body in the solar system, and short term variations in selected regions of the Jovian magnetosphere are known to occur, it is important to take spectra regularly at large, solar phase angles to check for temporal variations in the spectra. We propose an additional set of Galilean satellite observations at low solar phase angle in order to study the opposition brightness surge of these objects in the UV. The magnitude of this surge combined with the UV albedo at large solar phase angle provide additional information regarding the surface texture of the satellites. These proposed UV observations are critical to the sequence design of several instruments on Project Galileo, NASA's Jupiter Orbiter and Probe Mission. Spectra of Iapetus, Rhea and Dione have been acquired during the previous two years; however, only at orbital locations near elongation. The dark leading face of Iapetus has not been well characterized because the time period where optimum detection of the dark material occurs only lasts about one-half day and past scheduling has not permitted data acquisition in this time-window. We wish to carefully arrange the observations to permit this critical measurement, as well as acquiring a few other orbital phase angles for Dione and Rhea. The Voyager spacecraft made a few broad-band measurements at 260 nm but IUE data are needed to fix the low solar phase angle data.|Y
SPHPF|IUE Observations of Comets as Targets of Opportunity|Paul D.|Feldman|Johns Hopkins University|The IUE spectrographs will be used to obtain ultraviolet observations of any suitable comet other than Halley or Giacobini-Zinner that may appear in the year beginning 1 April 1985. A number of problems will be addressed by these data relating to the composition of the nucleus, the dynamics of the gas outflow and the photochemistry of the neutral and ionized gas in the coma. In particular, IUE observations of additional comets are needed to further study the systematics of the relative dust and gas production rates as a functions of heliocentric distance.|Y
SPIJN|UV Geometric Albedos of Uranus and Neptune|John S.|Neff|Iowa|The proposed investigation is part of a program of spectrophotometry of planets and satellites with thick atmospheres that has been in progress for a number of years. The motivation for this program is to obtain highprecision absolute spectrophotometry, on at least an annual basis, of the whole disk of the planet or satellite for detailed comparison of observed geometric albedo spectra with computed spectra from model atmospheres. It is important to cover as wide a range of wavelength as possible with the highest practical spectral resolution in order to adequately constrain the many parameters used in the models. It is also very important to investigate any temporal changes in the observed spectrum of these objects since all current models are time independent. The proposed investigation will use archived data and new measurements to extend existing and future ground-based optical and infrared measurements into the ultraviolet.|Y
SPIJW|Ongoing Observations of Jupiter and Saturn|J. H.|Waite|NASA/GSFC|We propose to carry out a continued program of observation of Jupiter and Saturn with two major scientific objectives: (1) the study of the solar cycle variation of the Saturn Lyman-alpha emission and (2) a continuation of the study of Jovian aurora with emphasis on the spatial asymmetry of the north and south polar caps.  Both the Jupiter and Saturn observations will be carried out using the SWP camera under low dispersion.  Results will be compared to observations of similar features at Jupiter and Saturn observed last year by these same investigators under the IUE Guest Observer Program.  The Jovian auroral observations will also be compared to theoretical predictions of expected auroral UV emissions from heavy ion precipitation which have just been completed by Horanyi, Cravens, and Waite [1985].|Y
SPJJW|Particle Induced UV Emissions at the Outer Planets|J. H.|Waite|NASA/GSFC|We propose to carry out a continued program of observation of Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus with two major scientific objectives: (1) the study of the solar cycle variation of the outer planets' Lyman-alpha emission, and (2) the study of the relative role of ion and electron precipitation in the Jovian aurora as a function of S III longitude. All observations will be carried out using the SWP camera under low dispersion. Results will be compared to observations of similar features at Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus observed in previous years by these same investigators under the IUE Guest Observer Program. The Jovian auroral observations will also be compared to theoretical predictions of expected auroral UV emissions from heavy ion precipitation [Horanyi et al., 1986].|Y
SPJMA|Periodic Comets: Encke and Borrelly|Michael F.|A'Hearn|Maryland|We propose to measure the variation in production rate of H20 as a function of heliocentric distance for comet Encke as it recedes from the Sun in its 1987 apparition. These data will allow us to refine existing models which indicate that the variation in production rate is due to the orientation of the comet's rotation axis with respect to the sun. The periodic monitoring of the FES counts will enable us the watch for outburst of the comet and determine whether or not the OH production rate is in phase with other molecular emissions, particularly CN and C2. This information will constrain production mechanisms. We also propose to observe Comet P/Borrelly as it reaches perihelion to look for outbursts in this comet.|Y
SPJRW|A Search for Nitriles in the Stratosphere of Titan|Richard|Wagener|Applied Research Corp.|The Voyager flyby of Titan has established N2 as the major constituent of the atmosphere, with a methane admixture of about 3% and thirteen additional trace constituents--mostly hydrocarbons. Laboratory experiments on organic synthesis in N2-CH4H2 gas mixtures have shown that the formation of nitriles is favored for low H2 mixing ratios, which is the case for Titan's atmosphere. Recently measured UV cross sections for CH3-C = C-CN (2-butymenitrile), which is one of the nitriles obtained in the synthesis experiments, show that the geometric albedo of Titan would be noticeably decreased at 240 nm by a mixing ratio of 2-butynenitrile of only 10-9 above the 15 mbar level. This is about two orders of magnitude below current infrared upper limits for the mixing ratio. However, the best previous IUE spectrum of Titan (8 hours with the small aperture) is near the noise level at 240 nm. We propose to observe Titan in the large aperture (a two-fold increase in transmission) with collaborative double-shift observations of up to 16 hours. This will provide an excellent chance for detecting 2butynenitrile, and even a non-detection would represent a major improvement in the upper limit. We therefore expect to determine significantly stronger constraints on the atmospheric chemistry by these new observations.|Y
SPKHM|Emissions from Saturn and Uranus|H. Warren|Moos|Johns Hopkins university|Although the outer planets have similar (but not identical atmospheres, their magnetospheres and probably upper atmospheric heating processes are quite different. The ultraviolet emission spectra display signatures of the excitation processes which can be used to understand these differences. The research proposed here will obtain new spectra of Saturn and Uranus for the following purposes: (1) to search for the longitudinal dependence of the Saturnian auroral emissions and to compare the location of the current emission peak to that of the Voyager encounter by using a new technique, the variation of the atomic hydrogen Lyman alpha emission, rather than the molecular hydrogen emission utilized in the past; (2) to examine with the set of observations obtained for (1), the short- and long-term variations (in the excitation process) by measurements of the equatorial Lyman-alpha airglow; (3) to measure the auroral and equatorial emissions at a time when the solar wind impinging on Saturn can also be measured with other spacecraft, serving as a baseline for a Target of Opportunity proposal to measure the effects of large solar wind disturbances; (4) to continue the measurements of the variable Uranian Lyman-alpha emissions, which were first detected by IUE in 1982 and shown by Voyager to be due to a poorly understood combination of excitation processes and auroral activity.|Y
SPKJC|Doppler Imaging of Planetary Aurorae|John T.|Clarke|University of Michigan|We propose to study the detailed auroral processes on Jupiter and Saturn by measuring the profile of the H Ly-alpha line, similar to the early study that first detected proton precipitation in the earth's aurora. The contribution of protons to earth's aurora is easily observed through a pronounced broadening of the H lines by charge exchange of the fast protons, allowing line profile measurements to be inverted to yield the energy spectrum of the protons. We have already determined in a test exposure that the KeV protons observed in the earth's aurora were not present on Jupiter at one time, although the H Ly-alpha line did appear broadened by particle motions of tens of eV. We propose to follow up on this work with accurate measurement of these lower energy currents (both magnitude and direction with respect  to the field lines) in the Jupiter auroral tine profile using the small aperture at high dispersion, and to attempt the best measurement of Saturn's auroral line profile at high dispersion to detect any proton motions. Since Saturn's magnetosphere is considered to he much more earth-like than Jupiter's, with the auroral zones at high latitudes connected to magnetotail (solar wind proton) field lines, we expect a better chance of detecting earth-like KeV proton precipitation. Either the presence or absence of fast protons in the aurora will be an interesting result, and the comparison of the two very different magnetospheres will form an interesting contrast to the earth.|Y
SPKTS|Ultraviolet Observations of Pluto|Thomas E.|Skinner|Colorado - CASA|Ground-based observations of Pluto have established the presence of methane on the planet's surface, and Pluto is also thought to have a tenuous methane atmosphere. In addition, an argument for the presence of N2 on Pluto can be developed based on cosmological abundance arguments and by analogy with the Saturnian satellite Titan, which has a thick N2 atmosphere. The presence of N2 on Pluto would result in a significant atmosphere around the planet, since the vapor pressure (and hence the abundance) of N2 at temperatures representative of Pluto's thermal regime exceeds that of CH4 by a factor of almost 1000. A contiguous Vislpa-US1 shift is requested in order to search for Rayleigh scattering in the Pluto atmosphere. The failure of ground-based searches to detect a Rayleigh scattering "UV upturn" in spectra of Pluto's atmosphere can be explained by the large N2 columns (requiring correspondingly high surface temperatures) necessary to produce an observable effect above ~ 3200 AL. Moreover, the combination of N2 absorption in the Earth's atmosphere and the faintness of Pluto to visual and infrared spectroscopy precludes the spectroscopic detection of N2 absorption features from the ground. At the cold temperatures present on Pluto's surface, an increase in the albedo expected from Rayleigh scattering below 3200 A presents us with a valuable diagnostic for determining the presence or absence of a thick N2 atmosphere on Pluto. Either result provides important information relevant to the formation history of Pluto, and the proposed IUE observations will establish an important reference point for future HST monitoring of Pluto's temporal behavior.|Y
SPLSS|IUE Observations of Pluto's Surface and Extended Atmosphere|S. Alan|Stern|Colorado LASP|In June 1987 and July 1988, the first successful UV observations of Pluto were conducted by IUE (Stern, et al. 1989). In these observations, four exposures were made, the longest two of which (LWP11403, LWP13622) had sufficient S/N to permit extensive analysis. These observations allowed us to determine Pluto's geometric albedo in the region 2600-3100 A. It was found that Pluto (a) is UV bright, (b) possesses a "blue" albedo slope (i.e., becomes progressively brighter into the ultraviolet), and (c) is well separated from the major satellite groups in a UV vs. UV/IR color diagram. These observations provided important constraints on Pluto's surface properties and have demonstrated the importance of UV observations of Pluto.  Based on the success of the initial observations described above, we propose to extend the IUE observations of Pluto in two respects. First, we propose to make an observation of Pluto's surface reflectance properties at a second longitude (roughly opposite the location of exposure LWP13622; near the lightcurve maximum), with the objective to search for hemispheric differences in the level and shape of the reflectance curve. We note that this LWP exposure will also allow us to extend the reflectance curve to 2500A. Secondly, we propose to search for the H Ly-alpha corona which is predicted to surround Pluto's extended atmosphere (Hubbard, et al. 1988). The discovery and study of such a corona would provide key constraints on the photochemistry and loss processes acting in Pluto's atmosphere.  The results of these proposed experiments relate directly to comparative studies of the Titan, Triton, Pluto triad, and will lay important groundwork for proposed HST studies of Pluto.|Y
SPQEG|The Sun in Time: An IUE Investigation of Solar Proxies of Different Ages|Edward|Guinan|Villanova University|Continuing IUE observations are a crucial constituent of a program in which we examine the long-term characteristics of the magnetic activity in a number of single solar-like stars which have been selected as proxies for the Sun at ages from 70 Myr to 9 Gyr. The IUE archives contain long-term UV  observations of the majority of the selected targets, and long-term optical photometry is also available for most. The primary aim is to employ the archival IUE material together with new IUE observations in order to search for the presence of activity cycles to further an understanding of the evolution of the solar activity cycle. In addition, we plan coordinated IUE-EUVE observations of two of the more active targets: HD 129333 and kappa Ceti. This will permit a complete volume emission measure analysis to be obtained with a temperature range of T = 10^4 K - 10^7 K. Four close analogs of the present Sun also are included in an attempt to determine the extent to which the Sun is typical of stars of its age and spectral type. Our IUE observations of one of these stars, HD 44594 (known as the solar twin), reveal that its Mg II emission varies by about 20-30% over a few years. We shall also obtain quantitative estimates of the line emission and continuum UV flux of the Sun in time, using the target stars as proxies. The UV flux of the young Sun was an important factor in the evolution of planetary atmospheres, and possibly in the origin and evolution of life on Earth.|Y
SPREG|An IUE Investigation of Solar Proxies of Different Ages|Edward F.|Guinan|Villanova University|Continued IUE observations are crucial to a program to examine the magnetic activity of the Sun throughout its mainsequence life-time using solar-type stars selected as proxies for the Sun at different ages. The main aim is to identify activity cycles and to determine how their nature depends on age. The youngest (tau ~ 70 Myr) and most active target is HD129333, a rapidly rotating (P = 2.7d) analog of the ZAMS Sun that show strong evidence for an activity cycle of ~12 years. The other stars span ages from 300 Myr to 9.5 Gyr, representing the Sun up to the end of its mainsequence lifetime. The IUE observations will be supported by simultaneous UBVRI photometry, and by ROSATand VLA observations as far as possible. We are also requesting time for intensive IUE observations of HD129333 over its rotational cycle to verify the phase-dependence of its chromospheric and TR line-emission suggested by our previous IUE observations and that may also be present in ROSAT and VLA observations. The proposed observations of this group of stars will permit the most detailed examination so far of solar magnetic activity from photosphere to corona throughout the Sun's lifetime.|Y

SRHLW|MGII Emission from Mira Variables|Lee Anne|Willson|Iowa State|We propose to obtain 4-6 observations each of the brightest normal M-Type Mira variables around their pulsational cycles, plus additional observations of the brightest S-Type, carbon star and binary Miras. The normal Mira spectra will be used (1) to probe the radiative cooling in post-shock regions of the atmosphere as a function of phase, and (2) for comparison with the binary Miras and the related symbiotic systems. This analysis is expected to yield useful information on the density structure of these highly extended atmospheres. The observations of the Mira-containing binaries will be used to (a) study the effects of interaction due to the Mira wind and (b) for comparison with the more dramatically active Mira-containing symbiotics, for which there are already a large number of IUE observations.|Y
SRJEB|Atmospheric Structure, Shocks and Mass Loss in RV Tauri Variables|Edward W.|Brugel|Colorado - CASA|RV Tauri variables are a distinct and unique class of pulsationally unstable stars. Their behavior is characterized by alternating deep and shallow minima, and they tend to show spectral variations indicative of metal poor supergiants (II-Ib, Ia) of type F, G, and K. Periods are typically 30-150^d, with the majority 50-100^d. The period-luminosity diagram indicates that the RV Tau's fall along a grand sequence sandwiched between the shorter period W Vir stars and the longer period semi-regular and Mira variables.  Also, RV Tau variables often exhibit evidence for mass loss. The Balmer lines are seen in emission, while line doubling and weak metallic-line emission provide evidence for moving atmospheric layers and shock waves similar to Mira variables. The existence of large amounts of circumstellar material implies that that mass loss is fundamental to RV Tau behavior.  We propose to obtain LWP low dispersion observations for a small sample of RV Tau stars. Of extreme importance is obtaining good phase coverage during a single cycle for each object. The variability of Mg II emission will be monitored, as well as the atmospheric temperature via uv metallic-line absorption (Fe II and Mn II). Simultaneous optical spectroscopic observations will be obtained with the University of Wisconsin 36" telescope. When combined, the uv and optical data provide sufficient information to determine the temperature, gravity, and metallicity at each phase point.  By observing MgII throughout the cycle it should be possible to determine the shock luminosity and duration, and the density in the upper atmosphere of these RV Tau stars. These data also provide a mechanism for probing the radiative cooling in post-shock regions of the atmosphere and ultimately the mass loss process. Theoretical model calculations (Bowen 1987) indicate that pulsation is an underlying cause of enhanced mass loss in the region of the H-R diagram occupied by pulsationally unstable stars (e.g. RV Tau and Mira variables).  To summarize, the goals of this proposal are to (1) monitor the atmospheric temperature at various phases via the uv metallic absorption lines; (2) investigate the propagation of atmospheric shocks and induced mass loss from the outer atmosphere of RV Tau stars through monitoring the MgII emission versus phase; and (3) combine uv and optical data to provide a spectroscopically unambiguous determination of the temperature, gravity and metallicity during a single cycle.|Y
SRJRF|Variations in the Absorption Lines Associated with SN 1006|Robert A.|Fesen|Colorado - CASA|Analysis of 8th year IUE data for a faint sdOB star situated behind the young and suspected Type I supernova remnant of AD 1006 together with a careful re-analysis of earlier IUE spectra (Wu et al. 1983) confirm the presence of several very strong and definitely non-stellar absorption lines in this star's UV spectrum (Fesen, Wu, Leventhal, and Hamilton 1986). Exceedingly broad and strong absorption features at 2370 and 2600 A agree well with the relative strengths and wavelengths of the Fe II 2343, 2382, and 2599 A resonance lines and indicate an Fe II mass of about 0.1 solar mass. Other strong absorption features at 1282, 1331, and 1420 A are identified as redshifted S II (1259, 1254), O I (1302), and Si IV (1393, 1402) respectively with radial velocities of 5000 to 6700 km s^-1.  The UV spectra of this sdOB star has provided us with an exciting and invaluable observational probe of the elemental composition and dynamical properties of a young Type I supernova remnant via the line-of-sight interception of the remnant's outer ejecta knots and expanding central iron core. The elements, ionization, and velocities implied by these absorption lines are in good agreement with both optical spectral features seen in Type I SN as well as detailed model calculations predicting the final explosive nucleosynthesis production and expansion velocities.  Importantly however, some absorption line variations are seen between the 1982/83 and 1986 IUE spectra. Indeed, if the 1282, 1331, and 1420 A features are really due to knots of ejecta with dimensions similar to those of other remnants (i.e., 0.01 pc), these features cannot persist or remain unchanged over time scales greater than a few years. In order to understand fully the nature of the remnant's ejecta, we propose to monitor these changes in these absorption features over the next two IUE observing seasons (1987/88 and 1988/89). The exposure times are well known with the data reduction and analysis already established and straightforward. Because each of these lines is interpreted as due to a different ion, substantial changes seen in any of the individual features can help provide unequivocal line identifications. Moreover, such line changes will also yield ejecta size and filling factor estimates, as well as providing invaluable up-to-date spectral information vital for planned HST observation s.|Y
SRJWB|O-Rich Supernova Remnants in the LMC|William P.|Blair|Johns Hopkins|We wish to obtain long, collaborative SWP and LWP large aperture spectra of two young, oxygen-rich supernova remnants in the Large Magellanic Cloud. These data will be used in conjunction with theoretical calculations to (1) derive the physical conditions of the emitting gas in each object, (2) find the abundances of carbon and silicon relative to oxygen, and (3) estimate the mass of the precursor stars that created these remnants. Although both are O-rich, the two objects show quite different optical spectra and the UV data will provide important constraints for nucleosynthesis theories in massive stars.|Y
SRLJE|Chromospheric Variability in M Giants|Joel A.|Eaton|Indiana University|For the past two years, we have been studying the constancy of chromospheric emission in M-giant semi-regular variables, finding a wide range of variability. In some stars, the chromospheric luminosity is roughly constant, while in others it changes abruptly by factors of order 5. Two of the stars observed had changes that might be associated with shock heating as in Mira variables. However, variations in Mg II emission occur more frequently than do the larger changes in the visual brightness. To ellucidate the cause of these variations, we propose obtaining further observations of these stars to determine whether changes in chromospheric emission really are associated with pulsations or are due to other changes in the chromosphere. We plan to observe (1) several SRb variables over a full "period" at low dispersion to see if pulsationally driven shock waves may be causing the changes in chromospheric heating already observed and (2) one or two somewhat warmer, more nearly constant M giants at high dispersion to see how changes in emission line profiles and relative intensities change with the overall level of chromospheric emission.|Y
SRLPJ|Cycle-Dependent Studies of Semi-Regular Giant Stars|Philip G.|Judge|Colorado - JILA|We propose to monitor the chromospheres and winds of the semi-regular giants Rho Per (M4 II-III, P ~ 50 days) and g Her (M6 III, P ~ 90 days) as a function of their cyclic photospheric variability using LWP observations coordinated with ground based spectroscopy and photometry.  We have recently studied a sample of 42 stars covering various phases of evolution on the redand asymptoticgiant branches. We have discovered that as a star evolves from a photometrically "constant" early M stax to a semi-regular (SRb) stax near spectral type M5 III, important changes in the response of the outer atmosphere to the photospheric mechanical energy generation occur. The energy fluxes are dominated in the early phases by chromospheric heating and radiative losses, and by mass loss in the later phases.  "Non-variable" and semi-regular K and M stars lose mass by a currently unidentified process. The present proposal aims to follow the response of the chromosphere and wind, via the emission and absorption components in the Mg II and Ca II resonance lines, to the underlying photospheric variability in SRb-type M stars. In this way we can test whether global photospheric variability on a long timescale (>= weeks, i.e. > acoustic cutoff period) is responsible for the enhanced massloss and dust formation in non-Mira stars later than M5 and whether the energy generated by these pulsations is related to the (observationally-inferred) chromospheric heating. Previous monitoring studies with IUE of SRb stars reveal variability but they have neither adequate phase coverage nor the ground-based support required for our study.  Our study will help to provide a link between the outer atmospheres of the "non-variable" and Mira phases of stellar evolution: current theory indicates that the Miras (P > 150 days, DeltaV > 2.5 mag.) lose substantial mass because of the propagation and decay of global acoustic shocks, accompanied by dust formation, generated by the regular photospheric pulsations. Our recent study and theoretical work suggest that similar processes may be occuring in the shorterperiod, smaller amplitude SRb stars. The proposed IUE observations will help to clarify the relation of stellar winds and chromospheres to the variability properties of stars evolving up the giant branches.|Y
SRLRF|An Ultraviolet Study of S Andromedae|Robert A.|Fesen|Colorado - CASA|We have discovered the long sought after remnant of the historical supernova (SN) which occurred in 1885 in the nuclear bulge of M31 (Fesen, Hamilton, and Walter 1988). The remnant is detected optically as a dark spot of Fe I absorption at precisely the known position of the SN event. SN 1885, commonly known as S Andromedae, was spectroscopically a Type I SN, although its light curve was peculiarly fast compared to most Type I SNe. Our detection of strong, broad Fe I absorption is consistent with a Type I classification.  Absorption line observations offer a particularly powerful way of observing a young supernova remnant, since from observed absorption line profiles it is possible in principle to determine directly density and composition as a function of radius in the freely expanding supernova ejecta. S And's youth and favorable situation in the bulge of M31 make it singularly well placed for absorption line observations.  Our model calculations indicate that the inner iron-rich parts of the ejecta of SN 1885 should be mainly Fe I, while the outer parts should be mainly Fe II, photoionized by light from the bulge of M31. UV observations are essential to determine the quantity and velocity extent of the Fe II, and to detect other elements such as C, O, Si, and S. The bulge of M31 is bright enough in the UV to provide a background source observable with IUE. Because the remnant of SN 1885 is expected to evolve appreciably on a ten year timescale, it is important to establish a first epoch UV observation at the earnest opportunity.  We propose to obtain low-dispersion IUE spectra of S And. The observations will: (a) establish the structure and extent of the highest velocity iron ejecta; (b) determine the quantity and distribution with velocity of other elements such as C, O, Si, and S; (c) permit an estimate of the mass of the ejecta; and (d) provide a first epoch reference observation for comparison to future observations.|Y
SRNJE|Chromospheric Structure and Heating in Semiregular Variables|Joel A.|Eaton|Tennessee State University|For which M giants is pulsational chromospheric heating the dominant heating mechanism? Magnetic fields seem to be the source in the warmer stars with denser, hotter chromospheres. However, in a wide range of stars, acoustic waves seem to contribute a basal heating, and in the coolest giants, pulsations probably dominate chromospheric heating. We have obtained three-seasons worth of Mg II fluxes for three cool semiregular variable M giants, and these data suggest pulsationally driven waves dominate the heating in early to middle M giants as well. Such observations also have given us another means of estimating the geometric extent and location of the chromosphere. We propose to apply this technique-comparing the chromospheric emission flux with visual (~bolometric) brightnessto a wider range of such stars so as to answer fully the questions: 1) Is pulsational heating the dominant mechanism in M giants? 2) Is the long-term overall luminosity important in determining the level of chromospheric emission? and 3) How does the geometry of the chromosphere differ from star to star in this range?|Y
SRNPJ|The Mira/Semi-Regular Connection II|Philip G.|Judge|Colorado - CASA|We propose to extend the present 1 year program LGMPJ, "the Mira/Semi-Regular Connection" for an extra year. The purpose is to obtain a better understanding of mass-loss mechanisms by studying the behavior of the Mg II h and k line fluxes in a more complete sample of pulsating stars. In program LGMPJ, the allotted observing time was insufficient to permit more than a preliminary study of 3 stars. Important classes of stars of various infrared and variability properties have therefore remained unstudied.  The Mg II line fluxes are sensitive indicators of non-radiative processes occuring in layers of giants where energy and momentum is imparted to the wind. We will compare our findings with our earlier IUE studies of Miras and "non-dusty" semi-regulars. Using the IRAS database and other constraints, we will learn about the nature of the mass-loss process from cool giants, and obtain strong constraints on models of the evolution of the circumstellar envelopes, and hence of stellar evolution on the AGB.|Y

SRPYC|Interstellar Absorption Lines as Diagnositcs for Hidden Supernova Remnants|You-Hua|Chu|U Illinois|How can supernova remnants (SNRs) hidden within the low density interiors of superbubbles be detected? We have observed excess X-ray emission from superbubbles in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) that we believe is produced by hidden SNRs hitting the dense superbubble shells.  We now need an independent method to confirm this suggestion. UV absorption lines from the highly-ionized, shocked gas might be observable in the spectra of stars lying behind the SNR shock. We have surveyed the IUE archives for suitable targets, and find that X-ray bright superbubbles show a large velocity offset between high ions and low ions. Will this provide our desired diagnostic? We have been awarded ROSAT time to extend our study by observing three superbubbles, N11, N44, and N144. Here we propose to observe stars within these superbubbles to study the physical mechanism causing the velocity offset and to confirm the existence of hidden SNRs in X-ray bright superbubbles.|Y
SRRMD|Saturn Auroral and Dayglow H2 Emissions|Matthew T.|DeLand|Hughes - STX|UV dayglow and auroral emissions have provided a wealth of information about Saturn during the past two decades. In addition to defining the composition and structure of the upper atmosphere, measurements of Saturn's UV emissions have also helped to interpret the energetic environment which generates these emissions. The majority of these data, including an unparalleled 14-year continuous record, have come from IUE observations, which continue to provide vital information even during the era of Hubble Space Telescope operations. Our proposed research program requests new IUE observations in the 18th episode to help understand the mechanisms by which ultraviolet H2 emissions from Saturn are created. A recent study of Jovian H2 emissions showed a strong correlation with solar UV variations, but required a mechanism beyond resonant scattering to explain the observations. The observations of Saturn we propose are important to obtaining a wide range of solar UV activity conditions for interpreting Saturnian H2 emissions in a similar framework. We intend to use the results of 18th episode IUE observations to supplement an ongoing research program using archival IUE images. Finally, our proposed research program will enhance the available Saturn database for the forthcoming Cassini mission.|Y

SSBDM|Spectral Reflectances of the Galilean Satellites of Jupiter|Dennis L.|Matson|JPL|We propose observations of the spectral reflectances of the Galilean Satellites of Jupiter as a function of their rotational phase angles. Such observations in the ultraviolet are expected to help map continental sized differences in composition and to help understand phenomena such as Io's extended sodium and hydrogen clouds. The execution of these observations now, instead of later, will permit them to be used in assistance of Voyager I encounter interpretation and Voyager II encounter planning.|Y
SSCHM|Observations of the Saturnian System in Coordination with the Voyager Flybys|H.Warren|Moos|Johns Hopkins University|A series of observations of Saturn and its satellites are proposed in coordination with the Voyager flybys. There are three major objectives: 1. Aid in the planning of the Voyager flyby; 2. Simultaneous observations of these objects by IUE and the Voyager spacecraft to tie all IUE observations to the Voyager experiments; and 3. High quality IUE spectra to facilitate interpretation of the data obtained by the lower spectral resolution Voyager spectrophotometers.|Y
SSDAL|UV Spectrophotometry of the Saturnian Satellites Iapetus & Rhea|Arthur L.|Lane|Jet Propulsion Laboratory|A limited program of low resolution, 2000-3300 A spectrophotometric observations of the Saturnian satellites Iapetus and Rhea is proposed. Visible and infrared wavelength observations have shown Rhea to have a water ice surface along with other unknown components. Iapetus also has a water ice surface, as deduced by the same observational methods, but detectable only on one face. The opposite face is of unknown surface composition. This phenomenon appears to be responsible for the strong modulation of the orbital light curve of Iapetus.  The proposed IUE observations are designed to acquire data which could elucidate some aspects of the surface composition and past history of these two satellites. The same methodology has yielded impressive results for the Galilean satellites. The data, if acquired during the spring 1981 apparition, can be used to modify and improve the Voyager 2 photopolarimeter and imaging studies of these bodies (late summer 1981). If not acquired until the spring 1982 apparition, then the data and the analyzed results will be used to support additional interpretation of Voyager 2 data acquired during its Saturn flyby. The Voyager UV spectrometer measures shortward of 1700 A, and the cameras do not respond below 3500 A. The IUE results will form a substantive part of the total satellite science relating to Rhea, Iapetus and possibly the magnetospheric physics of the Saturnian system.|Y
SSEAL|UV Spectrophotometry of the Saturnian Satellites Iapetus, Rhea & Dione|Arthur L.|Lane|JPL|A limited program of low resolution, 2000-3000 A spectrophotometric observations of the Saturnian satellites Iapetus, Rhea, and Dione is proposed. Visible and infrared wavelength observations have shown Rhea to have a water ice surface along with other unknown components. Iapetus also has a water ice surface, as deduced by the same observational methods, but detectable only on one face. The opposite face is of unknown surface composition. This phenomenon appears to be responsible for the strong modulation of the orbital light curve of Iapetus.  The proposed IUE observations are designed to acquire data which could elucidate some aspects of the surface composition and past history of these three satellites. The same methodology has yielded impressive results for the Galilean satellites.  The initial data acquired in the spring of 1981 demonstrated that we could obtain spectra of Rhea and Iapetus. These objects were brighter than expected in the near-UV, based upon visible albedos and models which assumed characteristics of other "known" icy satellites - namely, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. The Voyager 2 imaging data on Iapetus still do not elucidate whether the material on the dark face is of exogenic or endogenic origin. The IUE spectra we hope to acquire should help with this problem, and will provide calibration and phase curve data for intercomparison with the Voyager 2 photcpolarimeter data on Iapetus and Rhea. We expect these spectra will form a substantive part of the satellite science relating to Rhea, Iapetus and Dione. The Dione data may show evidence of the effects of the Saturnian oxygen ion torus which should affect Dione's trailing surface.|Y
SSFJC|IUE Solar System Observationd, II. Saturn's Rings|John J.|Caldwell|Stony Brook|LWR and SWP observations up to 3 hours will permit us to extend reflectivity measurements of Saturn's rings down to 1800 A.  We will compare the results to published ice reflectivity curves. We will also use the ring results to calibrate old OAO-2 spectrophotometry, which has no spatial resolution and therefore includes the rings. Subsequently we will compare old and new Saturn data for evidence of seasonal changes.|Y

Phosphine (PH3) is a plausible candidate variable species.|Y
SSHJL|IUE Studies of Infrared D-Type Symbiotic Stars/Planetary Nebulae|Julie H.|Lutz|Washington State University|This is a proposal to obtain low resolution IUE observations of some objects which have been classified both as infrared D-type symbiotic stars and as planetary nebulae. Optical fluxes over the wavelength range 3200 to 8000 A will also be obtained. Electron temperatures and densities will be derived from diagnostic emission line ratios, all of which require both optical and ultraviolet line fluxes. Abundances of He, C, N, O and Ne will be derived. The ultraviolet lines are essential for this analysis, particularly for C, N and Ne. Other parameters such as hot star temperatures and distances (from optical data) will be derived. The data will be used to ascertain the evolutionary state of these objects and to learn more about compact and/or binary planetary nebulae and unusual symbiotic stars.|Y
SSHMA|Comets as Targets of Opportunity|Michael F.|A'Hearn|Maryland|We propose to obtain spectra of any newly discovered comets as a function of heliocentric distance. High resolution studies should yield information regarding the D/H ratio, the importance of collisions in the inner coma, and the details of the continuum reflectivity of tile solid particles. Low resolution spectra will enable us to investigate the relationship between tile production of carbon-containing species and the production of H2O, the spatial distribution of ions, and the differences between dusty and gassy comets.|Y
SSHRN|UV Spectrophotometry: Galilean and Saturnian Satellites and Asteroids|Robert M.|Nelson|JPL|We propose a series of ultraviolet spectral observations of airless solar system objects, specifically the Galilean satellites of Jupiter, several satellites of Saturn, and selected asteroids. In the past such spectral observations of planetary satellites have allowed for the identification of spectrally active solid state materials on planetary satellite surfaces. Furthermore, because the rotational properties are known for all the satellites proposed for study, this technique has allowed us to begin production of a longitude map of the distribution of such materials on the objects' surfaces. The asteroid spectra we have previously acquired with the IUE have created unique subdivisions within the existent asteroid types. Because Io is the most volcanically active body in the solar system, and short term variations in selected regions of the Jovian magnetosphere are known to occur, it is important to take spectra regularly at large, solar phase angles to check for temporal variations in the spectra. We propose an additional set of Galilean satellite observations at low solar phase angle in order to study the opposition brightness surge of these objects in the UV. Our observations made during the seventh IUE episode have established the existence of an opposition surge on one hemisphere of Io and a smaller surge on Europa. These results indicate that lo's regolith is very porous and Europa's regolith is much more compact on one side than the other. These proposed UV observations are critical to the sequence design of several instruments on Project Galileo. Spectra of Iapetus, Rhea and Dione have been acquired during the previous two years; however, only at orbital locations near elongation. We wish to continue the Saturnian satellite observations to acquire a few other orbital phase angles for Dione and Rhea. The Voyager spacecraft made a few broad-band measurements of these objects at 260 nm but IUE data are needed to fix the low solar phase angle data.|Y
SSHWJ|A Proposal for Observations of Comet C/Giacobini-Zinner|William M.|Jackson|Howard University|We propose to investigate the inner coma of Comet P/Giacobini-Z inner, by investigating the CS scale length, and, when possible, the rotational profile of CS, from IUE observations. The information that is obtained will be used to test and calibrate gas dynamic flow models of comets. This investigation will be complemented by a laboratory program which will measure the state-to-state rate constants for the important reactions.|Y
SSIDS|Observations of Hydrogen Emission from Saturn|Donald E.|Shemansky|Arizona|It has beau established that the strong equatorial emissions of atomic and molecular hydrogen from Jupiter and Saturn are produced predominantly by particle excitation. The energy deposition rates are too high to be explained by the influx of solar radiation, although deposition of solar radiation appears to be a controlling factor. Research into the possible dependence of the Jupiter emission on the solar cycle in a related IUE program has shown that the atomic H Ly-alpha emission is variable, but the H2 emissions are basically constant over long time scales. There is some evidence that Saturn shows a similar behavior. These processes on both planets are not understood, and because of the fact that substantial energy is involved, further study of the phenomena is important. We propose to make observations of the Saturn EUV spectrum of atomic and molecular hydrogen at a time of solar minimum. The results can then be compared with earlier observations, and with similar observations of Jupiter, in order to determine relationships of the phenomena.|Y
SSIHM|Variations in Saturn and Uranus|H. Warren|Moos|Johns Hopkins University|The goals of the proposal research are threefold. 1. To reliably detect the expected longitudinal dependence of the Saturnian auroral emission and to compare the location of the emission peak to that at the time of the Voyager encounter 2. To measure the Saturnian aurorae when the solar wind plasma is normal as a baseline for Target of Opportunity observations proposed separately, and to continue the monitoring of the Saturnian ultraviolet spectra which has been under way for a significant fraction of a solar cycle. 3. To monitor the Uranian Ly-alpha emissions following the Voyager observations and the HUT observations in early 1986.|Y
SSJDS|Observations of Hydrogen Emission from Saturn|Donald E.|Shemansky|Arizona|It has been established that the strong equatorial emissions of atomic and molecular hydrogen from Jupiter and Saturn are produced predominantly by particle excitation. The energy deposition rates are too high to be explained by the influx of solar radiation, although deposition of solar radiation appears to be a controlling factor. Research into the possible dependence of the Jupiter emission on the solar cycle in a related IUE program has shown that the atomic H Ly-alpha emission is variable, but the H2 emissions are basically constant over long time scales. We now have disk averaged Saturn measurements obtained on DOY 252 and 254, 1986 which indicate H Ly-alpaa brightness a factor of 5 below the value measured in 1980; during the same time span the Jupiter H Ly-alpha brightness varied by a factor of 2, while Uranus apparently remained constant. Saturn in fact displayed moderately strong variation in H Ly-alphaa emission in the ~1 year interval between Voyager encounters, while H2 band a mission rates remained essentially constant. The source of energy for the process now known as electroglow, is unexplained. Variations within the phenomenon, in which Jupiter and Saturn appear to show instability in the abundance of atomic hydrogen, while Uranus appears basically constant, clearly require further study. We propose to make observations of the Saturn EUV spectrum of atomic and molecular hydrogen at a time of solar minimum. The results can then be compared with earlier observations, and with similar observations of Jupiter, in order to determine how the processes are connected to solar activity.|Y

To continue the measurements of the variable Uranian Ly-alpha emissions which were first detected in IUE in 1982 and shown by Voyager to be due to the poorly understood "electroglow" process as well as auroral activity.|Y
SSKCM|The Stromgren Sphere of SS Cyg|Christopher W.|Mauche|Los Alamos|We propose to obtain high-resolution SWP spectra of seven moderately faint (V<7 mag) B stars in the vicinity of SS Cyg to probe the size and ionization structure of the Stromgren sphere, interstellar bubble, or bow shock surrounding this cataclysmic variable. These measurements, accompanied by theoretical photoionization calculations, will allow us to place strong constraints on the poorly-known ionizing EUV and soft X-ray flux of SS Cyg, the mechanical luminosity of its wind, and the density of the interstellar medium in the immediate vicinity of SS Cyg. Furthermore, given these constraints on the parameters affecting the highly-ionized gas surrounding SS Cyg, we will be in a better situation to understand the nature of the intriguing bow-shock-like emission nebula surrounding the cataclysmic variable 0623+71.|Y
SSKDS|Observations of Hydrogen Emission from Saturn|Donald E.|Shemansky|Arizona|The purpose of this program is to examine the long term morphology of the hydrogen emissions from the Saturn sunlit atmosphere, with a view of defining energy deposition mechanisms, and relationships of behavior relative to the other outer planets. This IUE series in combination with Voyager data has identified a strong variation in the equatorial H Ly-alpha emission; a factor of ~5 between 1980 and 1986, while over the same time span the Jupiter H Ly-alpha varied by a factor of 2, and Uranus was invariant. These distinctive differences point to a nonlinear relationship to solar radiation, and rather independent behavior of the three outer planets. The variability of H Ly-alpha and the spectral shape of the H2 band emissions point to a dominance of electron excitation, but a theory for the energy deposition mechanism has not been established. We propose to continue the observations of H Ly-alpha and H2 emission for the purpose of determining the controlling factors in variability, and comparative planetology. The results will be compared to earlier observations, and with similar observations of Jupiter, in order to determine the connection of the processes to solar activity. We emphasize the need for careful solar system model reduction of' the observations of Saturn.|Y
SSKTS|IUE Observations of Triton in Support of Voyager|Thomas E.|Skinner|Colorado LASP|Ground-based observations of Triton have provided ambiguous evidence for molecular nitrogen on the satellite's surface. The presence of N2 on Triton is not unexpected, based on cosmological abundance arguments and by analogy with the Saturnian satellite Titan, which has a thick N2 atmosphere. A contiguous Vilspa-US1 shift, preceded by a partial US2 shift, is requested in order to search for Rayleigh scattering in the Triton atmosphere. The failure of ground-based searches to detect a Rayleigh scattering "UV upturn" in spectra of Triton's atmosphere can be explained by the large N2 columns (requiring correspondingly high surface temperatures) necessary to produce an observable effect above ~3200 A. At the cold temperatures present on Triton's surface, an increase in the albedo expected from Rayleigh scattering below 3200 A presents us with a valuable diagnostic for determining the presence or absence of a thick N2 atmosphere on Triton. Either result has important implications for the Voyager mission to Neptune, since targeting for occultation experiments depends on whether Triton's atmosphere is thick or thin. In addition, we will measure, for the first time, the ultraviolet albedo and color of Triton in the LWP spectral range 1825-3300 A, enabling the valuable comparison of Triton with other solar system objects in the UV.|Y
SSLDS|Observations of Hydorgen Emission from the Sunlit Atmosphere of Saturn|Donald E.|Shemansky|Arizona|The purpose of this program is to examine the long term morphology of the hydrogen emissions from the Saturn sunlit atmosphere, with a view of defining energy deposition mechanisms, and relationships of behavior relative to the other outer planets. The last two observational sessions in this series have now shown strong uncorrelated relative variation in emission brightness from both Jupiter and Saturn. The earlier data on Saturn had shown a steady decrease in H Ly-alpha emission by a large factor since 1980. The latest data from DOY 1988/220 shows no response at Saturn to a sharp upturn in the solar H Ly-alpha flux as we move toward the maximum of solar cycle 22. At the same time, the emission rate from Jupiter has increased sharply with a substantially greater variation than the solar H Ly-alpha source. These results relate directly to the processes exciting the upper atmosphere. It is now becoming quite clear with this series of consistent measurements that none of the outer planets show a one to one relationship to solar flux (at least in the solar emissions between 584A and 1216A), or from one planet to another. The planet to planet independence in behavior especially graphically indicated the last measurements in 1988, seem to indicate a dominance of internal control. The factors that produce such apparent strong variation in the atomic hydrogen content of the Saturn atmosphere require further investigation. We propose to continue monitoring the atomic and molecular hydrogen emissions for the purpose of determining the controlling factors producing variability excitation and heat input to the upper atmosphere. The current evidence in planet to planet behavior emphasizes the need for comparative measurements between Jupiter and Saturn. We emphasize the need for careful solar system model reduction of the Saturn observations.|Y
SSLWM|Auroral and Diffuse Emissions from Saturn and Uranus|H. Warren|Moos|Johns Hopkins University|Although the outer planets have similar (but not identical) atmospheres, their magnetospheres and upper atmospheric heating processes are quite different. The ultraviolet emission spectra display signatures of the excitation processes which can be used to understand these differences. The research proposed here will obtain new spectra of Saturn and Uranus for the following purposes: (1) to determine the variations of Saturn's auroral activity with the solar cycle using the molecular hydrogen emission; (2) to determine whether the Saturnian aurora has a longitudinal or short-time-scale dependence and to compare the location of the current emission peak with that of the Voyager encounter by using a new technique, the variation of the atomic hydrogen Ly-alpha emission, rather than the molecular hydrogen emission utilized in the past; (3) to measure the UV emissions from Saturn at a time when the solar wind impinging on Saturn can also be measured with other spacecraft in the event of a large solar wind disturbance; and (4) to continue the measurements of the variable Uranian Ly-alpha emissions which were first detected by IUE in 1982 and shown by Voyager to be due to a poorly understood combination of excitation processes and auroral activity.|Y

SSMJC|Saturn's Aurora at Solar Maximum|John T.|Clarke|Michigan|IUE observations of Saturn during the last solar maximum in 1980 detected bright polar auroral H Ly-alpha emission from both northern and southern auroral zones. These aurora were variable, appearing in roughly 1/3 of the polar SWP spectra. Following a couple of years without any IUE observations, subsequent IUE observations detected only faint auroral emission from Saturn. This is consistent with a solar wind driven substorm process, similar to the Earth's aurora, where the brightest aurora appear during and just following solar maximum. There is also an indication of a longitudinal asymmetry in the auroral brightness from Voyager UVS observations during the last solar maximum. We propose to observe the brightness of Saturn's aurora as a function of longitude near solar maximum (cycle 22) to test these two variability scenarios. In an additional shift somewhat later, we will observe the auroral H Ly-alpha line profile at high dispersion at the brightest auroral longitude to determine the contribution of proton precipitation to Saturn's aurora. It is important to perform these observations this year to provide a baseline for CASSINI observations of Saturn at the next solar maximum (starting in 2002, cycle 23).|Y
SSNJC|Targets of Opportunity in the Outer Solar System|John T.|Clarke|U Michigan|The sudden appearance of an enormous white cloud along Saturn's equator this fall initiated a series of observations with the Hubble Space Telescope (WF/PC images) and the IUE (low dispersion spectra). Although the proposers were able to respond quickly (mainly by being already present at GSFC) and carry out two observing sessions (3 shifts) of Saturn to study this storm system, it became clear that a properly submitted Target of Opportunity program should be established to optimize the potential scientific benefits that could be obtained from future storm systems that may develop during this Saturn summer. We principally wish to observe any future storm clouds as early as possible, when the upwelling material is still partially in the gas phase (pre-condensation) and identifiable spectroscopically. This violent upwelling provides a unique opportunity to identify the composition of the lower (sub-cloud) atmosphere. We include in this program observations of lo and the plasma torus in the event that groundbased IR observations discover a major volcanic event from one of the known plumes in the form of a pronounced IR brightening. Such an event is believed to sharply increase the mass supply into the torus, which should be observable with IUE as a test of the Io atmosphere/torus coupling.|Y
SSNMM|Ultraviolet Emissions from Saturn and Uranus|Melissa A.|McGrath|Johns Hopkins University|Substantial progress made in the last year on analysis of Saturn IUE data, obtained regularly since 1980, clearly demonstrates the value of this data set, and underscores the usefulness of IUE for studying Saturn. Given this progress, it is now appropriate to study Saturn in more detail, particularly in view of the Cassini mission scheduled for the late 1990s. We propose to establish clearly whether spatial or short-time-scale variations are occurring in the Saturn auroral emissions by increasing the temporal and longitudinal sampling beyond those currently used. To achieve this we have combined two successful IUE 13th episode programs (Clarke; Moos et al.) and increased by one the total number of US shifts devoted to Saturn. In collaboration with European colleagues (Prange et al.) several VILSPA shifts have also been requested from ESA to be scheduled contiguously with the US1 and US2 shifts requested in this program. This will provide roughly two full rotations of longitudinal coverage with high quality data, and should improve dramatically the chances of detecting whether longitudinal or short-time-scale variations are occurring. In the event that an auroral outburst is not detected. the data will still be quite useful for studying the Saturn Ly-alpha dayglow. Ly-alpha emission from Uranus will be monitored to further determine the magnitude and frequency of its variability and to search for systematics present in this emission. Uranus observations will also be used to evaluate the long-term variation in hydrocarbon abundances, and co-added to attempt detection of H2 emission.|Y
SSOBL|Are Miras with Masers Symbiotic Stars?|B. Murray|Lewis|Arecibo Observatory - NAIC|Few stars are solitary. While a luminous old star has a >5O% probability of having a degenerate companion, a mira variable with an oxygen-rich circumstellar shell and no masers has a rather higher probability of having a white-dwarf companion, whose UV production destroys most shell molecules before they can mase. We tested this scenario against IUE archival data, which give an 80% UV detection rate for sources with the IRAS colors of a dusty shell, and no detectable water or OH masers. But this rate is probably optimistic, since the archival stars were not observed as a test of the argument, and often exhibit optical spectral features that imply a degenerate companion. We are proposing here to directly test our scenario, by seeking the UV detection rate from a sample of normal miras, that have no water or OH masers. Payoffs from its validation include (i) an explanation for the absence of masers in ~40% of oxygen-rich circumstellar shells, (ii) a rationale for stellar identifications for some ROSAT white dwarfs, (iii) an estimate for the frequency of binaries with widely-separated components, (iv) a procedure for estimating the frequency of common envelope binaries.|Y
SSOBM|The Circumstellar Material of Socket Stars|Bruce|McCollum|CSC - IUE Observatory|Taking advantage of the IUE's spatial resolution capability, we intend to determine the extent and nature of UV emission associated with socket stars. Socket stars are stars in HII regions surrounded by circumstellar material of an unknown nature. The few good-quality IUE data available suggest that the grains along the line of sight to the socket stars may not be typical interstellar grains. However, it is not clear if the grains suggested by the UV spectra are associated with the socket material or foreground material. Observing time is requested to obtain the UV maps, as well as improved spectra of selected socket stars. New IUE spectra will enable us to determine the presence or absence of UV scattering in the sockets, and to model grain sizes and distributions in the socket material.|Y
SSOHJ|The Unusual S Star System HD 191589|Hollis R.|Johnson|Indiana University|Through a search for the putative white-dwarf companions with IUE, we have for several years been testing the popular hypothesis that Tc-deficient S and MS stars are not thermally pulsing AGB stars but are mass-transfer binaries. Several companions have been discovered, and all evidence supports the idea, Recently, we discovered an F0-F2 IV-V companion to the Tc-poor S star HD 191589. This offers the unexpected possibility that the less evolved (IV-V) companion star may also be contaminated by sprocessed material, and this might be the first such star known. We propose to search for enhancement of s-process element abundance by obtaining a high-resolution IUE LWP spectrum and comparing it to spectra of similar stars slid to synthetic spectra.|Y
SSOMM|Targets of Opportunity in the Outer Solar System|Melissa A.|McGrath|Johns Hopkins University|This program has been initiated to cover several events requiring response times from several days to several months that may present significant opportunities for important IUE observations in the 15th episode, including Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer (EUVE) observations of Jupiter and the lo plasma torus, ROSAT observations of the Jovian aurora, and volcanic variability on Io determined from IR measurements. Simultaneous observations between IUE and EUVE or ROSAT will be invaluable in helping to determine the composition and origin of the precipitating particles in the Jovian aurora. Although these observations are anticipated in the IUE 15th episode, they have not yet been scheduled. Also included in this program are observations of the Io plasma torus in the event that ground-based IR observations discover a major volcanic event in the form of a pronounced IR brightening. Such an event is believed to sharply increase the mass supply into the torus, which should be observable with IUE as a test of the lo atmosphere/torus coupling.|Y
SSPRS|Baselineing the UV Properties of Slash Stars|Regina E.|Schulte-Ladbeck|U Pittsburgh|How do massive stars evolve? Since Ofpe/WN9 (or "slash") stars display transitory spectroscopic properties between OB and Wolf-Rayet stars in their optical spectra, are they also objects in transition in their evolution? We here propose to use IUE spectra to derive stellar parameters for the slash stars from UV spectral classification together with existing Teff-L vs. spectral-type calibrations and to study their winds using P Cygni profiles of the resonance lines; we wish to measure blue-edge velocities, ionic column densities, and infer mass-loss rates and (differential) ionic abundances. These results will allow us to investigate empirically the evolutionary status of Ofpe/WN9 stars. The new observations will "baseline" the UV properties of slash stars, because (a) they will generate a complete set of useful UV spectrograms, which (b) may be used as input for more elaborate model atmospheres for stars with optically thick(er) winds, and (c) will establish the "quiescent" stellar/wind parameters; this is of importance should any undergo a drastic variation (as happened to the slash star R 127 gone LBV).|Y
SSPSK|Ultraviolet Observations of Accretion in Two Symbiotic Stars|Scott J.|Kenyon|Harvard CFA - SAO|We propose to acquire IUE observations of two symbiotic binaries - CI Cyg and AX Per - over a complete orbital cycle. Our previous studies of these systems - using archival IUE data - showed that accretion from a lobe-filling red giant primary star powers the hot component in both systems. The disks in these binaries appear to be optically thin during quiescence and optically thick in an eruption; the boundary layer between the inner edge of the disk and the star ionizes a surrounding H II region during quiescence, and this luminosity first increases and then fades dramatically in outburst.  New UV observations of CI Cyg will allow us to follow the evolution of a quiescent disk and boundary layer around a complete orbit for the first time in any symbiotic system. New UV observations of AX Per will enable us to study the decline from its 1987 eruption and compare our results to those we inferred from the decline of CI Cyg.|Y
SSQRP|SS Sygni in Outburst: Comprehensive Coverage of Wide and Narrow Outbursts|Ronald|Polidan|NASA/GSFC|We propose to obtain SWP and LWP spectra of SS Cyg on the decline from maximum light to quiescence during wide outbursts. Despite extensive IUE observations of SS Cyg, NO useable data exists covering virtually the entire decline for wide outbursts - a shocking gap in the archive. In addition, we propose to fill a small coverage gap in the decline from maximum in narrow outbursts of SS Cyg. The purpose of these observations is create a comprehensive archive of IUE data on SS Cyg and to then use this archive to test theoretical models for dwarf novae outbursts. We will test whether a constant UV slope is maintained as flux declines, as seen in narrow outbursts for SS Cyg and other dwarf novae. The new observations will be combined with the extensive archival IUE observations and new observations from EUVE and Voyager. These data will be also used to study aspects of the dwarf nova outburst phenomenon, particularly the wind development and evolution, including timing, of the line spectrum in the two types of outbursts. The proposed observations match the criteria for critical program in Episode 17, since the additional data fills a glaring gap in the IUE data archive and complements similar observations from short outbursts that already exist in the archive. This improved archive will allow new scientific questions to be addressed.|Y

STBDB|The Sun, A CEN A and Cluster Stars in the HR Diagram|Don C.|Barry|Southern California|The primary objective of this proposal is to improve our knowledge of the position of the Sun and alpha CEN A in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. The exact position of the Sun's zero age main sequence (ZAMS) depends on the ratio of heavy elements to hydrogen (metallicity). The goals are (1) to identify whether the Sun's ZAMS was a moderately weak-line sequence such as the unevolved portion of the Coma or Ursa Major cluster main sequences or a strong-line sequence such as the unevolved portion of the Hyades main sequence (or somewhere between), and (2) to accurately place the Sun in the observed temperature sequences of the nearby clusters. The question of the Sun's luminosity (gravity) relative to the main sequences of the nearby clusters will be considered also. alpha CEN A will be studied in the same way as the Sun and the results will be compared.  An expected secondary result of this investigation is to confirm or deny the identity of VB 15 and/or VB 64 as solar "twins" - i.e., as having spectra which are nearly indistinguishable from the solar spectrum. The proposed procedure will determine empirically the effect on the spectrum of differences in metallicity as well as differences in temperature and gravity. Small differences between the solar spectrum and the spectrum of VB 15 or any other suspected solar twin can be evaluated quantitatively as metallicity or temperature or gravity differences.|Y
STFCI|Ultraviolet Data on Young Stars Relevant to the Earth's Early Atmosphere|Catherine L.|Imhoff|CSC|Understanding the formation of the earth, the evolution of the atmosphere, and the origin and evolution of life is heavily dependent on our knowledge of the early Sun and its evolutionary history. Much of what we know about the young Sun is inferred from the behavior of other stars. By identifying and studying solar-like stars of various ages, one can in effect simulate the evolution of the Sun.  Research on young stars with IUE has demonstrated that these stars are relatively strong ultraviolet sources. Preliminary results indicate that the degree of UV flux enhancement over present levels changes both with wavelength region and evolutionary history. We propose to use archived IUE data acquired for a number of young solartype stars to investigate the evolution of the Sun's ultraviolet spectrum over time and its bearing on the Earth's early atmosphere.  In our earlier work. we used IUE spectra of T Tauri and young solar-type stars to indicate an overall enhancement of about 10^4 in the far-ultraviolet emission-line fluxes of the young Sun over the present values. Our photochemical calculations, using these enhanced UV fluxes as input, resulted in significantly higher levels of oxygen and ozone in the prebiological early atmosphere than previously believed. The proposed analysis of IUE data would provide important refinements in the ultraviolet data required as input to our photochemical models and aid in deriving an improved chronology for the evolution of the Sun, Earth, its atmosphere, and life. Because of the ubiquitous importance of the solar UV flux in solar-system studies, this IUE study will benefit research activities in other areas, as well.|Y
STFMA|Solar Analogs for Calibration of Reflectivities of Bodies in the Solar System|Michael F.|A'Hearn|Maryland|Calibration of the reflectivity of solar system bodies requires accurate knowledge of the solar spectrum, specifically as it would he seen by IUE. We propose to combine archival data on some solar analogs with new observations of additional solar analogs to derive a more reliable solar spectrum for use in solar system studies, particularly in our own work on cometary spectra obtained with IUE.|Y
STFTA|SME and IUE: The Solar-Stellar Connection|Thomas R.|Ayres|Colorado Lasp|The importance of the Sun in interpreting the spectra of other latetype main-sequence stars is unquestioned. Unfortunately, however, the solar-stellar connection often has been frustrated by the difficulty of comparing solar and stellar observations on the same terms. In particular, few solar instruments to date have had the capability to observe even the brightest G-type dwarfs, while sensitive stellar experiments are too delicate to be pointed even close to the Sun.  For the past year, however, a new satellite has been observing the Sun as if it were an unresolved star. The irradiance monitor on the Solar Mesosphere Explorer satellite, built and operated by the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics, measures the ultraviolet emission spectrum of the Sun in integrated light several times a day at 7 A resolution. The SME solar irradiance measurements are utilized by aeronomers to study the photochemistry of terrestrial ozone, but the character of the observations suggests that they would be ideally suited for comparisons with the ultraviolet spectra of other solartype stars observed at low dispersion with the International Ultraviolet Explorer.  We propose, therefore, to collect from the IUE data archives the available low dispersion spectra of solar-type (G0-G5) main sequence stars, and compare their chromospheric and higher temperature emission spectra with those of the Sun as monitored on a daily basis since the launch of SME a year ago.  The SME-IUE comparisons will be applied to examine the differential behavior of a number of emission species in the far ultraviolet spectrum in the spirit of the correlation diagrams constructed by Ayres, Marstad, and Linsky for late-type dwarfs, giants and supergiants. The resulting correlation diagrams can be utilized in studies of the nonradiative heating mechanisms at different levels of the stellar outer atmosphere. Furthermore, a detailed examination of the rotational modulation of solar ultraviolet activity indices can be compared to analogous IUE monitoring studies of solartype stars to aid in the interpretation of their results. Finally, the development of correlation relationships between H I Ly-alpha emission and that of other chromospheric species on the basis of the SME solar observations can be applied to IUE observations of Ly-alpha emission from nearby solar-type stars in order to study interstellar neutral hydrogen absorption in the solar vicinity.|Y
STFTS|A Study of Two, Young, Solar Type Stars| | |Hawaii|Chi-1 Ori (GO V) and 59 Vir (G0 V) are among the youngest solartype stars in the nearby field. Their Li ages are estimated to be 0.6 Gyr and 0.1 Gyr, respectively. Both stars were observed with IUE in low resolution by Simon and Boesgaard (1983) in a study of the relation between ultraviolet chromospheric activity and age. These young stars have strong chromospheric and transition region lines, and are among the few solar-type stars observable with high dispersion in the short wavelength (1200 - 2000A) camera of IUE.  In this proposal we are requesting time for a program of high dispersion spectroscopy to secure double-shift exposures (up to 16 hours) of each star with the SWP camera. We propose to do this by scheduling contiguous NASA - ESA 8 hour shifts. These observations will allow us to resolve the profiles of individual chromospheric and transition region emission lines, from which we will derive temperature, density, and velocity-field models. NLTE radiative transfer calculations will be used to study lines formed in the low chromsphere, T < 20000 K; an emission measure analysis of the UV lines formed above this height and Einstein Observatory X ray fluxes will be used to model the higher temperature regions extending into the coronae of these two stars. With the derived models. we will investigate the energy balance and non-thermal energy requirements of these atmospheres, in addition to the evolution of chromospheric, transition region, and coronal Structure among stars much younger than the Sun.|Y
STHAH|The Strength of Ultraviolet Spectral Features|Albert V.|Holm|CSC|We propose to study the variation of the strength of spectral features with spectral classification using the uniform set of low resolution spectra collected in the IUE ultraviolet spectral atlas (Wu et al. 1983) and using selected echelle spectra of the same sources. This study will be used to: place ultraviolet spectral classification on a quantitative basis.  - provide a data base for comparison with hot stars having luminous red companions and with unusual and variable stars, for use in determining ultraviolet extinction curves, and for use in population synthesis studies.  This work will be done completely with archival spectra.|Y
STHRP|Ultraviolet Spectra of Spectrophotometric Standard Stars|Ronald E.|Pitts|CSC|By the end of the IUE mission, the archives will contain an extensive data base of ultraviolet spectra for a wide variety of stellar objects. The usefulness of this data base will be greatly enhanced provided that it contains a sufficient number of well observed standard stars so that direct comparisons may be made between the absolute flux scales of IUE and those obtained for other instruments in overlapping spectral regions.  A number of ground based observers including Oke (1964), Breger (1976), Stone (1977), Oke and Gunn (1983), and Taylor (1984) have observed and defined sets of spectrophotometric standards. The primary spectrophotometric standard is Vega with 109 Vir as an alternate primary standard (Davis Philip and Hayes 1984). The primary and secondary standards form a group of approximately two dozen stars roughly equally spaced in right ascension near the celestial equator.  A search of the present IUE data archives reveals that a number of these standard stars have either not been observed with IUE at all or are poorly represented. The important alternate primary standard 109 Vir, for example, is represented by a single set of LWR and SWP high dispersion images taken shortly after launch. There are no low dispersion images from which absolute flux measurements could be obtained. Since IUE observations are being used to develop faint spectrophotometric standards for the calibration of instruments on Space Telescope, it is important that observations of the bright spectrophotometric standards used in ground-based observing be used to verify the consistency of the IUE calibration and ground-based calibrations and to enable comparisons with other absolutely calibrated data.  We propose to obtain several LWP exposures optimized for the 2800, 3000, and 3200 A regions in low dispersion for a number of the spectrophotometric standards in order to obtain absolute flux measurements on the IUE system. These will be used to verify consistency with ground-based spectrophotometry and, if needed, revise the absolute flux scales used in the important overlap region near the atmospheric cutoff. We should also like to utilize high dispersion spectra of these same objects in order to search for any peculiarities in these standards and to interpret the measured fluxes. |Y
STIRB|IUE Sensitivity Degradation Functions|Ralph C.|Bohlin|STScI|The IUE program to establish standard UV calibration stars for the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) is complicated by the gradual loss in sensitivity. The degradation of the IUE response is worst for the LWR camera at 2300A. However, the decline for the SWP and LWP cameras that are used for the HST standards program is significant in comparison with the accuracy goal of 1 to 3% relative to the initial epoch. The SWP had dropped by 7% at the longer wavelengths in 1984 and the LWP will he at least that bad in 1985 over a shorter baseline in time.  At present, only the LWR has a correction algorithm for sensitivity changes in low dispersion. The goals of this proposal are twofold: 1) to develop a correction algorithm for SWP and LWP that is at least as precise as the existing LWR correction and 2) to investigate the time changes on a finer wavelength scale with the goal of developing more precise corrections, if that is both possible and necessary.|Y
STJRP|Trailed Spectra of Bright Spectrophotometric Standard Stars|Ronald E.|Pitts|CSC|The IUE archives is an extensive and growing database of UV spectra of a wide variety of astronomical objects. The usefulness of the archives will be greatly enhanced by the presence of a number of wellobserved standard stars including those which define the visual wavelength absolute flux calibrations. Observation of ground-based spectrophotometric standards by IUE will be useful for providing a selfconsistent flux calibration for bright stars and for permitting direct comparisons with fainter standards for future missions, already in the archives, on the IUE system.  New observing techniques now make it possible for IUE to obtain well-exposed spectra of these bright stars. However, this observing method is one of the few which may not be possible if IUE were to lose another gyro and the backup control mode, now under development, were used.  We propose to obtain short and long wavelength spectra for four of the brightest spectrophotometric standard stars which have either not been observed with with IUE or are poorly represented in the IUE archives. Over a number of years these stars have been observed and defined as standards by a number of ground based observers including Oke(1964), Breger (1976), Stone(1977), Oke and Gunn (1983), and Taylor (1984). The primary standard has been Vega with 109 Vir as an alternate (Davis Philip and Hayes 1984). By combining trailed and point source spectra, ultraviolet absolute flux distributions will be obtained for the 1200-3200 A interval. A comparison will be made of Alpha Lyr and 109 Vir with the nearby star Alpha CMA A, which has a well-determined distance and measured radius. The suspected low-level intermittent variability of Alpha Lyr is not believed to pose major problems for our analysis.|Y
STKRK|Supernova Spectroscopy|Robert P.|Kirshner|Harvard CFA - SAO|The ultraviolet study of SN 1987A demonstrates the value of having a target of opportunity program to study supernovae. The ultraviolet data were gathered promptly, with some understanding of their ultimate scientific use, and the data were used to investigate the stellar progenitor, the kinematics and composition of the explosion, the energy distribution of the flux, the interstellar medium in our Galaxy and in the LMC, and now show strong evidence for circumstellar matter surrounding the explosion. The utility of UV observations to the field of supernovae is clearly established by this work, and by earlier studies. However, it is clear that the field is not exhausted. Despite the outstanding work on SN 1987A, the current set of UV data on supernovae is limited, and the objects demonstrate a wide variety of behavior in the UV which needs further study. We propose to use the IUE to obtain spectra of newly-discovered bright supernovae. It is important to supernova research to expand the coverage to include at least one well-observed SN I and to see the variation in properties for SN II. In the case of SN I, the UV observations place important constraints on the theoretical models by revealing the bolometric energy distribution as well as chemical properties. In the case of SN II, IUE observations are especially useful in studying the circumstellar material that surrounds the explosion. Supernovae of either type can be used to examine the interstellar gas in the disk and halo of our Galaxy and of the galaxy in which the supernova is located.|Y
STOFB|Delineating the Spectral Type Boundary for the Onset of Chromospheric Activity|Frederick C.|Bruhweiler|Catholic University|This is a follow-up of the previous year's proposal on the study of Ly-alpha emission in A-F stars. We have detected Ly-alpha chromospheric emission in the observed A-F stars up to the spectral type A7. Although fundamental insights on the problem of chromospheric structure and energy loss at this spectral type have been achieved from these observations, neither the spectral boundary for chromospheric emission, nor the heating mechanism has yet been identified.  The aim of the proposed IUE observations is to search in stars with spectral types up to A3 for chromospheric Ly-alpha emission. This spectral type seems to be the limit for detection of coronae by X-ray emission from both Einstein and ROSAT. We will observe five (5) stars in the spectral type interval F0-A3 spanning the luminosity range V-II.  Due to the uncertain status of the GHRS on the HST, the proposed observations would represent an unique opportunity to use the IUE to make substantial progress in delineating the spectral boundary for the onset of stellar chromospheres.|Y
SUECB|IUE Observations of H LY Alpha Emission From Uranus|C. Stuart|Bowyer|Cal Berkeley|We propose to perform a series of integrations with the SWP camera under low dispersion to observe the H Ly-alpha emission from Uranus. We plan to observe the planet in the large aperture and separate the weak planetary signal from the background geocoronal and interplanetary Ly-alpha emissions by spatially resolving the field of view within the aperture in two dimensions. Based on prior work on one-dimensional spatial imaging within this aperture at Ly-alpha, we estimate that a planet-averaged brightness of ~ 300 R will be detectable by this technique. This level of detection (or upper limit) is sufficient to place significant constraints on the column abundance of atomic hydrogen in Uranus' upper atmosphere, which can then be related to the degree of atmospheric mixing by the eddy diffusion coefficient. In addition, Uranus' north pole is presently close to edge on to the Earth, making it particularly likely that any active polar aurora on Uranus could be detected as bursts of Ly-alpha emission (similar to those detected from Saturn using the IUE).|Y
SUFCB|Observations of H LY Alpha Emission From Uranus|C. Stuart|Bowyer|UC Berkeley|We propose to perform a series of integrations with the SWP camera under low dispersion to observe the H Ly-alpha emission from Uranus by spatially resolving it from the background Ly-alpha emission which uniformly fills the large entrance aperture. We have used this technique on four days over the current observing season to successfully measure a disc-averaged brightness of ~400-800 R from Uranus. This range of brightness is anomalously high, and as a result of rapid variability in the emission seen in these observations (consisting of a doubling in ~ 48 hours) the emission has been interpreted as being largely auroral in nature, giving the first direct evidence for the existence of charged particle acceleration and therefore a strong magnetic field on Uranus. We propose to continue these observations in the upcoming season over four additional US2 shifts to try to learn the extent of the variability of the emission. If the Uranian aurora are similar to those studied on Jupiter and Saturn, they should vary over more than an order of magnitude in brightness. The lower limit to the observed Uranian H Ly-alpha brightness can then be interpreted as resonantly scattered solar emission, giving important information about the H column density and the extend of depletion of methane in Uranus' upper atmosphere.|Y
SUGJC|IUE Solar System Observations I. Uranus & Neptune Below 2000|John J.|Caldwell|Stony Brook|Proposed double shift observations of Uranus and Neptune with the large aperture of the SWP will be made to attempt verification of a molecular H2 aurora on Uranus (tentatively found by us with small aperture data after others discovered the H aurora at Ly-alpha) and to search for an H2 aurora on Neptune. The same data will also be used to improve existing signal to noise longward of 1650 A, in the region of reflected sunlight, to verify previous indications of differing amounts of absorption between the two planets, and to further investigate the possibility of secular change in the albedo of Uranus.|Y
SUGSD|Variability Time Scale of H Lyman Alpha from Uranus|Samuel T.|Durrance|Johns Hopkins University|We propose to continue our studies of the previously reported H Ly-alpha auroral emission from Uranus by making a series of observations over a complete rotational period of the planet. The goal of the observations is to determine the time scale for the variability of the auroral emission. This will provide information on the timescale for changes in the level of particle precipitation in the Uranus magnetosphere. If the auroral emission appears to be modulated by the rotation of the planet, as has been observed on Jupiter and possibly Saturn, this would provide fundamental information on the nature of the interaction between the Uranian magnetosphere and the solar wind. It may also indicate the tilt of the magnetic pole with respect to the spin axis and provide information on the rotation of the planetary core.|Y
SUHHM|Ultraviolet Study of Uranus and Saturn: Coordination with the Voyager and Astro Missions|H. Warren|Moos|John Hopkins University|A series of IUE spectra are required to improve our understanding of auroral processes on Saturn and Uranus. Intense variable Ly-alpha emissions have been observed from both planets. In the case of Uranus the presence of these emissions has been used as the first evidence for aurorae and hence a magnetic field. The three outer planets with auroral emissions observable by IUE (Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus) have roughly similar atmospheres but very different magnetospheres. Thus, ultraviolet spectra obtained by the same instrument under various solar conditions are extremely valuable for comparative studies of the three magnetospheres. In view of the Voyager encounter with Uranus in January 1986 and the ASTRO mission which will have the opportunity to study both Saturn and Uranus in March 1986, intensive study of these planets especially Uranus, is appropriate during the coming proposal year.|Y

SUHJC|Solar Wind Influence on Uranus Aurora|John T.|Clarke|MSFC|Having previously established the existence of auroral H Ly-alpha emission from Uranus and having studied both the short- and long-tern variability of this emission with IUE over the past three observing seasons, we now propose a more specific observational test of the physical nature of the Uranian magnetosphere. A unique opportunity for knowing the solar wind conditions at Uranus with a few days advance notice will occur during the approach of Voyager 2 toward Uranus over the calendar year 1985. Our plan is to wait for a large disturbance in the solar wind to be detected at Voyager 2, and then quickly observe the Uranus H Ly-alpha emission with IUE on a target of opportunity basis to look for a correlated increase in the auroral brightness during the passage of the solar wind disturbance. Previous experience has indicated that the solar wind detectors must be within roughly 3 AU of Uranus (1 year before encounter) for an accurate extrapolation, and the Voyager UVS will not be able to observe these aurora until a few months before the January 1986 encounter due to a high Ly-alpha background in their large aperture. The IUE in 1985 therefore appears to have the best chance of success in this experiment, and the opportunity may not be repeated until another spacecraft with solar wind diagnostics is sent to Uranus.|Y
SUIJC|H Lyman Alpha Emission From Uranus|John T.|Clarke|NASA/GSFC|Having recently reported on four years of observations of the Uranus H Ly-alpha emission and studies of possible correlations with the solar H Ly-alpha flux, the local solar wind density, the spin period of Uranus, etc., I now propose to continue these observations to expand on this program. Further observations will extend the IUE Uranus data to solar minimum (and the minimum solar H Ly-alpha and EUV fluxes), they will enable an extension of the data base of coordinated observations between IUE and the Voyager 2 solar wind detectors, and they will simply allow observations of any new phenomena that the Voyager 2 may discover at Uranus during its encounter in January 1986.|Y
SUKRW|High Resolution Observations of Uranus and Neptune|Richard|Wagener|Suny|The energy balance of the stratospheres of Uranus and Neptune is largely con- trolled by aerosols or haze, which absorb and emit radiative energy. Central to our understanding of the stratospheric thermal structure of these planets is a quantitative measure for the amounts of these aerosols and their vertical distribution. Raman scattering, which is sensitive to the gaseous component of an atmosphere, provides a diagnostic tool for the haze content. We propose to measure the Raman signal in the near UV with the IUE LWP camera in high resolution mode at the cores of the Fraunhofer lines of MgII and MgI. Besides spectra of Uranus and Neptune a reference spectrum of a body without an atmosphere is needed, which is used to isolate the Raman signal, and the time variability of the cores of the solar Fraunhofer lines during the observations must be monitored. We propose to obtain the reference spectrum from Ganymede, and to monitor the Sun's variability with several spectra of Mars. The IUE observations will be combined with ground based observations of other Fraunhofer lines that probe deeper into the atmosphere to derive a vertical haze distribution with the aid of multiple scattering models of the Rayleigh-Raman and aerosol effects.|Y
SULRK|Continuing Spectroscopy of SN 1987A|Robert P.|Kirshner|Harvard|The ultraviolet study of SN 1987A has proved rewarding and the opportunities for further work in the coming year are both feasible and valuable. The nature of the progenitor, the composition and dynamics of the surface layers, and the interstellar medium in the LMC and in the Milky Way have all been investigated with the UV data in hand. Current work concentrates on the radiation from the debris, the nature of the UV flash as the shock reached the stellar surface, and the circumstellar surround of the progenitor. The supernova is declining more slowly in the UV than in the optical and we can estimate the coverage required to provide an excellent record of the ultraviolet evolution for this once-in-a-lifetime event.|Y
SULSS|First UV Spectra of Uranian Satellites|S. Alan|Stern|Colorado LASP|To date, no UV spectrum of any Uranian satellite has ever been obtained, even by Voyager's UV Spectrometer which is not capable of operating redward of 1700 A. We propose to use IUE to obtain the first UV spectrum of a Uranian satellite by observing Oberon.  Oberon is the most distant and slowest moving of the five major Uranian satellites (Burns 1986; Lane, at al. 1986). It is UV bright, the operationally easiest to observe, and therefore the first Uranian satellite which IUE should study. IUE has successfully observed equally dim planetary objects (e.g., Pluto). Members of this proposal team have made IUE observations of Triton and Pluto (Stern), as well as several faint comets (Festou), and the Galilean satellites (Nelson and Buratti); the proposed IUE observations of the Uranian satellites are entirely feasible.  The proposed observations will compliment existing Voyager measurements and groundbased observations of Oberon, and will relate to the general study of the Uranian satellite system. Our general scientific objective is to obtain an LWP low-dispersion exposure to document the mid-UV spectrum of Oberon. We will analyze these data: (i) to determine the shape and slope of Oberon's albedo curve in the region 2600-3100 A, (ii) to search for potential UV absorption features indicative of the darkening agent common to the major Uranian satellites, (iii) to extend measurements of Oberon's UV solar-phase angle scattering behavior to below 4 degrees, and (iv) to make comparisons of the UV reflectance properties of Oberon to other planetary satellites already observed by IUE.|Y
SUMRW|UV Variability of the Sun, Uranus and Neptune|Richard|Wagener|Suny Stony Brook|The proposed observations of Uranus and Neptune with IUE address two questions: (1) What are the acetylene abundances in Neptune's and Uranus' stratospheres, the vertical profiles and the solar cycle dependence, and (2) what is the solar irradiance variation in the 1800 A to 2000 A wavelength range. A rocket borne measurement of the solar spectrum will be scheduled to coincide with the IUE observations. The present solar cycle is predicted to attain maximum activity in 1990; IUE spectra of these planets at times of low solar activity were obtained by the proposers and serve as baseline to determine solar variability effects. Acetylene densities will react primarily to the methane dissociating solar Lyman-a flux and have its prime signature in the 1700 to 1800 A range. Longward of these wavelengths, the deep H2 atmospheres of Neptune and Uranus are a close approximation to a purely RayleighRaman scattering atmosphere, for which the albedo can be calculated accurately from first principles. This allows us to deduce the solar flux independently to within IUE calibration precision. A parallel program of laboratory observations of the UV absorption coefficients of C2H2 and other gases obtained under conditions approximating outer planet atmospheres will greatly improve our scientific analysis.|Y
SUNEG|An Ultraviolet Study of Solar Proxies of Different Ages|Edward F.|Guinan|Villanova University|We propose to continue IUE observations of six, single, solar-like stars which have been chosen as proxies for the Sun at ages ranging from ~ 70 Myr to - 9 Gyr. An important factor in their selection was the availability of long term UV observations in the IUE archives, and long term optical photometry. A primary aim a the proposal is to make full use of the archival material in conjunction with fresh IUE observations in order to identify the presence of magnetic activity cycles, in an attempt to understand the evolution of the Sun's activity cycle. We shall also obtain quantitative estimates of the line emission and continuum UV flux of the Sun in time, using these stars as proxies. The UV flux of the young Sun played an important role in the evolution of the planetary atmospheres, and possiblv also in the origin and evolution of life on Earth.|Y
SUOEG|The Past, Present and Future Sun: An IUE Investigation of Solar Proxies|Edward F.|Guinan|Villanova University|We propose to continue IUE observations of a group of single, solar-like stars which have been chosen as proxies for the Sun at ages ranging from ~70 Myr to ~9 Gyr. An important factor in the selection of five of the targets was the availability of long term UV observations in the IUE archives, and long term optical photometry. A primary aim of the program is to make full use of archival IUE material in conjunction with fresh IUE observations in order to identify the presence of magnetic activity cycles, in an attempt to understand the evolution of the Sun's activity cycle. In 1990 and 1991 we also obtained the first IUE observations of HD 44594, the closest spectral match to the Sun so far discovered. In view of the fact that its Mg II emission appears to vary by about 20-30%, we are extending the program to include an additional three stars, which are close analogues of the present Sun, and for which extensive archival IUE data exist. These will be examined to determine to what extent the Sun is typical of stars of its age and spectral type. We shall also obtain quantitative estimates of the line emission and continuum UV flux of the Sun in time, using the target stars as proxies. The UV flux of the young Sun played an important role in the evolution of planetary atmospheres, and possibly also in the origin and evolution of fife on Earth.|Y
SUOJC|H Lyman-Alpha Dayglow Emission Line Profiles from Saturn and Uranus|John T.|Clarke|U Michigan|If the bright H Ly-alpha emissions from the outer planets are due mainly to resonant scattering (RS) of solar and interplanetary emissions, as is suggested on Jupiter and Saturn by IUE-observed long-term correlations with the solar EUV flux, then the lines from all 4 planets must be broad to explain the observed high albedos, Recent IUE observations of Jupiter's H Ly-alpha emission line profile have shown that the equatorial lines are all very broad and lacking any central peak indicative of strong electron excitation. We have been able to model these profiles only by the inclusion of a 5-10 km/sec velocity distribution in addition to thermal motions (although the physical process leading to this additional velocity component has not been identified). We propose here to extend the existing IUE observations of Jupiter with H Ly-alpha line profile measurements of Sarum and Uranus, in part to resolve the questions about the excitation processes and also to explore the possibility that the line broadening process is the source of the observed thermospheric heating.|Y
SUOMM|The Auroral and Dayglow Emissions of Saturn and Uranus|Melissa A.|McGrath|Johns Hopkins University|We propose 15th episode IUE observations of the auroral emissions of Saturn, the dayglow Ly-alpha emission of Saturn and the ultraviolet albedo of both Saturn and Uranus. These emissions are important for understanding the atmospheric energy budgets, which is a basic requirement for understanding atmospheric structure, thermospheric winds, and the importance of auroral heating relative to other heating processes. Our proposed research program seeks to utilize these emissions to help explain the remarkable similarities and tantilizing differences among the outer planets through detailed intercomparisons. The UV albedo measurements of Saturn will be used to characterize for the first time using IUE data the N-S spatial dependence of the albedo, as well as its possible seasonal variation associated with the reemergence of the southern hemisphere from the shadow of the rings, and the long-term temporal variation. Observations of Uranus Ly-alpha covering a 24-hr period will be used to investigate the short-time-scale variability of the auroral emissions, as well as the behavior of the UV albedo.|Y
SUPRK|Supernova Spectroscopy|Robert P.|Kirshner|Harvard CFA - SAO|The ultraviolet study of SN 1987A vividly demonstrates the value of having a target of opportunity program to study supernovae. In 1990, in 1991, and in 1992 thanks to the prompt operation of this Target of Opportunity program, we obtained three valuable series of UV spectra for SN 1990N, SN 1991T, and SN 1992A. Combined with observations made later with HST, this program provides the best UV spectra and interesting insight into the models for exploding white dwarfs. A powerful new set of analytic tools has been developed that allows spectrum synthesis for the UV spectra of supernovae.  Despite these successes, it is clear that the field is not exhausted. The current set of UV data on supernovae is limited, and the objects demonstrate a wide variety of behavior in the UV which needs further study. We propose to use the IUE to obtain spectra of newly-discovered bright supernovae. IUE has the vital advantage over HST that it is easy to introduce new objects into the observing plan, and to move swiftly while the supernova is still bright in the UV. It is important to supernova research to expand the coverage of SN Ia, to examine the varieties of SN Ib spectra and to see the variation in properties for SN II.|Y

SVBHM|The High Resolution Spectrum of Venus|H. Warren|Moos|Johns Hopkins University|The short wavelength spectrograph on the IUE spacecraft will be used to obtain high resolution spectra of Venus. In addition to unambiguously identifying emissions and species, these spectra will allow us to determine the excitation mechanisms of the carbon monoxide fourth positive system emissions from the planet. This information is important for a better understanding of the carbon monoxide--carbon dioxide balance of CO2 planets under the photodissociating effects of solar radiation.|Y
SVCAL|High Resolution Observations of Venus with IUE|Arthur L.|Lane|JPL|It is proposed to use IUE to observe sulfur dioxide absorption on Venus at high spectral resolution during the two greatest elongations of 1980, in order to quantitatively determine the time variation of SO2 in the Venus atmosphere. The data will provide an important check of our understanding of the brightness features being studied by Pioneer Venus. In view of the observed deterioration of the efficiency of IUE's solar panels, the two elongations of 1980 may be the last opportunities to observe Venus from IUE.|Y

SVPHD|The Evolutionary State of SV Centauri|Horst J.|Drechsel|Colorado - JILA|SV Cen (B1V + B6.5III) is one of the most important early-type binaries, though in a so far undetermined evolutionary state. This eclipsing binary exhibits the largest known rate of period decrease P/P = -2.15x10^-5 /yr. Possible explanations are conservative mass transfer at a rate of some 10^-4 Mo/yr from the more to the less massive component in the short-lived phase of rapid mass exchange prior to the reversal of mass ratio, or non-conservative mass exchange in an opposite direction with loss of mass and angular momentum through an outer Lagrangean point. The latter case seems more probable due to the much longer time scale involved, and due to the presence of an expanding circumbinary envelope. Mass loss through an outer Lagrangean point is expected for outer contact systems only, which can easily emerge when radiation pressure effects are taken into account to modify the classical Roche model. Verification of such a situation, which would be of major importance for close binary evolution, could readily be achieved by taking high resolution spectra at the two orbital conjunction phases, which would reveal the origin of mass loss in one of the two outer Lagrangean points.|Y
SWOJN|Simultaneous UV and Optical Study of O Star Winds|Joy|Nichols-Bohlin|CSC - Astronomy Programs|In our search for the origin of the widely observed wind variability in early-type stars, we found that changes in the high-velocity absorption edge of the UV resonance lines in at least one O star are strongly correlated with equivalent width changes in the He II 4686 line at low velocity. We also found that the strength of the Discrete Absorption Components in the UV P Cygni lines correlates with the velocity changes in the high-velocity absorption edge. These results suggest that the variability of the wind, including its DAC's, originates close to the photosphere and that both low- and high-velocity material are present near the stellar surface. Our observations support a shocked-wind model in which rotation is important. It is not clear yet, however, whether the stars in our small sample are representative of all O stars.  We propose to study three O stars which were not included in earlier simultaneous UV and optical campaigns, and to compare their properties with the ones we have studied before, in the hope of deriving generalized conclusions about correlations between wind and (near-) photospheric activity in O stars. The proposed investigation will therefore provide the base for further developments in understanding this fundamental property of early-type stars. |Y
SX2HG|Study of the Ultraviolet Spectra of Selected Galactic X-Ray Sources|Herbert|Gursky|Harvard CFA - SAO|Objective:  (1) Study of peculiarities In UV the spectrum associated with x-ray emission (2) Determination of interstellar absorption to determine distance to the x-ray source (3) Study of the UV continuum to find x-ray related emission (4) Study of the temporal behavior of the UV emission.|Y
SYJDC|Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 Galaxies|D. Michael|Crenshaw|CSC|We propose to obtain ultraviolet and optical spectra of three narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies that have not been observed by the IUE. In the ultraviolet spectra of most Seyfert 1 galaxies, the emission lines are very broad (1000 to 6000 km s^-1 FWHM), and the weak lines are difficult to measure due to blending. However, Osterbrock and Pogge (1985) present an optical study of Seyfert I galaxies in which all of the emission lines have widths that are less than 1000 km s^-1 (FWHM). Two of these Seyferts have been observed by the IUE, but their emission lines likely receive a substantial contribution from the narrow line region (i.e. low density region). Therefore, we would like to obtain SWP and LWP low-dispersion spectra of the three Seyfert galaxies from this study whose emission lines have only a small contribution from the narrowline region.  We would like to obtain relative line intensities of the weak emission lines in the narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies for the following purposes: 1. We will estimate the reddening of the broad-line region (i.e. high density region) from the He II 1640/ He II 4686 ratio.  2. We will investigate the possibility that the broad emission feature at 1909 A is not entirely due to C III].  3. We will estimate the C:N:O abundances from the emission lines of O IV] 1402, N IV] 1486, C IV 1550, O III] 1663, N III] 1750, and C III) 1909.  4. We will identify and measure as many weak emission lines as possible (especially Fe II lines) to determine their effect on the profiles of the broad emission lines of L-alpha, C IV 1550, C III]  1909 (if present), and Mg II 2800.|Y
SYJGR|Search for Rapid UV Variability in the Seyfert 1 NGC 4593|Gail A.|Reichert|CSC|We propose a search for very rapid variations in the short-wavelength (lambda < 2000A) UV continuum of the Seyfert I galaxy NGC 4593, on timescales between 3 and 16 hours. Such rapid UV variability would be a direct test of whether the UV continuum in Seyfert I's has a nonthermal origin or whether it arises via thermal emission from a geometrically thin, optically thick accretion disk around a massive compact object. Very fast variations cannot be accommodated within the framework of viscous accretion disk models, and would tend to favour a nonthermal UV emission mechanism. This type of observation can only be done by IUE. NGC 4593 is an excellent candidate for such a study in view of its history of rapid UV variations (on a timescale of days) and its rapid X-ray variability (on a timescale of hours).|Y
SYJJH|Bright Seyfert 2 Galaxies|Jules P.|Halpern|Columbia University|We propose to observe four bright Seyfert 2 galaxies (NGC 1144, NGC 3362, NGC 3982, and NGC 5674). Together with four other objects already observed with IUE, these data will be used to study the ultraviolet properties of a magnitude limited sample of spectroscopically selected Seyfert 2 galaxies from the CFA redshift survey, which is unbiased with respect to continuum properties. The UV data will be combined with existing radio, infrared, optical, and X-ray data. The primary objective is to determine whether the continuum emission from Seyfert 2 galaxies is generally powered by accretion onto a massive compact object, as appears to be the case in Seyfert I galaxies. The UV data are crucial in the search for an accretion disk spectrum or a nonthermal power law. We will also use the Lyman alpha fluxes to test theoretical modifications of the Case B hydrogen recombination line ratios (and thus modified reddenings) which have been derived specifically for narrow-line regions of Seyfert galaxies. Detections of the various ionization stages of carbon will be used to check models of power-law photoionization and to derive the ionization parameter of the emission-line clouds.|Y
SYLAF|Ultraviolet Observations of NGC 4395, the Least Luminous and Nearest Known Seyfert 1 Nucleus|Alexei V.|Filippenk|University of California|Using the Hale reflector at Palomar Observatory, we have discovered the least luminous known Seyfert I nucleus, in the very nearby (d ~ 2.6 Mpc), late-type (Sd III-IV) galaxy NGC 4395. Seyfert 1 nuclei have never before been seen in galaxies of this Hubble type. The luminosity of the broad (FWZI ~ 7,000 km s^-1) H-alpha emission line is only 0.1 that in M81, until now the least luminous known Seyfert 1. Even broader (FWZI ~ 10,000 km s^-1) He II 4686 is also detected, as are very strong, narrow emission lines spanning a very wide range of ionization. Because the active nucleus is located in a spatially well-resolved galaxy, the nonstellar light is not seriously contaminated by starlight from a galactic bulge. The blue continuum magnitude of the nucleus is -10.1 mag, no more luminous than the brightest single supergiant stars; thus, it is remotely possible that the object itself can be explained by purely stellar phenomena. We propose to obtain SWP and LWP spectra of the nucleus of NGC 4395 with IUE, in order to test this hypothesis and to further explore the unprecedented properties of the nucleus. Study of this unique object, the nearest and least luminous Seyfert I nucleus, should yield important information concerning the general nature of activity in galactic nuclei. Scientific collaboration with Dr. W. L. W. Sargent of the California Institute of Technology, to which we refer in the proposal, will continue throughout the course of the research. Resources that are required by Dr. Sargent are available at CALTECH; no support for Dr. Sargent is being requested in this proposal.|Y
SYMDW|Anisotropic Continuum Emission in Seyferts|D. Mark|Whittle|Virginia|The primary aim of this program is to thoroughly examine the evidence for anisotropic continuum emission in Seyferts. Collimated emission in the classic powerful radio galaxies is generally accepted, but what of the situation for the radio quiet majority? Evidence for anisotropic ionization exists for a few objects e.g. NGC1068. It is clearly important to establish whether this is a general property. We have chosen to work with two complete samples of Seyferts, one distance limited and the other flux limited. We have analyzed the IRAS, Einstein and IUE archive data for these samples under our 1988 ADP proposal. From this initial analysis it is now clear that one of the most important contributions to the project is from IUE observations of Seyfert 2s. Unfortunately, because of their low UV flux, Seyfert 2s have been relatively ignored by IUE observers, leaving an archive which is quite incomplete in comparison to the other wavebands. Using the new extraction techniques, however. we find that Seyfert 2s do yield the continuum flux and slope measurements required for our program. We therefore propose to observe five new nearby Seyfert 2s with IUE. Data on these five will have a significant impact on the UV coverage in our sample, giving us an unbiased distance limited sample which is COMPLETE in Seyfert 2s. Not only will this greatly enhance our study of anisotropic emission in Seyferts, but as a spinoff we will be able to present the first comprehensive study of the UV properties of Seyfert 2 galaxies.|Y
SYOJH|Was 49: Mirror for a Hidden Seyfert 1 Galaxy|Jules P.|Halpern|Columbia University|Was 49 is an interacting pair of Seyfert galaxies at z = 0.063, one of which contains a hidden Seyfert 1nucleus as evidenced by the highly polarized broad wings on its Balmer lines. The disk of the main galaxy appears to be globally photoionized by a powerful continuum source, undoubtedly the hidden Seyfert 1 companion. The intrinsic luminosity is at least 100 times larger than the observed (scattered) luminosity. We propose to obtain a single SWP spectrum of the pair, which can be spatially resolved in the large aperture. We expect to detect narrow Ly-alpha, C IV, and possibly the nonstellar continuum of the hidden Seyfert 1, all of which will help to determine the ionizing continuum spectrum and intrinsic luminosity of the obscured nucleus.|Y
SYOMM|Ultraviolet Spectra of the Complete 12-Micron Seyfert 1 Galaxy Sample|Matthew A.|Malkan|UCLA|We propose to obtain the first SWP spectra of UGC 5101, NGC 3511, and NGC 4602, to complete the coverage of the 121Lm Seyfert I galaxy sample. 12 micron selection provides the best unbiased bolometric flux-limited sample of AGNs (Spinoglio and Malkan 1989). We will also observe MKN 334, completing the SWP coverage of the optically-selected CfA Seyfert is, for comparison with the 12 micron sample. We are now compiling nearly complete multiwavelength space- and ground-based observations for the 12 micron sample. The IUE data will be an essential part of this uniform database, since many of the most important line and continuum features of AGNs fall in the wavelength range of the SWP camera. Statistical analysis of this complete unbiased sample will allow for the testing of models which attempt to explain the wide range of observed AGN properties as resulting from a continuous sequence in a few fundamental parameters In particular, we will test proposed paradigms in which the key parameters are viewing angle, size scale of the central engine, and/or the degree of dust-enshroudedness. This analysis will form the basis of Brian Rush's Ph.D. thesis at UCLA.|Y
SYQSK|Ultraviolet Observations of Accretion in Two Symbiotic Stars|Scott|Kenyon|CFA - SAO|We propose to acquire IUE observations of two symbiotic binaries - CI Cyg and AX Per - over a complete orbital cycle. Our previous studies of these systems - using archival IUE data - showed that accretion from a lobe-filling red giant primary star powers the hot component in both systems. The disks in these binaries appear to be optically thin during quiescence and optically thick in an eruption; the boundary layer between the inner edge of the disk and the star ionizes a surrounding H II region during quiescence, and this luminosity first increases and then fades dramatically in outburst.  New UV observations of CI Cyg will allow us to follow the evolution of a quiescent disk and boundary layer around a complete orbit for the first time in any symbiotic system. New UV observations of AX Per will enable us to study the decline from its 1987 eruption and compare our results to those we inferred from the decline of CI Cyg.  We received 2 US2 shifts for episode 16 to cover the start of the CI Cyg eclipse in 1994. This proposal requests time to finish this eclipse and observe the AX Per eclipse in late 1994.|Y
TBOTS|Convection, Granulation, and Thermal Bifurcation in the A Stars|Theodore|Simon|U Hawaii|The galactic neighborhood of the Sun has a deficiency in the number of main sequence stars of spectral type A relative to those of types B and F. Bohm-Vitense has suggested that this scarcity of A stars is due to the sudden onset of convection near B - V = 0.22, which acts to shift stars toward a redder B - V color and a later spectral type. The result is a large jump in B - V at nearly constant effective temperature through the middle of the A stars - hence the "A star gap". According to Bohm-Vitense, the spectroscopic changes induced by convection are limited to visible wavelengths, but are negligible at UV wavelengths. This provides the basis for a straightforward test of her hypothesis, which we propose to carry out. Our program involves narrow band (10-20 A) spectrophotometry of a large sample of A stars in the 1800-2200 A region, which takes advantage of the high sensitivity and internal photometric accuracy of IUE, as well as the extreme temperature sensitivity of this part of the spectral energy distribution of A-F stars. A comparison of the observe UV fluxes with B - V colors and with model atmosphere predictions should provide a definitive test. In addition, using the same data, we also seek to confirm the existence of a temperature bifurcation among the A stars, which Bohm-Vitense has deduced from narrowband UV photometry taken by the TD-1 spacecraft.|Y
TEPNE|Temperatures for Stars with Accurate Masses and Radii|Nancy Remage|Evans|ISTS - York University|Recently, a major observational effort particularly by the group led by J. Andersen has been directed to obtaining accurate velocity curves and light curves for detached double-line eclipsing binary systems. This has enabled them to determine masses and radii for stars in 45 binary systems with an accuracy of 2%. Data this accurate can be used to calibrate relations such as the zero age main sequence mass-luminosity relation, and to investigate questions such as the importance of convective overshoot on the upper main sequence. However, this impressive improvement in fundamental parameters cannot be fully utilized (in, for instance, a mass-luminosity relation) without improved temperatures, particularly for upper main sequence stars. In this project we propose to use IUE spectra to determine temperatures for at least the primary of 26 binary systems with a component of spectral type A3 V or earlier. IUE low resolution spectra are very temperature sensitive for stars of these spectral types, and ideally suited for determining temperatures by comparison with Kurucz model atmospheres.|Y

TOQSS|Coordinated Multiwavelength Observations of Classical and Recurrent Novae in Outburst|Sumner|Starrfield|Arizona State University|This proposal was originally approved for 3 years in the 16th Episode Review. We propose to continue observing Galactic and Magellanic Cloud classical or recurrent novae in outburst with IUE. Any Galactic nova brighter than about V ~ 8, or LMC or SMC nova brighter than V ~ 12 will be considered as a Target of Opportunity for this proposal. We will concentrate on obtaining as complete coverage as possible of the early (pre-UV maximum) spectral development and observe less frequently as the nova evolves into the nebular stage. We place special emphasis on Magellanic Cloud novae since they also serve as calibrators of absolute properties of the outbursts. UV spectra, appropriately spaced in time through the nova's active period and decline, provide measurements of the formation and lifting of the iron curtain, the shift of the peak of the emitted radiation into the UV, the absorption and emission line strengths, the kinematics of the ejecta, and are sensitive to dust formation. The UV data will be combined with contemporaneous ground based optical, IR, X-ray, and radio observations, to be obtained as part of this project. Because most of the energy radiated by a nova during its outburst is in the UV and EUV and because there are emission lines in the UV from ions that do not radiate in the optical, the IUE is absolutely necessary for the study of the outburst. In addition, IUE is the only UV satellite capable of the rapid scheduling changes necessary to observe a nova during the iron curtain stage of the outburst.|Y
TORDG|Tomography and Colliding Winds of O-Type Binaries: Filling the Gaps|Douglas R.|Gies|Georgia State University|We propose to obtain IUE high dispersion SWP spectra of 18 early-type binary systems to supplement the orbital phase coverage of existing archival spectra. The observations axe part of a large survey of the evolutionary and wind properties of O-type binaries. We will use a Doppler tomography algorithm to reconstruct the individual component photospheric spectra to determine spectral types, luminosity classes, UV magnitude difference, and projected rotational velocities, and to search for evidence of abundance anomalies. We will also analyze the orbital phase related variations in the P Cygni stellar wind lines to search for evidence of colliding winds. The results will yield important new constraints on the evolutionary status and mass loss properties of these systems.|Y

TTBCI|Ultraviolet Observations of Pre-Main Sequence Stars|Catherine L.|Imhoff|Arizona|It is proposed that the observations of the T Tauri stars be continued and expanded to cover a variety of related pre-main sequence objects. The kinds of stars included are T Tauri stars with various spectral characteristics, Herbig Ae-Be stars of differing emission line strengths, and the eruptive variables FU Orionis and V1057 Cygni. In addition to the low resolution, long wavelength observations that are possible for these faint stars, shorter wavelength and higher resolution observations should be attempted for a selected few stars. These observations can give invaluable information concerning the emission region near the stars which is responsible for their ultraviolet excesses and emission lines.|Y
TTBGH|Ultraviolet Spectroscopy of T Tauri Stars|George H.|Herbig|UC Santa Cruz|IUE observations of three bright T Tauri stars are proposed, to investigate: (a) a possible rise in the excitation/ionization level of the emission spectrum below 3000 A, which bears on atmospheric models; (b) the nature of the veiling continuum which is strong in two of these objects; (c) the possible rise in the energy distribution at short wavelengths which may be expected with the chromospheric models. The IUE observations will be tied in with simultaneous UBV and scanner observations from the earth's surface.|Y
TTCCI|Ultraviolet Observations of Pre-Main Sequence Emission-Line Stars|Catherine L.|Imhoff|Arizona|It is proposed that IUE observations continue on the T Tauri and Herbig Ae stars. There are three objectives: (1) complete studies of three T Tauri stars of differing characteristics, to encompass the entire wavelength range at low resolution and the MgII emission lines at high resolution; (2) high dispersion observations of two Herbig Ae stars of moderate and extreme behavior; and (3) an extension of our sample of T Tauri stars observed with short exposure times during Shift 2 to get MgII emission line fluxes. Our observations to date indicate that these, with coordinated ground based observations, would allow a further examination of the ultraviolet variability, the nature of the ultraviolet excess and peculiar extinction, temperature range and physical extent of the emitting region, and formation of the strong MgII emission lines in these pre-main sequence stars.|Y

TTDMG|High Dispersion, Long Wavelength Studies of T Tauri Stars|Mark S.|Giampapa|CFA|We propose to obtain high dispersion, high quality, long wavelength spectra as well as some low dispersion, short wavelength spectra for a sample of T Tauri stars. The data to be obtained in this program will be supplemented with ground-based, high spectral resolution optical observations to be acquired simultaneously with the IUE observations. These data will be used for a comprehensive study of the structure, energy balance, velocity fields and mass loss rates that characterize the atmospheres of T Tauri stars. More specifically, we will develop semi-empirical models for the chromospheres and transition regions of specific T Tauri stars in order to parameterize the atmospheres Of these pre-main sequence objects and to attempt to discover why the T Tauri stars do not obey the Wilson-Bappu relation.|Y
TTECI|The Development of Chromospheres & Coronae in the T Tauri Stars|Catherine L.|Imhoff|CSC|The T Tauri stars represent a normal stage in the pre-main sequence evolution of solar-mass stars. Ultraviolet observations have revealed the presence of strong Mg II h and k lines, ultraviolet excesses, and far-ultraviolet emission lines indicative of dense, active chromospheres (Appenzeller and Wolf 1979, Appenzeller et al. 1980, Brown et al. 1981, Gahm et al. 1979, Giampapa et al. 1981, Gondhalekar et al. 1979, Imhoff and Giampapa 1980, 1981). The surface fluxes of the transition region lines equal and exceed those of any other late-type star (Imhoff and Giampapa 1980, 1981). However only about one third of the T Tauri stars have been detected by Einstein (Feigelson and DeCampli 1981, Gahm 1980, Walter and Kuhi 1981). The low X-ray flux, relative to the far-ultraviolet lines, in some of the stars may be due to absorption of the X-rays in dense gas shells (Gahm 1980, Walter and Kuhi 1981). On the other hand, a relative weakening of the higher temperature far-ultraviolet emission lines may signal that the T Tauri atmosphere does not reach coronal temperatures in those stars, perhaps due to higher chromospheric densities or to the effects of mass loss (Imhoff and Giampapa 1981, 1982).  If there are indeed T Tauri stars with and without coronae, then we may be witnessing the birth of the corona sometime during the T Tauri stage. It would be of great interest to study the development of the chromosphere and corona during the evolution of a protostar and to detail the processes that affect its evolution.  We propose to study this evolution through the T Tauri stage with IUE. We would like to observe a selection of X-ray bright and faint T Tauri stars. Concurrently we will perform ground-based scanner observations to obtain Ca II fluxes for these variable stars. We have chosen the targetted stars carefully on the basis of known surface temperatures, luminosities, extinction, distance, X-ray results, and vsini's. we wish to derive information on the density and temperature structure of the atmosphere, the effects of mass loss, relations with stellar rotation and magnetic fields, and the genesis and evolution of the chromosphere and corona.|Y
TTELK|The Ultraviolet Excess in T Tauri Stars|Leonard V.|Kuhi|UC Berkeley|One of the puzzling properties of T Tauri stars is that some of them show extreme emission properties which totally mask the photospheric spectrum and the excess emission increases as one goes to shorter wavelengths. Some of this emission may be due to hydrogen bound-free and free-free processes, but some of its characteristics may not be fully explained by this. Recent theoretical calculations have shown that two photon emission may be important, and observed correlations and wavelength extents also suggest a correlation with line blanketing. It would be important to our rather poor understanding of these strange stars and the likely envelope of mass loss activity that surrounds them if we could understand their UV continuum. Because the continuum emission masks most of the normal diagnostics, it offers the best chance to discover what these stars really are. Additionally, the IUE offers the chance of gaining information on circumstellar and interstellar extinction for these objects, which has heretofore been impossible because of the anomalous nature of their spectrum.|Y
TTFJL|High Dispersion Study of Two T Tauri Stars: RU Lupi and Cod-34 7151|Jeffrey L.|Linsky|Colorado - JILA|High dispersion, short wavelength IUE spectra with exposure times of 16 hours or more are sought for the two T Tauri stars which are brightest in the ultraviolet, RU Lupi and CoD-34 7151. These spectra will provide vital information on emission line profiles and widths for resonance and intersystem lines formed at temperatures between 2xlO^4 and 2xlO^5 K. These data can then be used to examine the energy deposition processes present in the chromospheres and transition regions of these stars. In particular, the Alfven wave-powered wind-outflow model proposed by Lago (1979, 1982) can be tested in terms of its proposed velocity and density structure. The relative importance of turbulence, opacity and Doppler shifts in an outflowing wind as line broadening mechanisms will be investigated for these stars. Low resolution IUE spectra of T Tauri stars indicate that RU Lupi and CoD-34 7151 are the only members of this class for which such observations are possible with IUE.|Y
TTGJL|High Dispersion Line Profile Studies of TW HYA and Other Pre-Main Sequence Stars|Jeffrey L.|Linsky|Colorado - JILA|We propose to extend our study of line profiles in T Tauri stars by obtaining a 16 hour SWP-HI spectrum of TW Hya and 6-8 hour LWP-HI spectra of TW Hya, AK Sco, CoD -35 10525 and CoD -33 10685. High dispersion spectra of pre-main sequence (PMS) stars provide unique information on line widths, shifts, and asymmetries, as well as evidence for mass outflow, circumstellar absorption, and diagnostics for the temperature structure of the outer atmosphere layers of these complex yet incredibly important objects. We have previously obtained and studied line profiles in RU Lupi and the prototype star T Tau. RU Lupi has line profiles that are dominated by the wind expansion, for example the MgII and FeII multiplet UV1 profiles are unique in that they have a classical P Cygni shape, whereas T Tau has more symmetric emission profiles indicative of a chromosphere and hotter layers not dominated by expansion. TW Hya is different from these two previously studied stars in that it may be the brightest known example of a post-T Tauri star, and hence less active and older than the other PMS stars. We intend to compare its line profiles with those of RU Lupi and T Tauri in order to understand the differences in the non-thermal mass motions, wind expansion, and thermal structures of these three very different T Tau stars. The requested LWPHI spectra are to obtain MgII and FeII multiplet UV1. profiles of 4 different T Tauri objects so as to infer the expansion and thermal structure in their chromospheric layers.|Y
TTHGB|Chromospheric Activity in Solar Mass Pre-Main Sequence Stars|Gibor S.|Basri|Berkeley|The T Tauri stars represent the first time during a young star's evolution that we can directly observe its surface. We find that it is covered by extreme activity with far-UV emission lines 3 orders of magnitude stronger than in the quiet sun. These stars also seem to be going through a phase of relatively strong mass loss. Previous studies with the IUE have begun to constrain physical conditions on the stellar surface and have been very helpful in starting to disentangle surface emission from wind emission. IUE programs have concentrated on the brightest targets, however, and we have begun to understand that these may be misleading objects with which to study chromospheric activity in its early phases as many of the emission line diagnostics may be formed in the wind rather than near the stellar surface. This proposal concentrates on looking at a more "normal" set of targets to measure their Mg II and UV continuum emission concurrently with a full set of optical observations at similar resolution. It therefore extends the crucial effort to obtain data suitable for the construction of physical model atmospheres to the stars most representative of the early evolution of stellar chromospheres.|Y
TTHJL|The Ultraviolet Spectrum of the T Tauri Star RY TAU Subsequent to its 1983 Brightening|Jeffrey L.|Linsky|Colorado - JILA|We propose to obtain new SWP-LO and LWP-HI spectra of the T Tauri star, RY Tauri. This irregular, pre-main sequence variable has recently visually brightened by about 1^m.5 to its brightest level in 20 years due, most probably, to an increase in its photospheric temperature. In this proposal, we seek to elucidate the effect of this dramatic brightening on the chromosphere, transition region, and wind of this star by comparison of new UV data with those obtained before and at the onset of its visual rise. We will compare, for all detected lines, pre- and post-outburst measured emission fluxes and inferred emission measures, and, for the Mg II resonance lines in the LWP-HI spectra, make a detailed comparison of "before" and "after" line profile morphologies, in order to find variations in the mass loss rate and terminal velocity of the wind of this star. So as to extend the timeline of UV observations of RY Tau and also so as to help separate short- and long-term variability effects, we request that the observations be scheduled at two epochs six months apart.|Y
TTIFW|Post T Tauri and Naked T Tauri Stars|Frederick M.|Walter|Colorado - CASA|The behavior of the stellar activity on very young low mass stars as they evolve from being newly-emerged T Tauri stars to the ZAMS is not yet understood. Low mass main sequence stars older than ~ 10^8 yrs are well studied, as are T Tauri stars (T ~ 10^6 yrs). However, a significant fraction of the "activity" in T Tauri stars may not be solar-like, but instead the result of emission from a circumstellar envelope and massive wind. We propose to study the decay of stellar activity with age for stars of ages 2-20 x 10^6 yrs, using a sample of "naked" T Tauri and post T Tauri stars. Measurements of a selected sample of these PMS, non-T Tauri stars will permit us to choose between power law and exponential decay models for the decay of the transition region and chromospheric emission. Construction of atmospheric models based on chromospheric transition region fluxes will permit us to study the atmospheric structure of stars on radiative evolutionary tracks. Comparison with T Tauri stars will reveal how much of the T Tauri activity is solar-like (coming from a compact chromosphere/TR), and how much arises in the low density circumstellar envelope.|Y
TTIJL|Continued Long-Term Ultraviolet Monitoring of RY TAU|Jeffery L.|Linsky|Colorado|We propose to continue our variability study of the T Tauri star RY Tau and to establish this study as an IUE long term project. We want to obtain new SWP-LO, LWP-HI and LWP-LO spectra at two epochs each year. Our aim is to investigate the relationship between variability seen in ultraviolet line fluxes and profiles, originating in the star's chromosphere, transition region and wind, and the variability seen in optical photometry and spectroscopy. This investigation will show which of the several proposed variability mechanisms are actually occurring in the case of RY Tau. Our previous observations have already shown that some of the variability is due to changes in the fractional area coverage of dark star spots/UV-bright active regions and also that significant changes occur in the wind from RY Tau. RY Tau is now one of the brightest T Tauri stars and is presently the PMS star exhibiting the most extreme optical variability. RY Tau therefore also offers the best opportunity of understanding the variability of T Tauri stars in general.|Y
TTITS|Chromospheric Activity on a T Tauri Star|Theodore|Simon|Hawaii|The ultraviolet spectra of T Tauri stars exhibit strong chromospheric and transition region emission lines whose intrinsic Surface fluxes are the largest among all classes of chromospherically active stars. Although the T Tauri stars are wellknown spectrum variables, no evidence has yet been found for a periodic modulation of the UV spectrum of any T Tauri star due to rotation. However, until very recently the rotation periods of T Tauri stars were unknown, and consequently the UV observations Could not be phased properly. Rotation periods are now available for nearly a dozen T Tauri stars from UBVRI photometry, which has led to the discovery of quasi-sinusoidal light variations not unlike those observed for spotted BY Dra and RS CVn stars. If these variations of the T Tauri stars are the result of organized surface activity, in the form of isolated active regions or complexes of activity, the strengths of the UV emission lines should be correlated with the phases of the visible light curves of the stars. Therefore, I am proposing here to look for evidence of rotational modulation in the IUE spectrum of a star of known rotation period, whose UV observations can be phased against simultaneous UBV photometry and spectrophotometry. The importance of periodic variability in a subset of T Tauri stars lies in the fact that this may represent the earliest development of solar-like activity patterns on the surfaces of young stars; therefore, it is important to establish whether the periodicity and organized structure is present in the higher as well as deeper layers of the stellar atmosphere.|Y
TTJAB|Continued Ultraviolet Monitoring of RY TAU|Alexander|Brown|Colorado - JILA|We propose to continue our variability study of the T Tauri star RY Tau, which now contains data extending over a 7 year period. We want to obtain new SWP-LO, LWP-HI and LWP-LO spectra at two epochs during the 10th year of IUE. Our aim is to investigate the relationship between variability seen in ultraviolet line fluxes and profiles, originating in the star's chromosphere, transition region and wind, and the variability seen in optical photometry and spectroscopy. This investigation will show which of the several proposed variability mechanisms are actually occurring in the case of RY Tau. our previous observations have already shown that some of the variability is due to changes in the fractional area coverage of dark star spots/UVbright active regions and also that significant changes occur in the wind from RY Tau. During 1986 March a sudden one magnitude drop in V magnitude was observed and at this time the MgII flux decreased by 30% and the MgII wind absorption feature disappeared. Such events are not infrequent for RY Tau and our data show clearly that they are due to sudden increases in circumstellar extinction (at least in March 1986 anyway). RY Tau is now one of the brightest T Tauri stars and is presently the PMS star exhibiting the most extreme optical variability. RY Tau therefore also offers the best opportunity of understanding the variability of T Tauri stars in general.|Y
TTJFW|Naked T Tauri Stars|Frederick M.|Walter|Colorado - CASA|The behavior of the stellar activity on very young low mass stars as they evolve from being newly-emerged T Tauri stars to the ZAMS is not well understood. Low mass main sequence stars older than ~10^8 yrs are well studied, as are T Tauri stars (T ~ 10^6 yrs). However, a significant fraction of the "activity" in T Tauri stars may not be solar-like, but instead the result of emission from circumstellar material, including accretion disks and massive winds. We propose to study the decay of stellar activity with age for stars of ages 1-40 x 10^6 yrs, using a sample of "naked" T Tauri stars. Measurements of a selected sample of these PMS, non-T Tauri stars will permit us to choose between power law and exponential decay models for the decrease in transition region and chromospheric emission with age. Construction of atmospheric models based on transition region fluxes will permit us to study the atmospheric structure of stars on radiative evolutionary tracks. Comparison with T Tauri stars may reveal how much of the T Tauri activity is solar-like (coming from a compact chromosphere/TR), and how much arises in the low density circumstellar envelope.|Y
TTKAB|Chromospheric TR Region Variability of T Tauri Stars|Alexander|Brown|Colorado - JILA|We propose to investigate the mechanisms causing the observed photospheric, chromospheric and transition region variability of T Tauri stars using contemporaneous ultraviolet, optical and infrared observations. We are planning a 10-12 day observational campaign that would have IUE low dispersion observations using both cameras as its centrepiece. No observing campaign lasting for such a period and including transition region diagnostics has every occurred previously. In order to achieve such a campaign we are combining our resources and submitting this collaborative (consortium) IUE proposal. Our aim is to obtain SWP and LWP low dispersion data for our three primary target, RY Tau, DR Tau and DF Tau. These stars have previously displayed most of the types of atmospheric variability shown by T Tauri stars (e.g. rotational modulation, circumstellar extinction changes, infall and wind variability), but of course in the past have not been monitored in the UV for anything like the proposed amount of time, and so the evolution of the variability has not been followed well. An additional four stars, V410 Tau, HDE283572, AA Tau and DN Tau, all of which have known rotational periods, will be observed in US2 time for Mg II rotational modulation.|Y

TTKGB|Accretion Disks and T Tauri Stars|Gibor|Basri|Berkeley|The T Tauri stars represent the first time during a young star's evolution that we can directly observe its surface. They display extreme activity with far-UV emission lines up to 3 orders of magnitude stronger than in the quiet sun. There is increasing evidence that circumstellar disks remain around the classical T Tauri stars. These are manifested through infrared excesses which both cannot be easily explained any other way and can be easily explained with simple disk models. In a number of systems, the bolometric luminosity is substantially higher than the best estimate of what can be produced by the star: the best explanation is that accretion luminosity is still being produced in the disk. If so, there might be a violent boundary layer at the interface between the disk and star which can produce as much luminosity as the infrared excess from the disk, but in the ultraviolet. Is this be the source of some or all of the ultraviolet and emission line activity associated with T Tauri stars? Our research with previous IUE observations has strongly supported this possibility, providing a major leap in the understanding of young stars. The biggest remaining ambiguity arises because there is also strong magnetic activity on these stars. If the boundary layer model is relevant, there should be correlated variations between the excess UV and IR emission measured at the same time; this would not be the case if classical chromospheres supply the UV luminosity. We propose a direct test of whether accretion is the explanation for many of the spectral peculiarities of classical T Tauri stars using coordinated UV, visible, and infrared observations. We also extend our ground-breaking research on T Tauri accretion begun last year.|Y
TTKKB|Collimated Outflows from T Tauri Stars|Karl-Heinz|Bohm|Washington|Recent observations of T Tauri stars show that in some cases the optical emission line profiles indicate the presence of a collimated wind. This result shows that the collimation of the stellar wind (which has to take place. e. g.. in order to produce observed collimated outflows such as jets and Herbig-Haro objects) at least in some cases takes place very close to the star  in apparent disagreement with prediction,, from the currently more popular models.  We propose to obtain high resolution, short wavelength IUE spectra in order to see whether or not the higher ionization emission lines present in the SWP wavelength range also imply the presence of a collimated outflow. These emission lines (formed in regions of higher ionization than the optical lines) give us the possibility of observing regions of the stellar outflow closer to the star. An analysis of the degree of collimation of the stellar wind in a region closer to the star will provide important constraints on the possible stellar wind collimation models.|Y
TTLGB|Accretion Disks and T Tauri Stars|Gibor S.|Basri|Berkeley|The T Tauri stars represent the first time during a young star's evolution that we can directly observe its surface. There is increasing evidence that circumstellar disks remain around the classical T Tauri stars. These are manifested through infrared excesses which both cannot be easily explained any other way and can be easily explained with simple disk models. In the event the disk is still accreting onto the star, there might be a violent boundary layer at the interface between the disk and star which can produce as much luminosity as the infrared excess from the disk, but in the ultraviolet. Is this the source of some or all of the ultraviolet and emission line activity associated with T Tauri stars? Our research with previous IUE observations has strongly supported this possibility, providing a major leap in the understanding of young stars. The biggest remaining ambiguity arises because there is also strong magnetic activity on these stars. If the boundary layer model is relevant, there should be correlated variations between the excess UV and IR emission measured at the same time; this would not be the case if classical chromospheres supply the UV luminosity. Our recent Work on optically thin boundary layers suggests that the UV variations due to chromospheres and boundary layers will produce different veiling effects as well. We propose to extend the number of disks studied, and to make a direct test of whether accretion is the explanation for many of the spectral peculiarities of classical T Tauri stars using coordinated UV, visible, and infrared observations. This proposal is a continuation of last year's proposal for which the main criticism by the peer review panel was that it should have been a 2-year proposal!|Y
TTMSK|HE II Emission in T Tauri Stars|Scott J.|Kenyon|Harvard SAO - CFA|If He II emission in T Tauri stars arises from recombination, the line fluxes constrain the flux of high energy photons emitted by young stars, and the line ratios provide an estimate of the extinction to several objects with peculiar energy distributions. We propose to obtain nearly simultaneous measurements of He II 1640,4686 emission lines in BP Tau, where the reddening is well-known, to determine if the intensity ratio is consistent with case B recombination. If, as we expect, the line ratio is consistent with recombination, will we use our observations of DR Tau to provide the first direct estimate of the luminosity of a star thought to be rapidly accreting.|Y
TTNTS|The Ultraviolet Variability of BP Tauri|Theodore|Simon|U Hawaii|BP Tau is a weak T Tau star whose photometric brightness varies with a nearly 7.6 day period at visible wavelengths. In October 1986, the 1700 - 3200 A continuum emission of BP Tau was discovered to vary in phase with these changes in optical brightness, while the Mg II lines were observed to vary on a longer, possibly 15-day timescale. Variations were also seen in the high temperature emission lines below 2000 A, which might also be periodic with the optical light curves, but the very limited phase coverage of these IUE observations makes it impossible to be certain.  In this proposal I am requesting time to reobserve BP Tau with much better phase coverage in order to confirm the timescale of variability of the UV continuum, the Mg II lines, and the high-temperature emission lines of C II C IV, and Si IV. These data will help to distinguish between quasi-steady state accretion disk models, whose characteristic timescale is the (12 hour) Keplerian rotation period of the boundary layer, and a magnetodynamic accretion model, whose characteristic timescale is the (7 day) stellar rotation period. In the former case, variability should occur predominantly on the timescale of several hours, while in the latter it should occur on timescales of close to one week.|Y

TTOPS|Target of Opportunity: TT Crt and YY Dra at Outburst|Paula A.|Szkody|U Washington|We will use IUE in a Target of Opportunity mode to obtain time-resolved IUE spectra of the two dwarf novae TT Crt and YY Dra during one of their outbursts. The major aims are an understanding of the influence of the magnetic field on the dwarf novae outbursts of the proposed DQ Her system YY Dra in relation to outbursts of other DQ Her systems (GK Per and TV Col) and of the peculiar abundances/excitation of the dwarf nova TT Crt as evidenced in quiescent spectra. If this latter system has "normal" dwarf novae outburst spectra, the phase-resolved changes of the P Cygni profiles of the C and N lines should provide insight on the proposed stream-overflow situation in this long period system.|Y
TTPFW|Atmospheric Structures in Naked T Tauri Strs|Frederick M.|Walter|SUNY - Stony Brook|We propose to investigate atmospheric structure of low mass pre-main sequence stars. Most investigations to date have concentrated on the classical T Tauri stars, whose UV emissions are dominated by their accretion disks and boundary layers. These stars tell us little about the state of the stellar chromosphere and transition region.  We have ROSAT PSPC time to obtain coronal spectra of 2 naked T Tauri stars scheduled in the spring of 1993. We request time to obtain simultaneous SWP-LO spectra, to build up an emission measure diagram from the lower chromosphere through the corona. Simultaneity is crucial because stellar coronae and transition regions vary. We will determine the one-dimensional atmospheric structure of these stars, for comparison with both active stars on the main sequence and with the classical T Tauri stars.|Y
TTQCI|Star Formation in the Taurus-Auriga Dark Clouds II|C. L.|Imhoff|CSC  Science Programs|We propose to survey a prototypical low-mass star-formation region, the Taurus-Auriga dark clouds, with IUE. It is feasible to obtain IUE data down to specific limiting magnitudes for the various classes of objects (T Tauri stars, "weak" T Tauri stars, Herbig Ae/Be stars). The data would include far-ultraviolet emission line fluxes, Mg II fluxes, and long-wavelength UV "continuum" spectra in order to study chromospheric emission, winds, and disks. In order to pursue this statistical approach, we need to obtain additional IUE observations to counter the current archival bias toward the brighter, more massive, less typical PMS stars. This avenue is essential to establish the generality of studies of individual objects and to find trends and correlations among the stars involving differences in age, angular momentum, and mass.  New and archival IUE data will be combined with satellite and ground-based data in all wavelength regimes for statistical analysis. We will examine the indicators of various phenomena (chromospheres, winds, disks), study their occurence in the various classes of pre-main sequence stars in Taurus-Auriga, correlate them when possible to luminosity, spectral type, mass, or rotation, and determine how these phenomena influence or are influenced by this phase of stellar evolution.|Y
TUORP|A Study of Surface Carbon Depletion in the Mass Algol System TU MON|Ronald S.|Polidan|NASA/GSFC|TU Mon is an Algol binary system with a 5.05 day period and is composed of a B5Vnn (12.6 Me) primary star plus an A5 (2.7 M(sun)) companion star. A weakly exposed IUE low dispersion SWP eclipse spectrum, obtained in 1991, showed that there is a significant deficiency of carbon (no detectable C emission) in the circumstellar matter in this binary system. Such carbon depletion is the expected consequence of mass transfer in massive, Mtotal > 15 M(sun), binary systems. We propose to obtain one well exposed, low resolution SWP exposure of TU Mon during the total primary eclipse phase, in order to determine the strength of any carbon emission, search for any non-stellar UV continuum, and investigate the photosphere of the A5 mass losing star for the presence of the C I 1657 line. In addition we propose to obtain one high dispersion SWP exposure of TU Mon out of eclipse in order to study the B star's continuum, surface abundances, rotation, wind, and reddening. We also request additional time to obtain out of eclipse spectra of four second priority systems included in our 1990 study to support the interpretation of eclipse data.|Y
UGOES|The Cooling of the White Dwarf in U Gem|Edward M.|Sion|Villanova University|We propose to utilize four sets of small aperture low resolution IUE spectra of U Geminorum during dwarf nova quiescence to measure the amount of cooling of the white dwarf in response to the accretion heating resulting from its dwarf nova outburst. Our measurement of the white dwarf temperature at one week, 5 weeks and 9 weeks and 14 weeks into the quiescent interval will be compared to a hydrodynamic simulation of the U Gem dwarf nova accretion event for two physically distinct accretion geometries: (a) tangential accretion (with inclusion of angular momentum/ shear mixing) at the white dwarf equatorial region and (b) radial accretion with inclusion of the accretion luminosity directed inward at the surface. This confrontation between theory and observation will provide new insights into the physics of accretion via disks and address the extent and depth of boundary layer heating, distribution of accretion energy; conversion of rotational kinetic energy into heat; how much of that heat is re-radiated instantaneously; how of it much goes into lifting (expanding) the envelope; how much of it is radiated back out on a longer timescale. The high signal-to-noise spectra will enable a comprehensive investigation of elemental abundances in a freshly accreted white dwarf photosphere and the physical processes which control/modify the flow of accreted elements.|Y

URPMM|Variability of Uranian Lyman Alpha Emission|Melissa A.|McGrath|STScI|Uranus emits 1-2kR of highly variable Ly-alpha emission that is readily observable by IUE and provides one of the few sources of remote sensing information currently available. IUE 15th episode observations covering ~one complete Uranus rotation (17.24-hr period), combined with a similar set of observations from 1982, give some indication of periodicity at ~1/2 the planetary rotation period, providing the first possible indication for a source(s) of Ly-alpha fixed in longitude. Sixteenth episode observations covering more than one rotation are requested to confirm or refute this possibility, which is impossible given the existing data. A component of Ly-alpha emission fixed in longitude would be consistent with auroral emission, and would give IUE the unprecedented capability of providing information about auroral processes on three of the outer planets, Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus. A complementary approach will to be observe simultaneously the newlydiscovered near-IR H3+ ionospheric emissions, which can be done at adequate spatial resolution to separate a localized aurora. An increase in Ly-alpha emission accompanied by a local H3+ enhancement would provide conclusive evidence for UV Ly-alpha auroral activity.|Y
USOAK|Ultraviolet Spectra of Normal Spiral Galaxies|Anne L.|Kinney|STScI|We propose to observe the centers of 8 of the brightest face-on, or nearly face-on, normal spiral galaxies with the IUE with the goal of typifying the UV spectra of these galaxies as a function of Hubble types Sa, Sb, Sc, Sd, and Irr. A thorough search of the IUE archives shows that while galaxies with various forms of activity have been extensively observed, the centers of normal spiral galaxies have hardly been observed at all - and the existing spectra have only moderate signal-to-noise ratio.  The spectra we will take will be combined with existing UV spectra and with optical spectra in a matched aperture size to produce template spectra which will span a wavelength range from 1200 to 7800A. These template spectra will be used to address (1) the relation between normal spiral galaxies and active galaxies, (2) the relation between the centers of normal spiral galaxies and elliptical galaxies, (3) the differences in stellar populations present in the various Hubble types, (4) the contribution to the diffuse UV background from normal spiral galaxies, and (5) the classification of high redshift galaxies.|Y

UUPRK|Ultraviolet Observations of the Cataclysmic Variable UU Aqr|Ronald H.|Kaitchuck|Ball State University|UU Aqr is an eclipsing cataclysmic variable of the novalike subclass. As such, it is expected to have UV line emission from a wind in addition to emission from the accretion disk and other possible sources. This study will attempt first to disentangle the UV contributions of these sources to learn more about the structure of the binary and its wind, and second to compare this CV to the available archival data on novalikes.|Y
UVODW|Studies of Unusual Far-UV Extinction|Daniel E.|Welty|U Chicago|Although interstellar dust is presumably made up of elements depleted ("missing") from the interstellar gas, existing studies seem to indicate only weak correlations between depictions and measures of extinction. Those studies, however, used average line-of-sight abundances, so that any cloud-to-cloud variations would likely have been masked. Comparing the interstellar extinction and abundances in lines of sight dominated by clouds characterized by extremes in either might illuminate the relationship between the two. Recent work has indicated some correlations between extremes in far-UV extinction and the relative abundances of molecules and of neutral atomic species having high ionization potentials (S I, C I). Examination of a large sample of such lines of sight may enable the effects of depletion and radiation field (and the grain scattering properties) upon the ionization balance and chemistry to be disentangled. High-resolution optical and UV spectra have been obtained for ~30 lines of sight characterized by either very steep or very shallow far-UV extinction; UV extinction curves are needed for several of those stars. Similarly, lines of sight dominated by clouds for which normally depleted elements are present in much larger quantities. and in which the grains have presumably been disrupted, might show anomalous extinction as well; several such lines of sight have been identified. Identification and quantification of these effects will be significant for models of interstellar clouds.|Y

VAOPS|Disk Precession in the Magnetic Old Nova V603 Aql|Paula A.|Szkody|U Washington|We have discovered that the old nova V603 Aql has four periods (2.5 days, 3.5 hrs, 3.3 hrs and 61.4 min) and is thus the brightest known DQ Her type magnetic cataclysmic variable and a member of the small class of binary systems with a precessing accretion disk. We propose joint ESA/USA continuous multiwavelength (optical, IUE, ROSAT) observations of V603 Aql over the entire 2.5 day period of its accretion disc precession, i.e., over 3 ESA and 5 USA shifts, in order to follow the spectral evolution through the precession cycle, establish the relative phasing of the photometric periods in different wavelengths and to refine the UV spin light curve.|Y
VARJE|Variable Accretion in Wide Binaries|Joel A.|Eaton|Tennessee State University - CEIS|Many of the zeta Aurigae binaries (K supergiant + B dwarf; P(orb) ~ years) show evidence of variable accretion onto the hot B-dwarf component. The accreted matter comes from the wind of the cool supergiant, and its flow onto the hot star is very likely moderated by magnetic fields as in T Tau stars. An alternative model for the observed accretion features has them forming in a large accretion shell around the hot star. I propose new observations to determine how the accretion changes on the rotational timescale of the B star. These will test magnetic accretion models, which predict that non-axisymmetrical magnetic fields will give periodic variation of the accretion features. This test is an important first step toward using zeta Aur binaries as a. laboratory for testing and developing models of magnetic (or non-magnetic) accretion and for testing further the possibility that all hot stars are magnetic.|Y

VENEB|SO 2 on Venus: A Final Cross-Calibration with Pioneer Venus|Edwin S.|Barker|U Texas - Austin|SO2 is an important indicator of key processes in the Venus atmosphere and perhaps the Venus surface. The most important question concerning the atmospheric SO2 is the magnitude and nature of its variability. Based on past Pioneer Venus(PV) and IUE observations, significant sulfur dioxide variations have been interpreted as indicating that the long-term atmospheric S02 abundance may be related to large, episodic injections from the surface or interior of Venus. If episodic events occur, then continuing observations of SO2 in the Venus atmosphere play a vital role in our understanding of Venus' current and past geologic evolution. The detailed mapping of the surface of Venus by Magellan currently taking place will add provide valuable information on the source of episodic injection should one occur. The probability of volcanism on Venus has strong implications for comparisons of the tectonics of Earth and Venus and would elucidate the nature of the Venus crust and interior.  The SO2 abundance above the cloud tops at Venus in 1978-1979 observed by Pioneer Venus was orders of magnitude higher than the concentrations measured before or since. Continuing observations are needed to establish and confirm the long term temporal behavior of SO2 on Venus.  Our objective is to obtain UV spectra of Venus at its Eastern and Western elongations in mid and late 1991 to measure the SO2 abundance and scale height. These additional abundance determinations will allow a valuable comparison with on-going Pioneer Venus measurements and with previous IUE observations (in 1979, 1987, and 1988). The IUE results are consistent with both the decline of SO2 from 1979 to 1987 reported by Esposito at al. (1988) and spatial variations of this magnitude seen by Pioneer Venus. Pioneer Venus will enter the Venus atmosphere in mid-1992. It is imperative that concurrent observations by IUE and Pioneer Venus be made in 1991 so we can maintain a long-term baseline of Venus' atmospheric SO2 abundance. The late 1991 elongation of Venus will be the last opportunity to cross-calibrate the sensitivities of the two aging spacecraft. The decline seen by Pioneer Venus is only believable with the independent verification provided by the 1987 and 1988 IUE measurments. If both spacescraft determine the same abundances for SO2, then we can use this agreement to increase our confidence in other scientific results for each spacecraft. High resolution IUE images of Venus will provide information on the SO2 concentration and scale height distribution which Pioneer Venus spectral resolution cannot provide. This will be our last opportunity to acquire new high resolution data to continue the on going monitoring of the Venus atmosphere for variations in the abundance of UV absorbers, particularly as they relate to evidence for volcanic or other internal activity as well as atmospheric chemistry.|Y
VENSA|IUE Spectrophotometry of Vega-Like Stars|Saul J.|Adelman|Citadel|We propose to obtain low dispersion trailed SWP and LWP exposures of some 20 stars. These data and optical region spectrophotometry will be used to derive spectral energy distributions. The fluxes of the stars, with anomalous line profiles like those seen in Vega at high dispersion and ultra-high signal-to-noise, will be compared with those of other stars with similar effective temperatures and surface gravities. Such comparisons will allow us to see whether these Vega-like stars have normal energy distributions and/or whether their energy distributions provide important information for modeling the distribution of temperatures over their surfaces.|Y
VEOEB|SO-2 Abundance on Venus: After Pioneer Venus|Edwin S.|Barker|U Texas - Austin|SO2 is an important indicator of key processes in the Venus atmosphere and perhaps the Venus surface. Based on past Pioneer Venus (PV) and IUE observations, significant sulfur dioxide variations have been interpreted as indicating that the long-term atmospheric SO2 abundance may be related to large, episodic injections from the surface or interior of Venus. If episodic events occur, then continuing observations of SO2 in the Venus atmosphere play a vital role in our understanding of Venus' current and past geologic evolution. Requested observations will provide coverage any injection event between 1991 and 1994.  The detailed mapping of the surface of Venus by Magellan currently taking place has added valuable information on regarding the sources of episodic injection. The probability of active volcanism on Venus has strong implications for comparisons of the tectonics of Earth and Venus and would elucidate the nature of the Venus crust and interior. The SO2 abundance above the cloud tops at Venus in 1978-1979 observed by Pioneer Venus was orders of magnitude higher than the concentrations measured before or since by PV or IUE. If the SO2 abundance increased dramatically during the lifetime of Magellan, we would have an unique opportunity to locate the source of the injection by looking for changes in the radar and radiometer images.  Our objective is to obtain UV spectra of Venus at its approaching Eastern and Western elongations in late 1992 and mid 1993 to measure the SO2 abundance and scale height. These additional abundance determinations will allow us to extend the coverage obtained from IUE observations (in 1979, 1987, 1988 and 1991) and determine the baseline SO2 abundance. The IUE results are consistent with both the decline Of SO2 from 1979 to 1987 reported by Esposito at al. (1988) and spatial variations of this magnitude seen by Pioneer Venus. Na (1990,1991) has continued the analysis of the IUE and other SO2 data as part of his dissertation.  Pioneer Venus will enter the Venus atmosphere in mid-1992 and will be no longer available to monitor the Venus SO2 abundance. Consequently, observations by IUE will be our only way to maintain a long-term baseline of Venus' atmospheric SO2 abundance.|Y
VERKS|High Velocity Gas in the Vela Supernova Remnant|Kenneth R.|Sembach|MIT|We propose to obtain high signal-to-noise SWP spectra of twelve early-type stars in the direction of the Vela Supernova Remnant. We will use the spectra to search for high velocity SNR features in species such as CII, CII*, C IV, O I, N II, Si II, Si III, Si IV, Al II, Al III, and S II. We will quantify the physical conditions and gas phase abundances of different elements in the gas as a function of expansion velocity for comparison with ionization and grain destruction models and observations of diffuse gas in the Milky Way and external systems. Complementary high-resolution, high S/N Na I and Ca II spectra have already been obtained and indicate that the velocity structure attributable to the Vela SNR along these sight lines is exceedingly rich. Multiple (3-4), co-added SWP spectra are required for each star so that detailed line analyses can be performed and weak components can be reliably detected.|Y

VHRDL|The UV Emission of V Hya, Normal Mira Star or Enveloped Companion?|Donald G.|Luttermoser|CSC - Astronomy Programs|Mass loss from asymptotic giant branch stars, particularly the coolest (N-type) carbon stars, offers an interesting probe for the analysis of the chemical history of our galaxy. One of the most interesting carbon stars is the SRa variable V Hya (N6). Not only does V Hya display evidence for Mira-type pulsations, but observations also suggest it has bipolar outflow. Recently V Hya was detected in a VLA continuum survey of N-type carbon stars at 3.6 cm, none of the other stars in the survey were seen. Only one lone low-resolution IUE spectrum of V Hya exists in the archive; Mg II emission was clearly present. I propose to investigate the physical process that gives rise to this emission in this peculiar N-type carbon star. By monitoring the Mg II emission at various phases throughout the pulsation cycle, I will be able to determine whether this emission is due to outward moving shocks driven by pulsation, shocks resulting from the bipolar outflow, or an accretion disk around an unseen companion as has been suggested to explain the bipolar outflow from this star.|Y

VKPMC|Short-Term Variability of Luminous K Stars: A Test Case of Hydrodynamic Modelling|Manfred|Cuntz|HAO - NCAR|We propose to obtain time series spectra of chromospheric diagnostics (Mg II, Mg I) on short timescales (< days) using the LWP camera at high dispersion, together with supporting ground-based data. We have selected three bright, but representative "coronal", "non-coronal", and "hybrid" stars: beta Gem (K0 III), alpha Tau (K5 III), and iota Aur (K3 II).  We aim to gain insight into the mechanism(s) responsible for chromospheric heating and mass loss, by studying the time-dependent behavior of the various chromospheric diagnostics on timescales which are important both from theoretical studies of chromospheric heating (including the interpretation of recent C II] 2325 A observations with GHRS) and from previous photospheric observational work. Our observations will be tested against existing ab-initio models.  We are convinced that only new observations capable to deduce the timescales of chromospheric line variabilities can provide insight into the dominant chromospheric heating and mass loss mechanism(s) in these stars. Although many IUE spectra exist for our target stars, no data address the short-term variability of the Ca II, Mg II, Mg I and H-alpha chromospheric and wind diagnostics simultaneously. Obtaining simultaneous observations of these lines is the only way to test key predictions from our theoretical models.|Y
VORJN|Stellar Wind Variability and Magnetic Fields in O Stars|Joy S.|Nichols|CSC - Astronomy Programs|The occurrence of the enigmatic discrete absorption components (DACs) in UV stellar wind lines in O stars is now believed to be rotationally modulated. Recent work also suggests that the origin of DACs is very close to the stellar surface. These two considerations make the presence of a (localized) magnetic field a prime candidate for explanation of the modulation.  We propose to obtain IUE spectra simultaneously with the planned ground-based magnetic-field measurements for a few of the brightest O stars, in order to investigate the suggested relation.|Y
VTOJN|The Spatially-Resolved Structure of the V711 Tau Stellar Environment|James E.|Neff|Penn State University|V711 Tau is the most thoroughly observed evolved, active binary system. The effect of magnetic activity on its photospheric spectrum has been studied extensively for the past decade, leading to images of the starspot regions. These structures have been observed to change radically on short timescales and to evolve slowly over several years. There is a strong suggestion of enhanced spottedness of the polar regions. The chromospheric spectrum is dominated by magnetic activity, but lack of proper data has prevented the construction of maps of similar spatial detail. We will spatially resolve the chromospheric structure of V711 Tau, a necessary first step in measuring the physical properties of its outer atmosphere. Combining this information with the photospheric imaging results, we will build up an understanding of the three-dimensional properties of magnetically active regions. By the same process, we will study the dynamics within magnetically active regions in the chromosphere and transition region and the dyunamics and energetics of flaring regions. We also will test whether chromospheric material is extended in large magnetic loops or is confined close to the photosphere. All of these detailed studies can be performed simultaneously for V711 Tau. The feasibility of our approach has been demonstrated for this and other stars. We now propose to bring all of our observing and analysis tools to aquire the optimal data set, which IUE alone can provide.|Y
VTROS|Flares and Intersystem Gas in V471 Tauri|Oswald H. W.|Siegmund|UC Berkeley - SSL|A recent flare observation of the star AU Mic has shown evidence of significant mass ejection. The interacting binary system V471 Tauri presents a good opportunity to verify this analysis, since we can measure the column density of the gas against the companion white dwarf. We have received EUVE time to monitor this system. Simultaneous IUE observations would allow us to observe mass ejection directly, and provide a useful constraint for the analysis of the EUVE data.|Y

The principal scientific goals are to understand better the evolutionary state occupied by these massive binaries, and to study the structures and motions of cool supergiant atmospheres.|Y
VVDAD|Continuation of Ultraviolet Studies of VV Cephei|Andrea K.|Dupree|CFA|We request observing time with IUE to continue our study of the remarkable eclipsing binary VV Cephei. IUE spectra of VV Cop taken as late as 2 years after its last eclipse still show low-excitation absorption Iines from the M-type atmosphere superimposed upon the continuum of the hot secondary. In order to establish better the character of the hot star and to study the structure of the extended atmosphere of the cool primary, it is necessary to obtain additional ultraviolet spectra during the next IUE observing cycle.|Y
VVEDL|Epsilon Aurigae in Eclipse|David L.|Lambert|Texas|Ultraviolet spectroscopy and spectrophotometry of the unique long-period binary Epsilon Aur is proposed during the first total eclipse since 1956. The ultraviolet eclipse curves will be used to define the characteristics of the secondary and the geometry of the system. High-dispersion spectra of the supergiant primary, which is eclipsed by the secondary, will provide absorption/emission lines produced by circumstellar gas and, perhaps, the large disk around the secondary. A complementary program of ground-based spectroscopy will be conducted.|Y
VVERC|Physics of the Circumstellar Envelope Accretion Disk & Secondary Companion IN EPS AUR|Robert D.|Chapman|NASSA/GSFC|The Epsilon Aurigae system consists of a late A or early F spectral type supergiant star with a secondary that is probably an early type star. The supergiant seems to be losing mass at a very high rate, leading to a complicated circumstellar envelope around the system. The portion of the envelope around the secondary passing in front of the supergiant leads to the observed eclipse in the system. Models of the system suggest that material flowing from the supergiant may form an accretion disk around the companion. We propose a series of observations of Epsilon Aurigae during the upcoming eclipse that, combined with our present data base, will enable us to greatly improve our knowledge of the system. Specifically, long- and short-wavelength, high-dispersion spectra obtained through primary eclipse are needed: to search for lines diagnostic of a putative accretion disk; to study lines characteristic of the wind of the primary star and other circumstellar mass flow to obtain quantitative information on the flows; and, to investigate the nature of the secondary companion.|Y
VVETS|Eclipse Observations of Epsilon Aurigae|Theodore|Simon|Hawaii|Epsilon Aur (FO Ia + ?) is a single-line spectroscopic binary which undergoes eclipse once every 27.1 years, the eclipse lasting nearly 2 years. The next eclipse will begin in late July 1982, perhaps as early as June. We are proposing to obtain highand low-dispersion ultraviolet (1150-3200A) spectra of this star at several points during ingress and at the onset of totality. These IUE observations will be made in conjunction with a very extensive program of optical and infrared measurements (broadband photometry, spectrophotometry, and spectroscopy) now underway at the Mauna Kea Observatory of the University of Hawaii, which will also be carried through ingress and the total phase of the eclipse. Our objective is to extend the eclipse light curves of Epsilon Aur to uv and IR wavelengths, and to follow the radial velocity displacements and profile shapes of shell lines as the partial phase progresses. These observations will provide new, critical information concerning the nature of the mysterious secondary component, the hypothetical eclipsing disk associated with the secondary, velocity fields in the extended atmosphere of the F supergiant, and mass flows (expanding shells or clouds, or stellar winds) in the Epsilon Aur system.|Y
VVFDL|Epsilon Aurigae in Eclipse|David L.|Lambert|Texas|A continuation of our IUE program of ultraviolet spectroscopy and spectrophotometry of the unique long-period binary Epsilon Aur is proposed during the current total eclipse, the first since 1956. The ultraviolet eclipse curves are being used to define the characteristics of the secondary and the geometry of the system. High-dispersion spectra of the supergiant primary, which is eclipsed by the secondary, provides absorption/emission lines produced by circumstellar gas and, perhaps, the large disk around the secondary. A complementary program of ground-based spectroscopy begun in November 1981 will be continued beyond the predicted date of fourth contact (1984 May).|Y
VVFIA|Secondary Minima of Zeta Aurigae Binaries|Imad|Ahmad|Imad-Ad-Dean|Evidence for extensive dynamic interaction in the Zeta Aur class of eclipsing binaries exists in a limited number of UV spectra obtained near times of secondary minima. This limited data suggests a shock interaction between the stellar winds of the early type dwarf and late type supergiant, plus an accretion column of matter falling onto the hotter star. Accretion columns are a recently discovered feature in some X-ray binary systems, and thus study of this kind of phenomena in "classical systems" like the Zeta Aur stars will provide important physical information about the formation and dynamics of such structures, with possible relevance to other classes of binaries. We propose to obtain a carefully planned sequence of UV spectra covering the predicted times of secondary minima for two Zeta Aur systems, which occur during 1983. These spectra will allow us to test: (a) the extent to which this phenomenon reveals a generic type of interaction; (b) the limits of the size of the interaction structures, and (c) flow vectors in the interaction regions. This data will provide the first check on the interaction model proposed by Chapman for these stars. In light of the multi-year orbital periods of these systems, the coming 1983 passage of secondary minima will possibly represent the final opportunity for this experiment using the IUE capability.|Y
VVFRC|Physics of the Circumstellar Envelope, Accretion Disk & Secondary Companion in Epsilon AUR|Robert D.|Chapman|NASA/GSFC|THE Epsilon Aurigae system consists of a late-A or early-F type supergiant with a secondary that may be an early type star. The supergiant is losing mass at a very high rate, leading to a complicated circumstellar envelope around the system. The portion of the envelope around the secondary, passing in front of the supergiant, leads to the observed eclipse. Models of the system suggest that material flowing from the supergiant may form an accretion disk around the companion. We propose a series of observations of Epsilon Aurigae during the ongoing eclipse that will enable us to greatly improve our knowledge of the system. Specifically, long- and short-wavelength, high-dispersion spectra obtained through primary eclipse are needed; to search for lines diagnostic of a putative accretion disk; to study lines characteristic of the wind of the primary star and other circumstellar mass flow; and, to investigate the nature of the secondary companion. The observations made in year five have revealed two interesting results so far: that the eclipse is nearly gray between the visible and the IUE long-wavelength region, but the depth of eclipse increases between the IUE long- and short-wavelength regions, suggesting dust as a possible source of opacity; and, the emission components of the Mg II resonance doublet remain constant in flux as the remainder of the spectrum decreases by almost a factor of two, suggesting that the plasma emitting the Mg II lines is, at least mostly, unobscured by eclipse.|Y
VVFTA|Further Eclipse Observations of Epsilon Aurigae|Thomas B.|Ake|CSC|Epsilon Aur (F0 Ia + ?) is a single-line spectroscopic binary which undergoes eclipse once every 27.1 years, the eclipse lasting nearly 2 years. The nature of the secondary is unknown, but the most viable model is that of a large disk or ring of material in which may be imbedded a hot central star. The 1982-84 eclipse has been followed by us with high and low dispersion IUE observations during the fifth episode, as well as with extensive optical and infrared measurements (broadband photometry, spectrophotometry and spectroscopy) at the Mauna Kea Observatory of the University of Hawaii. As of October 1982, we see no evidence for a hot secondary in the UV, nor high velocity material in the line spectrum. We find the UV light curve is dominated down to 1400 A by Cepheid-like variations of the primary, which have complicated the determination of when first UV contact occurred and the true depth of the UV eclipse. Strong emission has appeared in the Mg II line cores, but its strength is constant and its appearance results from a lowering of the local continuum level. The only other prominent emission feature, OI 1304, has decreased by 30-40% compared to pre-eclipse data. These results suggest that the primary is a long-period Cepheid, which gives rise to the periodic light variations and most likely the OI emission. The Mg II emission arises from the secondary or intersystem material. The extent and opacity of the material cannot be determined until the light variations are better defined. If the secondary is a large disk of grains or particles, the lack of significant change in the 2200 A dip sets lower limits on their size. During the sixth IUE episode, mid-totality and third contact are scheduled to occur. We are proposing further observations to address several issues. The timing and amplitude of the Cepheid variations needs to be defined to determine the shape of the UV eclipse light curve, which will yield information on the size and opacity of the occulting material. Observations during totality will be affected by the overall structure of the secondary. In particular, opaque ring models predict a brightening to occur near mid-totality, and the continuum flux or emission lines may return to early ingress values. Since no high velocity material was seen during ingress, its absence near third contact could rule out models where the source of the material arises from streaming from the primary. Finally, no UV data is available for A-F supergiants beyond 1500 A, and we propose to take deep SWP low dispersion exposures for one or two standards to resolve whether the observed continuum at ~130O A is due to the primary star or a faint, hot secondary component.|Y
VVGIA|A Study of Interaction Dynamics in Zeta Aurisae Binaries|Imad|Ahmad|Imad-Ad-Dean|We are now obtaining a carefully planned sequence of IUE spectra covering the predicted times of secondary minima for two zeta Aur systems. Preliminary analysis of this data confirms the presence of an accretion column in the highly interacting .systems. It also reveals clear evidence of secular variations in Mg II lines of zeta Aur. We propose a detailed examination of archived data of zeta Aur and 32 Cygni to investigate the source of such variations. We intend to to determine to what degree variations of the K-star wind velocity alter the accretion column absorption and whether the spectrum is complicated by inhomogeneous wind streams between the stars which, if present, may be observed at phases other than are the subject of our sixth year study.|Y
VVGJS|VV Cephei Type Stars|J. Scott|Shaw|Georgia|Three new VV Cephei-type stars were discovered by Barbier (1971). We propose to observe these systems to detect and characterize the continuum of the companion and to investigate emission lines from the cool M star and/or by circumstellar material. One star (BD+63 0003) has been monitored extensively by one of the investigators (EFG) and observations would be scheduled about 6 to 9 months apart to coincide with maximum and minimum light in order to detect any dependence of emission activity or interaction with the hot component on the pulsations of the M supergiant component.|Y
VVGRC|Physics of Epsilon Aurigae: Observations of Egress and Post-Eclipse|Robert D.|Chapman|NASA/GSFC|The Epsilon Aurigae system consists of a late-A or early-F type supergiant with a secondary that may be an early type star.

VVGTA|Egress Observations of Epsilon Aurigae|Thomas B.|Ake|CSC|Epsilon Aur (F0 Ia + ?) is a single-line spectroscopic binary which undergoes eclipse once every 27.1 years, the eclipse lasting nearly 2 years. The nature of the secondary is unknown, but the most viable model is that of a large disk or ring of material in which may be imbedded a hot central star. The 1982-84 eclipse has been followed by us with high and low resolution IUE observations as well as with extensive optical and infrared photometry, spectrophotometry and spectroscopy at the Mauna Kea Observatory of the University of Hawaii and McDonald Observatory of the University of Texas. As of September 1983, we have found that a broad, high-velocity absorption component has developed in Mg II and other low level absorption lines. This feature is of higher velocity than the shell features normally seen optically after mid-totality and may be evidence of a gas stream from the primary. The shape of the UV eclipse light curve is still indeterminant due to inadequate pre-eclipse observations. Particularly misleading was a brightening that occurred just before first contact, resulting in various interpretations of the detailed wavelength dependence of the eclipse depth. The UV light curve is dominated down to 1500 A by Cepheid-like pulsations of the primary, but below 1400 A the eclipse is much shallower than at other wavelengths and shows erratic behavior. Two possible models are that a hot star is being seen through openings in the disk around the secondary, or that the poles of the primary are warmer than the occulted part of its surface and the erratic behavior is seen due to variations of the primary behind the disk.  During the seventh IUE episode, fourth contact is scheduled to occur. We are proposing further observations to address several issues. The timing and amplitude of the Cepheid variations, which are best observed outside of eclipse, needs to be defined to determine the shape of the UV eclipse light curve, which will yield information on the size and opacity of the occulting material. The UV brightening that occurred just prior to first contact will be searched for at fourth contact, as will a possible extension of UV eclipse beyond the geometrical end of eclipse. High quality SWP exposures are needed to compare with totality spectra to determine if the observed line blends below 1400 arise from a hot secondary or warmer gas of the primary's poles. Finally we wish to chart the presence of gas streams that are now apparent as high velocity absorption components in low level lines.|Y
VVHRC|Physics of the Epsilon Aurigae System|Robert D.|Chapman|NASA/GSFC|The most recent eclipse of Epsilon Aurigae began with first contact in July 1982 and ended with fourth contact in May 1984. Before, during and after the eclipse a large number of observations have been made with the IUE. This proposal requests: 1) one US1 shift to make one additional post-eclipse observation to extend the observational baseline; and, 2) support for a one-year, in-depth analysis and interpretation effort to study the entire data set obtained by several teams of American and European observers now that the eclipse is completed.|Y
VVHSP|Eclipse Coverage of the G Supergiant 22 Vul|Sidney B.|Parsons|CSC|Follow up observations are proposed of the binary system 22 Vul discovered with IUE to be an eclipsing system. The secondary star is detected directly only in the ultraviolet and appears to be a normal B9 main sequence star. The primary is a G3 Ib-II star with a 249 day spectroscopic orbit, and now provides the warmest example of a zeta Aurigae type eclipsing binary. Enhanced Fe II absorption against the B9 spectrum in the mid and far UV has been noted well away from geometrical eclipse of the hot component and implies probably an extensive envelope around the G supergiant. There is a close correspondence between the far UV spectrum of 22 Vul just outside of eclipse and spectra of interacting binaries well outside of eclipse, suggesting common properties of a relatively dense, warm plasma. More UV observations are needed at various times near eclipse to map out the extent and homogeneity of the plasma, to study its physical properties, to look for similarities with the better-studied zeta Aurigae systems, and to relate it to the more complex situations of strongly interacting binary systems. Reasonably comprehensive observations of 22 Vul with the IUE will provide hitherto unavailable information on the outer atmosphere of a G supergiant.|Y
VVIBA|Post-Eclipse Observations of the Episilon Aurigae System|Bruce M.|Altner|A. R. CORP.|We propose to observe a series of SWP and LWP spectra of the eclipsing binary system Epsilon Aurigae in Its current, post-eclipse state. Earlier IUE observations, obtained primarily during the recent 1982-1984 eclipse cycle, have shown that a significant, time dependent UV excess exists in this system, but ambiguities remain in all of the models that attempt to account for it. We suggest that a detailed study of the time variations of the flux from the hot component may help to remove some of these ambiguities and thus provide some important constraints on models of this system applicable at all wavelengths.|Y
VVKIA|Atmospheric Eclipses of HR 6902 and 22 Vul|Imad|Ahmad|Imad-Ad-Dean|The IUE has permitted the direct observation of a number of absorption lines due to C I, O I, etc. in zeta Aurigae type binary systems. These lines offer an excellent opportunity to make a precise determination of the rotational velocity of the supergiant primaries. They may also be used to make a curve of growth analysis to estimate the element abundances. These ions and the presence or absence of CO are indicators of the degree to which the presence of a hot companion affects the supergiant chromosphere. Whether or not HR 6902 undergoes total eclipse, it undergoes an atmospheric eclipse which, given its short period, makes it an excellent system for the study of the foregoing problem.|Y
VVNRS|Ultraviolet Monitoring of VV Cephei|Robert E.|Stencel|Colorado - CASA|VV Cephei, like alpha Ori, is a well studied M supergiant. However, VV Cep also is a binary system in which a 20 solar mass main sequence star orbits within the extended atmosphere of the M supergiant primary. Although the period of the system is 20.3 years, the components are relatively close enough for a stream of matter from the primary to form an accretion disk around the hot secondary. We have recently completed a study of 12 years of archival IUE spectra of this system and were surprised to find frequent, intermittent changes in the line profiles of the chromosphere-like absorption spectrum. We believe these changes may be related to the non-steady mass loss from the red supergiant, feeding the accretion process. Existing spectra are not closely enough spaced in time to delineate the nature of these changes. Therefore, we request 8 half-shifts in order to observe VV Cephei every two weeks during a 2-1/2 month period in summer '91 as well as a 6 week period in winter '92 during which the system is optimally accessible to IUE.|Y
VVQWB|Long- and Short-Term Variations in the Interacting Binary VV Cephei|Wendy|Bauer|Wellesley College|VV Cephei is an interacting binary consisting of an M2 supergiant with a hot companion, probably an early B star surrounded by an accretion disk resulting from mass transfer between the two components. The system has an orbital period of 20.3 years. Observations of VV Cephei with IUE began in April 1978 when the system was emerging from primary eclipse, and have continued over about 3/4 of the orbit. In addition to long-term variations with phase, significant variations on time scales as short as two weeks have been observed, suggesting episodic mass transfer. I propose to extend the IUE monitoring of this system to phases which have not yet been observed in the ultraviolet.|Y

VWNEG|Deciphering Long-Term Photospheric and Chromospheric Activity on VW Cep|Edward F.|Guinan|Villanova University|VW Cep is one of the brightest and best observed short period W UMa binaries. It consists of G5V and K0V components in contact with their Roche limiting surfaces. Because of its long history of ground based and satellite observations VW Cep can serve as the prototype for understanding this important class of active close binaries.  The scientific aims of this program are a) a continuation of the long term monitoring of this important system in the UV and optical especially since the 1990 light curves indicate a dramatic increase in luminosity of the binary (which seems to occur only once every 7-8 years), b) to obtain for the first time thorough (0.10 phase resolution) coverage of the system with IUE, coordinated with ground based photometry and possible ROSAT pointed x-ray observations in order to map out active regions, c) using high dispersion LWP spectra of the Mg II h + k lines we wish to determine the individual contributions to the Mg II flux from each component and to further investigate the unexplained strong third source of Mg II emission that we discovered in 1989. VW Cep represents an extreme case for studying stellar dynamo theory and the proposed IUE observations can play a crucial role in the understanding of magnetic fields and activity cycles in rapidly rotating solar-like stars. The longevity of the IUE satellite has permitted the accumulation of an important and unique database on VW Cep. The proposed observations will extend and expand this database and hopefully lead to an understanding of the complexities of this active W UMa binary.|Y
VWRDM|Wind Variability in the Radial Pulsator BW Vul|Derck L.|Massa|Applied Research Corporation|The mechanism and physical origin of wind instability in early-type stars still elude understanding. For example, attempts to determine a connection between the nonradial pulsations which occur in most "normal" OB stars, and wind variability have proved difficult. The reason may be, in part, that the velocity fields associated with the nonradial pulsations add incoherently across the stellar disk, making it difficult to ascertain a connection between a spectroscopic signature of pulsation amplitude and wind variability. We propose to investigate the simpler case of radial pulsation, where the spatial coherence of the motion across the stellar disk allows us to examine the detailed motions and processes which are probably occurring locally on the surfaces of other OB stars, but are more difficult to detect due to the complexity of their velocity fields. BW Vul is the largest amplitude beta Cep star, with radial velocity amplitude (2K) of 160 km/s, V band amplitude of 0.15 mag, 5 hr period, and a large amplitude radial pulsation mode uncomplicated by nonradial modes. We propose to obtain optimal exposures sampling its 5 hr period every 10 min. This proposal represents a small investment of IUE time but promises to provide an essential element to understanding whether wind variability originates in the photosphere or lower wind.|Y

WCPBM|A New WC 11 Star|Bruce M.|McCollum|CSC - IUE Observatory|Only a handful of WC 11 stars are known, and only 3 of these have been observed by IUE. Recently it was found that IRAS 17514-1555 is a WC 11 star. IUE observations of other WC 11 stars have brought out interesting features regarding element abundances and the nature of the circumstellar dust. It is proposed to obtain similar observations of 17514-1555 in order to compare with IUE data on the other three observed WC 11 stars, to assist in modeling and understanding these rare but important objects, which may form a link between planetary nebulae and R CrB stars.|Y
WCRJD|UV Spectroscopy of New [WC11] Stars|John S.|Drilling|Louisiana State University|Approximately 10 to 20 percent of the central stars of planetary nebulae exhibit strong emission lines of carbon, helium, etc., similar to the Wolf-Rayet WC stars. The class of Wolf-Rayet WC central stars of planetary nebulae extends to lower stellar temperatures than their massive counterparts. At present there are 13 objects classified as [WC11] (where the brackets indicate the association with PN). The central stars of [WC11] PN have effective temperatures between 20,000K and 30,000K, and there are large differences in the circumstellar extinction, stellar wind velocities, mass loss rates, and sizes of the nebulae associated with these stars. They are in the earliest observable phase of planetary nebula evolution after the onset of ionization of the circumstellar envelope. Detailed studies of these objects can significantly advance our understanding of the preceding post-AGB evolution. Observing time is therefore requested to obtain low-resolution spectra for 4 new [WC11] stars with both IUE cameras.|Y
WDDGW|Observations of the Ultraviolet Spectra of Carbon White Dwarfs|Gary A.|Wegner|Penn State|The stars to be investigated belong to a sample of relatively cool white dwarfs (Teff between 7000 to 10000 K) with peculiar spectra. Most of these objects are either known or are suspected to show bands of the C2 molecule in the visual portion of their spectra or have continuous spectra in the visible. Ultraviolet spectrograms of a few of these stars have already provided exciting new information on the element abundances in their atmospheres by showing strong lines of CI. More generally, these observations could yield new data on the relative importance of convective mixing, gravitational settling and accretion in the outer layers of the C2 white dwarfs, a topic currently of considerable theoretical interest.|Y
WDDWB|IUE Radial Velocity Studies: White Dwarf Systems|W.|Beavers|Iowa State University|In recent years eclipsing systems consisting of a white dwarf-late dwarf pair have been found. The first such object, V471 Tauri (BD+16516) was detected originally as a spectroscopic binary by Wilson (1953). Nelson and Young (1970) observed the eclipses of the system which probably consists of a KO dwarf and a white dwarf. Proper motion and center of mass radial velocity are consistent with Hydades membership (Young and Capps, 1971). As the first detected eclipsing binary with a hot white dwarf companion the system is extremely interesting as a source of fundamental data for the very hot white dwarfs and as an example of what must be a very intriguing evolutionary history. The short orbital period of 12 1/2 hours with white dwarf eclipses of 48 minutes totality and partial phases of about one minute offer the possibility of being followed through a complete orbit during a pair of I.U.E. observing shifts. Recently HD 86590 has been reported to be another such system. Considerably brighter than V471 Tauri, this second possible candidate will be receiving the ground based photometric and spectroscopic scrutiny which could make it the second bright white dwarf-late dwarf system within reach of the high dispersion I.U.E. spectrometer for radial velocity study.  Fick Observatory has an extensive program of stellar radial velocity observation and study. During the past four years over 11,000 radial velocity measurements have been made with the photoelectric RV spectrometer. This experience in RV observation and analysis will be applied to the task of obtaining high quality radial velocity measurements with the I.U.E. system. In addition, it is intended to make ground based radial velocity observing searches for possible additional candidate systems for future I.U.E. observations.|Y
WDECB|Studies of Hot White Dwarfs & The Local ISM|C. Stuart|Bowyer|Cal Berkeley|We propose to significantly expand the existing level of knowledge concerning hot white dwarfs by taking IUE spectra of twelve known hot DA's. At present, there are so few accurate determinations of effective temperatures of the hotter WD's that the effect of cooling cannot be gauged. Moreover, only two of the more than 500 known DA WD's have measured helium abundances. This results in much uncertainty regarding the nature of mass loss in stars prior to reaching the white dwarf stage. Abundance measurements would also provide a needed input into theoretical work on diffusion, accretion, and radiative acceleration in WD atmospheres. The program we are suggesting entails first taking low dispersion (SWP and LWR) spectra of all twelve candidates. The resulting accurate continuum flux measurements, when compared with model atmosphere fluxes, will provide very accurate temperature determinations, as well as an estimate of the helium abundance. We intend next to take high dispersion spectra of six of the brightest stars. These spectra will measure the equivalent width of the Hall 1640 A line, making it possible to determine helium abundances as low as n[H]/n[He] = 10^-4 which is two orders of magnitude more sensitive than optical observations. An added benefit of these high resolution spectra is that the nearly featureless continua of the WD's makes detection possible of interstellar absorption lines at Wlambda > 25 mA. These observations will therefore add greatly to our knowledge of the composition, density, and ionization state of the local ISM.|Y
WDEFB|The Sharp-Lined Features in the UV Spectra of Hot White Dwarfs|Frederick C.|Bruhweiler|CSC|In our studies of nearby white dwarfs using IUE high-dispersion (Bruhweiler and Kondo 1981a, 1981b, 1982) data, we find sharplined resonance features of heavy elements with velocity displacements all longward of the interstellar features in at least 3 of the 4 white dwarfs studied. The data indicates that these lines are associated with the white dwarfs in each case. if so, these observations represent the first detection of heavy elements in DA and also in hot helium-rich white dwarfs. On the basis of the current available observations no single mechanism can be favored. We wish to observe a wider sample of white dwarfs at high dispersion in order to map the extent of this phenomenon over a range of effective temperature and white dwarf spectral type. The results from this study, would be extremely important for understanding the evolution and physical processes occurring in white dwarfs.|Y
WDEGW|A Study of the Ultraviolet Spectra of White Dwarfs Containing Carbon|Gary A.|Wegner|Renn State|The stars to be investigated belong to a sample of relatively cool white dwarfs (Teff between 7000 to 10000 K) with peculiar spectra. Most of these objects are either known or are suspected to show bands of the C2 molecule in the visual portion of their spectra or have continuous spectra in the visible. Ultraviolet spectrograms of some of these stars have already provided exciting new information on the element abundances in their atmospheres by showing strong lines of CI. More generally, these observations could yield new data on the relative importance of convective mixing, gravitational settling and accretion in the outer layers of the C2 white dwarfs, a topic currently of considerable theoretical interest.|Y
WDFCB|Continuing Studies of Hot White Dwarfs and the Local ISM|C. Stuart|Bowyer|UC Berkeley|We propose to continue our program which has already significantly increased the existing level of knowledge concerning hot white dwarfs by taking IUE spectra of hot DA's. At present, there are so few accurate determinations of effective temperatures of the hotter WD's that an effective study of cooling mechanisms has been very difficult. Moreover, less than five of the more than 500 known DA WD's have measured helium abundances. Abundance and temperature measurements will provide much needed input into theoretical work on neutrino cooling, diffusion, accretion, and radiative acceleration of metals in WD atmospheres. At the same time, these objects provide an excellent probe of the local interstellar medium, aiding measurement of its structure, density, and level of ionization by serving as hot featureless continuum sources. The program we are suggesting entails first taking low dispersion (SWP and LWR) spectra of all candidates. The resulting accurate continuum flux measurements, when compared with model atmosphere fluxes, will provide very accurate temperature determinations. We also intend to take high dispersion spectra of the brightest stars. These helium abundances as low as = 10^-4 (two orders of magnitude more sensitive than optical observations). Since these spectra have a nearly featureless continuum, detection of interstellar absorption lines at Wlambda > 25 mA is possible both for neutral and highly ionized species. Additionally, the availability of the very accurate model atmosphere continuum fluxes allows accurate measurements to be made of the wavelength dependence of continuum absorption by interstellar dust. These observations will therefore add greatly to our knowledge of the composition, density, and ionization state of the local ISM.|Y
WDFFB|Mass Loss and Radiative Levitation in Hot White Dwarfs|Frederick C.|Bruhweiler|Catholic University|We have recently completed a study of 8 hot white dwarfs, 7 DA and 1 He-rich, using IUE high-dispersion data. Of the 7 DA white dwarfs, three show unexpected sharp-lined features of heavy elements, such as Si II-IV, C IV, and N V, arising in the immediate environment of the star. We suggest that radiative acceleration may be levitating these ions in white dwarf photospheres, and further suggest that sharp-lined features of heavy elements are observable in hot DA white dwarfs when Teff > 20,000 k and log(g) < 8.0. In addition, results for 2 DA white dwarfs, surprisingly, indicate mass loss. Although still tentative, both our observational results and theoretical interpretations have already stimulated significant interest among our astronomical colleagues. We propose a continuation of our program to obtain high-dispersion observations of additional DA white dwarfs in order to search for additional evidence for mass loss in white dwarf, and to further map out the Teff-log(g) domain in which these newly discovered phenomena occur, and to test our now tentative conclusions on a larger sample of data. This program may provide further insights into mass loss mechanisms not only in white dwarfs, but in all stars where this process is observed.|Y
WDFGW|A Search for Metal Lines in the Ultraviolet Spectra of White Dwarfs|Gary A.|Wegner|Dartmouth University|The stars to be investigated belong to a sample of relatively cool DA white dwarfs (Teff between 7000 and 17000 K). This class of star has not been heavily studied by IUE observers, but recently with the discovery of a still unidentified depression near 1400 in the spectra of some of these objects, they now seem much more interesting than thought earlier. It is proposed that an enlarged sample of the DA's be studied in order to (1) look for and check the reality of this spectral feature, (2) search for other ultraviolet lines, and (3) compare the observed spectral energy distributions, determined from combining ultraviolet and visual data, with those from model atmospheres. More generally, these observations could yield new information on the roles of convective mixing, gravitational settling, accretion and layering of the elements in the outer layers of white dwarfs, topics currently of considerable interest.|Y
WDFHS|Carbon and Silicon in the Helium White Dwarf GD 40|Harry L.|Shipman|Delaware|Previous IUE work on the helium rich white dwarf star GD 40 (Shipman and Greenstein, Ap.J. in press) demonstrates that the Fe/Ca and Mg/Ca abundance ratios derived from optical and long wavelength IUE spectra of this star are dramatically different from the predictions of diffusion theories, the currently favored explanation for abundance anomalies in white dwarf stars and other types of stars. This particular star offers a unique opportunity to determine the abundances Of several species of heavy elements in a helium-rich white dwarf star which is hot enough so that its atmospheric structure is reasonably wellunderstood. Short-wavelength IUE spectra, not obtained so far by IUE users, can probe the abundances of carbon and silicon and provide further, critically important tests of diffusion theories.|Y
WDFJH|High Resolution Observations of Hot White Dwarfs|Jay B.|Holberg|USC-Arizona|It is proposed to obtain high resolution IUE spectra of two white dwarfs including the bright nearby white dwarf CD-39 10980 with the objective of searching for both stellar-related and interstellar absorption lines. Recent IUE observations of other nearby white dwarfs lead to the expectation that CD38 10990 may also show the presence of sharp absorption lines having Doppler shifts characteristic of the star itself. Because CD-38 10980 is one of only a few white dwarfs with a measured gravitational red shift, the Doppler shift of any narrow absorption lines originating in or near the stellar atmosphere could provide important information as to location of the region of formation. A secondary by-product of such an observation will be a determination of local interstellar medium column abundances of such species as C II, N I and Si II along a previously uninvestigated line of sight. From such abundances it should be possible to estimate an H I column density to CD-38 10980, which could help resolve the differences between recent Voyager and IUE determinations of the H I column in the direction of HD149499B.|Y
WDFJL|Two Cool White Dwarfs with Metallic Lines|James W.|Liebert|Arizona|We propose to obtain LWR spectra of two cool white dwarfs with optical calcium absorption features. The purpose is to analyze the results in terms of model atmosphere synthetic spectra to derive the elemental abundances. Our present understanding is that helium is the primary atmospheric constituent in such objects and that the heavier elements are supplied by accretion of interstellar material. The Ca/Mg ratio is then a measure of the depletion of Ca onto grains. The major puzzle in this picture is the near absence of any surface hydrogen and the wide variation of Ca/Mg and Ca/H in the four well studied cases. Observations of Mg II h and k along with Fe and other metallic features in the near ultraviolet are critical to the spectral synthesis, and these two objects will substantially increase the presently limited sample.|Y
WDFJN|Blue Soft X-Ray Candidates|John A.|Nousek|Penn State University|The HEAO-l Low Energy Detectors performed the first all sky survey for soft X-ray (0.1-2 keV) sources (Nugent at al 1982). Objective prism plates taken of the X-ray error boxes have produced four extremely blue candidates. Higher resolution spectroscopy has confirmed the blue continuum but found it to be featureless (except for weak H-beta absorption in one).  I propose to search for UV emission from these objects, presumably hot, nearby white dwarfs with moderate length IUE exposures (~ I^h). Detection of these objects would confirm the x-ray identification and make them among the hottest white dwarfs known.|Y
WDFJS|IUE Observations of the RS Cvn|J. Scott|Shaw|Georgia|DH Leo (HD86590) is a bright RS CVn-white dwarf binary. We propose to observe the spectrum of the white dwarf as well as attempting to detect its possible eclipse by the K0V component. At visible wavelengths the eclipse of the white dwarf component, if it does occur, would be impossible to detect, because of the overwhelming relative brightness of the cool component. This will lead to a better determination of the system's orbital elements and the physical characteristics of the white dwarf. In addition, the variation of the K0V component's chromospheric emission will be monitored with phase. These observations will be coordinated with ground based photoelectric observations of the photometric wave.|Y
WDGFB|Levitation and Mass Loss in Hot DA White Dwarfs|Frederick C.|Bruhweiler|Catholic University|We have recently published a study of 8 hot white dwarfs, 7 DA and 1 He-rich, using IUE high-dispersion data. Of the 7 DA white dwarfs, three show unexpected sharplined features of heavy elements, such as Si II-IV, C IV, and N V, arising in the immediate environment of the stars. We suggest that radiative acceleration may be levitating these ions in white dwarf photospheres, and further suggest that sharplined features of heavy elements are observable in hot DA white dwarfs when Teff 20,000 k and log(g) < 8.0. In addition, results for 2 DA white Dwarfs, surprisingly, indicate mass loss. Although still tentative, both our observational results and theoretical interpretations have already stimulated significant interest among our astronomical colleagues. We propose a continuation of our program to obtain highdispersion observations of 5DA white dwarfs (3 having determined parallaxes) in order to search for additional evidence for mass loss in white dwarfs, and to further map out the Teff-109(g) domain in which these newly discovered phenomena occur, and to test our now tentative conclusions on a larger sample of data. This program may provide further insights into mass loss mechanisms not only in white dwarfs, but in all stars where this process is observed.|Y
WDGFW|Ultraviolet Observations of the Pulsating Da White Dwarf (ZZ Ceti) Stars|Francois|Wesemael|Montreal|We propose to measure the short-wavelength ultraviolet energy distributions of a sample of pulsating DA white dwarfs. These data will be analyzed with the help of model atmosphere techniques in order to derive accurate, timeaveraged effective temperatures for these stars. The primary scientific objectives are to better define the exact location and width of the ZZ Ceti instability strip and, in particular, to verify the expected existence of a period-color correlation among the ZZ Ceti variables. This will provide a very important test of the linear, nonadiabatic theory of nonradial stellar pulsations.|Y
WDGGW|Ultraviolet Absorptions in the Spectra of DA White Dwarfs|Gary A.|Wegner|Dartmouth University|The stars to be investigated belong to a sample of relatively cool DA white dwarfs with Teff below about 12000 K. Earlier IUE studies have shown that most if not all of these objects have an unidentified absorption near 1395 and more recent IUE observations have revealed the exciting result that these spectral features turn to tremendously strong depressions at temperatures below or about 10,000 K and that additional ones appear. At present, there is no generally accepted explanation for these absorptions, a short review of the possibilities being given in the text. It is proposed that a limited number of the coolest DA's be studied in order to: (1) Search for additional ultraviolet features that do not appear at the higher temperatures hitherto examined, (2) Obtain further information on the temperature dependence of the known features, and (3) compare the observed spectral energy distributions, determined from combining ultraviolet and visual data, with those from model atmospheres. More generally, these observations could yield new information on the nature of the DA white dwarfs. Until quite recently, it was commonly believed that|Y
WDGHS|Spectroscopy of Magnetic White Dwarf Stars Including the Unique Emission-Line Object GD356|Harry L.|Shipman|Delaware|Greenstein (private communication and IAU Circular 3823, see appendix has discovered a unique, emission-line magnetic white dwarf star, GD 356, which has faint emission lines with Zeeman components displaced by about 50 A from line center. This is the highest priority target in this proposal. The interpretation of this object is still uncertain, but for virtually any reasonable model for the source of the emission lines, there should be strong and broad emission at Lyman-alpha. I also propose to obtain additional IUE observations, and analyze existing data, of several magnetic white-dwarf stars with absorption lines. Only 3 of the weak-field stars, where the spectra can be interpreted, have been observed so far with IUE. I propose to observe two more, as well as doing a reasonably detailed model-atmosphere fit to the 3 where data is already available.|Y
WDGJH|White Dwarf Lyman Alpha Profiles|Jay B.|Holberg|Arizona| We propose to obtain IUE L-alpha profile measurements for eight hot DA white dwarfs. The technique employed is to obtain a double exposed, large and small aperture, SWP image in order to optimize the L-alpha profile of each star. A significant additional factor is the availability of 912 to 1150 A fluxes from the Voyager ultraviolet spectrometers for each of these stars.  The additional Voyager data serve two important functions. First, they independently measure the continuum level between L-alpha and L-beta. Second they provide a check on the shortest wavelength IUE fluxes, thereby increasing confidence in IUE measurements of the  blue wing of L-alpha. Improved measurements of the L-alpha profile promise to provide a sensitive measure of the temperature for DA white dwarfs as well as providing an important constraint on the surface gravity. Such determinations can be directly compared with the temperatures estimated from energy distributions observed with Voyager and IUE and with ground based estimates of the surface gravity. Extensive grids of pure hydrogen model atmospheres are now available so that a thorough investigation of the compatibility of models and observations will be possible.|Y
WDGJL|A Search for Hot DB White Dwarfs|James W.|Liebert|Arizona|The purpose of this proposal Is to determine whether any of the hot DB white dwarfs In the Palomar-Green sample have effective temperatures in the 30,000 - 40,000 K range. Currently, there are no stars established in this temperature Interval, though some 50 DB white dwarfs are catalogued, and some 14 hotter DO white dwarfs with Teff > 45,000 K are known. It is noteworthy that the pulsating DB star GD358 has the bluest colors of the DB stars observed with IUE and Teff ~30,000 K; among our proposed targets not yet observed with IUE is a second recently discovered pulsating DB star PG1654+160.|Y
WDGJN|Newly Discovered X-Ray White Dwarfs: H1501+66 and H1659+44|John A.|Nousek|Penn State University|Two HEAO-l Soft X-ray sources, H1501+66 and H1659+44, have been identified with extremely blue featureless optical continuum objects. Exploratory IUE exposures have detected UV flux from these optically faint (~ 15^m) objects. This proposal seeks to obtain longer exposures to improve the continuum measurement, measure any 2200 A extinction and detect weak lines. The scientific import is to confirm white dwarf nature of the objects and better estimate their physical parameters.|Y
WDGJR|The Mass of Feige 24|John C.|Raymond|Harvard CFA - SAO|Feige 24 is among the hottest nearby white dwarfs, 60,000 - 70,000 K. It is unique among nearby hot white dwarfs in having a close binary companion. Mass estimates based on the mass-radius relation, 0.11 to 0.3 M(sun)), disagree with the mass estimated from the velocity curve of the M dwarf companion, 0.46 to 1.24 M(sun). Sharp absorption lines of C IV, N V and Si IV are found to have low velocity interstellar and high velocity stellar components, Measurement of the white dwarf velocity at an appropriate phase will determine its mass and provide a test of theories of white dwarf structure. The proposed observation will also test the suggestion of Bruhweiler and Kondo that the narrow UV absorption features observed in white atmospheres are blue-shifted due to a stellar wind or formed in static halos about the stars. It will also provide a measurement of the emission from the companion star due to heating by the white dwarf's EUV radiation.|Y
WDHBM|A New, Extremely Hot White Dwarf|Bruce|Margon|Washington|We have recently identified an exceedingly ultraviolet bright star which appears to be a previously uncatalogued DA white dwarf. Comparison of its broadband colors with that of HZ 43, one of the hottest currently-known white dwarfs, indicates that our new object is of comparable temperature. We propose low resolution IUE spectroscopy to accurately fix this temperature, via comparison with existing model atmospheres. These very rare, hottest DAs play an important role in our understanding of the white dwarf luminosity function.|Y
WDHES|IUE Echelle Studies of Diffusion, Abundances and Evolution of the Hottest Do White Dwarfs|Edward M.|Sion|Villanova|We propose to observe two, very hot, peculiar, helium-rich, CNO-enhanced, DO white dwarfs in the high resolution mode. Our objectives are (1) to determine accurate Teff and log g, independent of energy distribution fits, by fitting photospheric absorption features with newly calculated, helium-rich, high gravity, synthetic spectra; (2) to derive metal abundances from detected absorption features, providing a critical test of diffusion theory/radiative acceleration calculations as well as composition clues to prior evolutionary states; (3) to compare the derived abundances and properties of the unusual DO, KPDO005+5601 with hotter and cooler DO degenerates in order to determine its evolutionary status and identify its progenitor and; (4) to search for evidence of on going mass loss and circumstellar gas in KPDO005+5601 and PG1034+001, both of which have optical reversed emission cores at HeII (4686) and in KPDO005+5601, H-beta, H-gamma and CIV emission.|Y
WDHFB|Mass Loss and Levitation in Hot White Dwarfs|Frederick C.|Bruhweiler|Catholic University|We propose to extend our high dispersion IUE studies of the sharp-lined features in hydrogen atmosphere DA white dwarfs in order to pursue two objectives.  1.) We will test our pure radiative levitation model which predicts that no heavy elements should be seen in DA white dwarfs with T<20,000 K. We will observe two (2) cool (Teff ~ 15,000 K) white dwarfs to search for sharp-lined features. If they are similar to those in hot DAs, they will only be seen at high dispersion. We emphasize that no high dispersion spectrum of any white dwarf significantly below 20,000 K has ever been obtained.  Such observations will also determine if the broad 1400 A feature, seen at low dispersion, is due to high pressure broadening phenomena of hydrogen or to heavy elements.  2.) We will more fully explore the domain of observed mass loss in hot DA white dwarfs. We will observe two (2) objects in an attempt to increase the number of potential objects which exhibit mass loss. Radial velocities of UV features will be combined with those obtained by us from the sharp non-LTE cores of H-alpha in these objects. The radial velocity differences will enable us to determine if the UV features originate in stationary or expanding halos in these objects.  In addition, we are cooperating with others who will obtain reliable effective temperatures and gravities from low dispersion IUE studies of these same objects. By incorporating their results, we expect to map out accurately the temperature-gravity domain of mass loss in hot DA white dwarfs.|Y
WDHGS|A Study of Strongly Magnetic Variable White Dwarfs|Gary D.|Schmidt|Arizona|Breakthroughs in our understanding of the fields on highly magnetic white dwarfs (MWDs) have recently come in the form of accurate calculations of the behavior of the hydrogen atom in fields 100 - 1000 MG (MG = 10^6 G) and the first successful interpretations of the UV and optical spectra of Grw +7008247. We propose to make IUE observations of four additional degenerates, three which are known to have fields in excess of 100 MG, and one candidate magnetic star, which will complete the UV observations of MWDs with very strong fields. These data will be combined with optical spectroscopy and polarimetry and used to address: (1) the exact field strengths for individual objects, (2) the distribution of fields among MWDs in general and high-field objects in particular, (3) the chemical composition of these stars as well as of MWDs in general, (4) surface temperatures, and (5) the field structure and evolution in stars of extreme magnetism.|Y
WDHGW|A Study of the Ultraviolet Absorptions in the Spectra of DA White Dwarfs|Gary A.|Wegner|Dartmouth University|The stars to be investigated belong to a sample of relatively cool DA white dwarfs with Teff below about 17000 K. Earlier IUE studies have shown that most if not all of these objects have absorptions near 1395 and 1600, and more recent IUE observations have revealed that these spectral features turn to tremendously strong depressions at temperatures below about 10,000 K. At present, the most viable of the several proposed explanations appears to be that 1600 is a resonance broadening of Ly-alpha, while 1400 arises from a Ly-alpha satellite line. It is proposed that a number of the coolest DA's be studied in order to: (1) Search for possible new ultraviolet features that do not appear at the higher temperatures, (2) Obtain further information on the temperature dependence of the known features, and (3) compare the observed spectral energy distributions from combined ultraviolet and visual data with those from model atmospheres. From our model atmospheres and analyses of 1400 and 1600 in the spectra of a handful of cool DAs, we find that these features could be used as an excellent indicator of surface gravity. Consequently, these observations could yield new information on the nature of the cool DA white dwarfs. Until quite recently, only lines of hydrogen have been available for analysis and these features promise to yield new insight into the structure and properties of their atmospheres.|Y
WDIFW|Observations of ZZ Ceti Stars|Francois|Wesemael|Montreal|We propose to measure the short-wavelength ultraviolet energy distributions of a sample of pulsating DA white dwarfs. These data will be analyzed with the help of model atmosphere techniques in order to derive accurate, timeaveraged effective temperatures for these stars. The primary scientific objectives are 1) to confirm the existence of a period-effective temperature correlation among the ZZ Ceti variables - an important test of the linear, nonadiabatic theory of nonradial stellar pulsations -, and 2) to study further a newly - discovered absorption feature at 1520A, which has been seen in the IUE spectra of ZZ Ceti stars only.|Y
WDIGW|Ultraviolet Spectra of Two Magnetic White Dwarfs|Gary A.|Wegner|Dartmouth|The stars being proposed for investigation are both hydrogen dominated magnetic DA white dwarfs with surface magnetic fields in the range of 30 to 40 MG with effective temperatures in the range of 10,000 K to 20,000 K. Earlier IUE studies of white dwarfs in this range of effective temperature have shown that there are strong absorptions near 1400 and 1600 which are now interpreted as quasi-molecular features associated with the Ly-alpha line. This investigation would combine visual and ultraviolet spectra in order to: (1) Search for possible new ultraviolet features that do not appear in the visible and non-magnetic DA's, (2) Obtain information on the strength of the ultraviolet spectral features as a function of magnetic field, and (3) Compare the observed spectral energy distributions with those derived from model atmospheres. Ultimately, these observations could give new information on the nature of the DA white dwarfs and yield new insight into the structure and properties of their atmospheres.|Y
WDIJH|White Dwarf Lyman Alpha Profiles|Jay B.|Holberg|Arizona|We propose to obtain high quality L-alpha profiles for a selected sample of hot DA white dwarfs, with the intent of establishing accurate effective temperatures. The primary scientific objectives of this program are: 1) the investigation of He abundances in those DAs detected as soft X-ray sources, in particular those observed by EXOSAT, and 2) the investigation of evolutionary effects such as residual nuclear burning, envelope composition and envelope mass. These effects are most evident in the hottest white dwarfs as departures from standard zero-temperature mass radius relationships. The observing and analysis techniques are the same as those used in a recent and successful study of twelve DA white dwarfs covering the temperature range 16,000 to 60,000 K.|Y
WDIPS|Two Year Target of Opportunity: The Low States of Nova-Like Systems|Paula|Szkody|Washington|This target of opportunity proposal will observe novalike cataclysmic variables when they enter low states. During this stage, the mass transfer from the companion virtually ceases, allowing the UV flux to be dominated by the white dwarf rather than the disk. Obtaining a low dispersion SWP and LWP exposure during the low state enables the determination of the white dwarf temperature and gravity through comparison of the L-alpha absorption profile width and the continuum flux distribution with white dwarf models. These temperature determinations provide a direct check on theories of heating/cooling of white dwarfs in close binaries due to accretion or cyclic nova events. Based on numbers during the last year, there should be 6 low states with duration > 1 month during a given year, enabling at least 3 temperature determinations. A two year period is requested in order to gather a larger data base.|Y
WDJDK|Element Abundances in White Dwarfs|Detlev|Koester|Louisiana|Observing time is requested to obtain low-resolution spectra of 8 white dwarfs. 3 objects are hot DA that have been detected by EXOSAT in the EUV/soft X-ray range. IUE spectra will be used to search for lines of any elements other than H(especially HeII) and improve the Teff determination. These data will be used in the interpretation of the EXOSAT observations to determine He abundances. The remaining objects are DC or DQ white dwarfs of lower temperature (8000-10000K), which show only the Swan bands of the C2 molecule or no lines at all in the visible. The aim is to search for lines especially of CI. Mg, and Fe and quantitatively analyse the spectra using model atmospheres. He and metal abundances are known for only a very small number of white dwarfs and provide important clues for the understanding of the mechanisms responsible for white dwarf abundances (accretion - diffusion - convection )|Y
WDJES|IUE Echelle Investigations of V471 Tauri|Edward M.|Sion|Villanova University|We propose a comprehensive IUE echelle investigation of the Hyades, eclipsing-spectroscopic, pre-cataclysmic binary V471 Tauri utilizing SWP and LWP echelle images taken at selected phases around the orbit and velocitycompensated for the orbited motion. The scientific objectives of our proposed program are: (1) to search for the spectral signature of mass loss from the chromospherically very active, rapidly rotating K2 dwarf and resolve the nature of velocity-shifted narrow absorption features observed at coincident velocity, blueward and redward of both the h and k emission cores of MgII; (2) to model for the first time the chromospheric structure of the K2 dwarf using irradition by the white dwarf as a "probe" (3) to confirm the presence of expanding, high velocity, circumbinary gas in the line of sight to V471 Tauri and search for other circumbinary absorption with a full IUE SWP echelle exposure; (4) to search for further evidence of accretion flow and intrasystem gas, strongly implied by EXOSAT soft x-ray oscillation and x-ray dips as well as to confirm and interpret the origin and nature of detected hot gas, co-moving with the white dwarf; (5) to search for the weak absorption signature of accreted metals and/or helium in the Einstein-redshifted rest frame by co-adding two orbital motioncompensated SWP centered at phase 0.25 and 0.75. Our proposed echelle investigations will result in a greater understanding of mass loss from cool dwarfs, the chromospheric structure of cool dwarfs including the effect of rapid rotation and external irradiation, mass and angular momentum loss in a pre-cataclysmic binary, the physics of wind/flare accretion (and diffusion) onto a hot white dwarf, the production mechanism of soft x-ray pulsations associated with the white dwarf and the nature of expanding high velocity gas around the system.|Y
WDJFW|Hot White Dwarfs in the MC Survey|Francois|Wesemael|Canada|To help determine their atmospheric parameters, we propose to obtain low-resolution observations of new, hot white dwarfs. These rare stars have been recently discovered during follow-up spectroscopic observations of ultraviolet-excess objects found in our ongoing survey aimed at increasing the samples of spectroscopically-confirmed hot subdwarfs and white dwarfs in the southern hemisphere (the MontrealCambridge survey). The proposed observations address directly the questions of (1) the highest effective temperature reached by the Hrich degenerate stars and the evolutionary channel followed by these objects, (2) the spectral evolution of white dwarfs and its impact on our understanding of processes such as convective dilution, diffusion, radiative levitation, and stellar winds in these stars, and (3) the luminosity function of hot white dwarfs and its relationship to the weak interaction theory through neutrino emission mechanisms expected to dominate the cooling of hot white dwarfs.|Y
WDJHS|Abundance of DBA White Dwarf Stars|Harry L.|Shipman|Delaware|The recent discovery (Shipman, Liebert, and Green 1967) that a substantial fraction of the white dwarf stars with He-rich photospheres have trace amounts of H, amounts just barely detectable with the optical techniques used, prompts a follow-up study using IUE which is sensitive to much lower H/He ratios. Ground-based observations can detect H/He ~10^-4 or greater, while IUE (using the small aperture) can detect H/He ~10^-8. The origin of this type of white dwarf star, which comprises 20% of all known white dwarf stars with He-rich photospheres, is quite uncertain, and is probably related to the processes which transform white dwarfs with H-rich photospheres into white dwarf stars with He-rich photospheres and vice verse. IUE SWP spectra, taken using the small aperture, are relatively free from geocoronal contamination and are thus sensitive to values of H/He orders of magnitude lower than the ground-based techniques used so far. FiveFi DB stars with no sign of H in them, based on ground-based spectra, will be examined with IUE in order to search for trace H, in order to confirm or exclude the possibility that most or all DB stars contain trace quantities of H. An additional shift will be used to investigate a closely related hotter analog of the DBA stars: Ton 10.|Y
WDJJH|Tests in Diffusion Theory|Jay B.|Holberg|Arizona|We propose to obtain high dispersion SWP images of two hot. hydrogen-rich white dwarfs in an effort to test the predictions of diffusion theory. Diffusion theory would predict that one of our targets, a hot DA high gravity white dwarf, GD 50, should possess a metal-free photosphere. On the other band our second target, PG 1210+533 a DAO white dwarf, is known to have a helium abundance slightly in excess of He/H ~10^-2 and consequently is expected to exhibit a rich array of features due to highly ionized metals, as is seen in many DA (pure K) white dwarfs. Detection of metals in a high gravity object such as OD 50 would not only violate the observed pattern of metal abundances in DAs but would present a difficult dilemma for diffusion theory. Equally puzzling would be a low or metal-free atmosphere in PG 1210+533. Determination of the metal abundances in this star, the only DAO which can be attempted with HE, would also provide a critical intermediate object between the DA& and helium dominated objects such as the DOs, DBs, and PG 1159 objects. Finally there also exists the distinct possibility we may be able to locate the zone of formation of the metal lines (if they exist) in PG1210+533.|Y
WDJNO|Astrometric Binaries: White Dwarfs?|Nancy A.|Oliversen|CSC|We propose to observe a selection of astrometric or spectroscopicastrometric binaries nearer than about 20 pc with unseen low mass companions. Systems of this type are important for determining the luminosity function of low mass stars (white dwarfs and very late main sequence M stars), and their contribution to the total mass of the galaxy. Systems of this type are also important because the low mass, invisible companions are potential candidates in the search for planets.  Our target list is selected primarily from the list of 31 astrometric binaries near the sun by Lippincott (1978, Space Sci. Rev., 22, 153), with additional candidates from recent observations by Kamper. The elimination of stars with previous IUE observations, red companions resolved by infrared speckle interferometry, or primaries later than M1 (because if white dwarf companions are present they should have been detected in the visible region) reduces the list to 5 targets which need further information. IUE SWP low dispersion observations of these targets will show clearly whether the remaining unseen companions are white dwarfs, thus eliminating very cool main sequence stars or planets. This is also important in providing complete statistical information about the nearest stars. The discovery of a white dwarf in such a nearby system would provide important additional information about the masses of white dwarfs.  Recent results by Greenstein (1986, A. J., 92, 859) from binary systems containing white dwarfs imply that 80% of such systems are as yet undetected. The preference of binaries for companions of approximately equal mass makes the Lippincott-Kamper list of A through K primaries with unseen companions a good one to use to search for white dwarfs. The mass and light dominance of the current primary over the white dwarf in the visible makes ultraviolet observations essential to obtain an accurate census of white dwarf binaries.|Y
WDKDK|Element Abundances in White Dwarfs|Detlev|Koester|Louisiana St.|Observing time is requested to obtain low-resolution spectra of 3 white dwarfs of spectral types DC and DQ in the temperature range 8000-10000 K. DQ white dwarfs show only the Swan bands of the C2 molecule, the DC no lines at all in the visible range of the spectrum.  The aim is to search for lines especially of C, Mg, and Fe and quantitatively analyse the spectra using model atmospheres. Because diffusion time scales for heavy elements in white dwarfs are extremely short compared to the evolutionary time scales, the currently accepted picture is that these metals do not reflect the original abundances in the atmospheres of the progenitors, but are produced instead by physical processes in the envelopes in later white dwarf stages. Carbon (in DQ) has probably been brought to the surface by diffusion from layers below the He/C transition, whereas the metals in the spectral type DZ are accreted and diluted by downward diffusion.  Metal abundances are known for only a very small number of white dwarfs, but they provide important clues for the understanding of the physical mechanisms responsible for their appearance accretion, diffusion, and convection.|Y
WDKES|Echelle Studies of the DB Degenerate GD358|Edward M.|Sion|Villanova|Our Tenth Episode high resolution SWP image of the first DB white dwarf (GD358) ever to be observed with the IUE echelle unexpectedly revealed the apparent presence of an Einstein-redshifted C II absorption line at the 200 mA level. If real, this detection is the first of carbon in a hot DB star and should lead to a major breakthrough in our understanding of DB evolution by providing a critical test of the role of convective dredge-up versus interstellar cloud accretion (or radiative levitation) in explaining the presence of carbon in hot DB stars and therefore in their cooler helium-rich, presumed descendants, the class of carbon band DQ degenerates. The resulting carbon abundance would be a direct test of the theoretical prediction of convective dredge-up of core carbon from its equilibrium diffusion tail by Fontaine et al (1984) and by Pelletier et al (1986). It would also provide a clear cut test of convective efficiency/mixing length theory in DB envelopes. Our scientific objective here is two-fold: (1) We must have a confirmatory second SWP image of this hottest (and pulsating prototype) DB in order to confirm this critically important feature and several other somewhat weaker possible photospheric candidates in SWP31432; (2) In order to search further for the presence of trace metals as a test of accretion versus dredge-up and to derive stringent upper limit metal abundances (or abundances from the mix of detected ions) we propose to obtain the first and only LWP high resolution image of a DB. In selecting GD358, we will therefore have complete high resolution IUE coverage of this object in our search for trace metals undetectable at low IUE resolution.|Y
WDKFW|Observations of Hot White Dwarfs in the Montreal-Cambridge (MC) Survey|Francois|Wesemael|Canada|To help determine their atmospheric parameters, we propose to obtain lowresolution observations of new, hot white dwarfs. These rare stars have been recently discovered during follow-up spectroscopic observations of ultravioletexcess objects found in our ongoing survey aimed at increasing the samples of spectroscopically-confirmed hot subdwarfs and white dwarfs in the southern hemisphere (the Montreal-Cambridge survey). The proposed observations address directly the questions of (1) the highest effective temperature reached by the H-rich degenerate stars and the evolutionary channel followed by these objects, (2) the spectral evolution of white dwarfs and its impact on our understanding of processes such as convective dilution, diffusion, radiative levitation, and stellar winds in these stars, and (3) the luminosity function of hot white dwarfs and its relationship to the weak interaction theory through neutrino emission mechanisms expected to dominate the cooling of hot white dwarfs.|Y
WDKJH|High Dispersion Observations of Selected Hot DA White Dwarfs|Jay B.|Holberg|Arizona|We propose to obtain high dispersion SWP images of three hot DA white dwarfs. The primary scientific objective of this research is to establish the circumstances under which narrow interstellarlike metal lines are formed in DA white dwarfs. Previous observations of DA white dwarfs lead us to predict the presence of Si 11, Si III, and possibly Si IV in two of our targets and a general absence of metal features in the third. If these features coincide with the radial velocity of the photosphere, photospheric abundance determinations for these species are possible. If the metal lines are non photospheric we will possess further evidence of selective mass loss from white dwarfs. A secondary objective is to probe additional lines of sight through the local interstellar medium. In particular, one of our targets (Lanning 18) possesses a unique line of sight passing through the densest region of the Local Cloud.|Y
WDLES|Echelle Studies of Physical Processes in Helium-Rich White Dwarfs PG0112+104|Edward M.|Sion|Villanova|In the first IUE high resolution spectrum ever taken of a DB white dwarf, our 1987-88 observation of the hot pulsating DB star GD358, we unexpectedly discovered the presence of redshifted He II (1640) and C II (1335). The detection of He II is in conflict with the present temperature scale of hot DB stars (cf. Liebert et al. 1986; Oke, Weidemann and Koester 1984) and therefore casts doubt on the currently accepted blue edge of the DB instability strip. The detection of photospheric carbon in a DB star hotter than 24000K, is simply inconsistent with the diffusion/convective dredgeup theory of Fontaine et al. (1984). In this mechanism the presence of carbon in a helium-rich degenerate is due to convective dredgeup, at the base of the helium convection zone, of carbon from its equilibrium diffusion tail, extending upward from the carbon core into the helium envelope. The problem is, that in a DB above 24000K like GD358, the convection zone is very shallow and the predicted carbon abundance is essentially zero. The surprising detection and resulting implications of these two ions make it critically important to explore a second hot DB, PG0112+104, a non-pulsator hotter than GD358 and the only other DB even remotely accessible to the IUE echelle. our objectives are: (1) to search for He II (1640) and absorption wings at Lyman Alpha + He II (1215); (2) to search for any evidence of trace metals including carbon in the photosphere (as a test of accretion vs. dredgeup); (3) search for possible mass outflow; (4) place stringent constraints on the carbon abundance in another hot DB; and (5) use the FWHM of detected features to constrain the magnetic field strength and rotational velocity; and (6) test convective efficiency/ mixing length theory in DB envelopes.|Y
WDMAH|Searching for the White Dwarf in Dwarf Novae|Albert V.|Holm|STScI|We will continue cur program to obtain low resolution spectra of dwarf novae in quiescent phase to search for the spectral characteristics of the white dwarf primaries believed to be present in these systems. During this year the program resulted in the discovery of one new apparent hot white dwarf in a dwarf nova system. Analysis of the characteristics of the white dwarf will be used to determine the distance and luminosity of the dwarf nova, to better understand the quiescent spectra, and to provide evidence for the mechanism causing variations in the stellar surface temperature following outburst. The IUE spectra will be taken through the small aperture to avoid contamination by geocoronal Lyman-alpha so that the photospheric Lyman-alpha line can be detected and used to determine the effective temperature of the white dwarf.|Y
WDMDK|UV Observations of the New, Very Hot DA White Dwarf HS1234+4811|Detlev|Koester|Louisiana State|Observing time is requested to obtain low- and high-resolution spectra of a newly identified DA white dwarf (HS1234+4811 = PG1234+481). A preliminary temperature determination of Teff = 60000 K - based on Balmer line profiles - shows this object to be a relatively bright, very hot DA with a reasonably well determined effective temperature in the range of the well known objects G191-11213 and HZ43, and thus a potentially important EUV and soft X-ray candidate for future space experiments. DA white dwarfs with temperatures above 60000 K are extremely rare, whereas several groups of white dwarfs with heliumdominated atmospheres (DO, DAO, PG1159) are known in this range. The reasons for this distribution, which is in sharp contrast with observations at lower temperature, are not understood at present. The primary aims are to obtain an UV energy distribution and a Lyman-alpha profile to improve the temperature determination. In addition we will search for HeII 1640 and metallic features in a high resolution SWP spectrum in order to determine abundances or upper limits.|Y
WDMES|IUE Echelle Investigation of Two Peculiar Helium-Rich Degenerates|Edward M.|Sion|Villanova|We propose to observe two peculiar helium-rich degenerates, the hot hybrid composition DAB star, GD323 and the twin DB degenerate object, PC3146+082 in the IUE high dispersion mode, the first ever IUE echelle images of these spectroscopic types. Both objects occur just below the DO-DB temperature gap (in which no DB or cool DO stars are seen), have an energy distribution and color temperature similar to the twin DB degenerate interacting cataclysmic binary, AM CVn, and both may be related in a still unknown way, to the origin of hot single DB stars, which show the onset of non-radial g-mode pulsations near Teff = 30,OOOK (cf. Liebert, et al. 1986). Our specific scientific objectives for GD323 are: (1) to search for evidence of neutral and/or ionized metal absorption features formed in and/or above the photosphere, or as shortward-shifted wind absorption features, undetectable at low IUE resolution, as a means of establishing the role of either interstellar accretion, convective dredgeup, radiative levitation, mass loss or recent accretion in an interacting binary, in understanding the nature of this hybrid object; (3) to look for weak He II absorption as a means of resolving its temperature (its spectroscopic and calorimetric temperature fits are discrepant with 40,OOOK needed to fit H-beta); (4) to determine metal abundances from the analysis of any detected features or set stringent abundance constraints for metals, especially carbon, which is theoretically predicted to have a very small non-zero abundance based upon calculations of helium convective dredgeup of core carbon from its equilibrium diffusion tail; (5) to use IUE echelle detections to derive an upper limit rotation rate and upper limit magnetic field strength, two other factors which may be implicated in its hybrid composition (via inhibited gravitational settling); to compare its IUE echelle spectrum with those of the hottest DB stars, GD358 (which unexpectedly showed photospheric He II and C II) and PG0112+102 (to be observed). Our scientific objectives in observing PG13464082 are: (1) to look for any evidence of circumstellar/circumbinary gas in the form of either shortward-shifted or longward-shifted CNO absorption/emission features, undetectable at low IUE resolution, as a basis of comparison with the two other similar helium-transfer cataclysmics, all with pure helium optical spectra but showing CNO ions in the IUE range, G61-29 (carbon deficient, nitrogen-rich) which resembles spectroscopically, the classical nova binary V 603 Aquila (Lambert and Slovak 1981) and the similar system A M C Vn, which shows far ultraviolet (IUE) evidence of a hot wind (Solheim and Kjeldseth-Moe), suggesting that high resolution spectra of PGJ346+082 may reveal an ancient nova shell, circumbinary matter connected with the formation process or the binary, or mass outflow from the inner disk/boundary layer region. Our IUE echelle observation of PG1346+082 would enable detection of circumbinary shell/ wind absorption line features as weak as 40-60 mA, as well as weak emission, with a wavelength (velocity) scale accurate to less than 5 km/s.|Y
WDNGB|Temperatures of Hot DA White Dwarfs|Gibor S.|Basri|UC Berkeley|We propose to complete the program which we began last year of observing the remaining hot (Teff > 30,000 K) DA white dwarfs which are observable with IUE. The main purpose is to obtain the effective temperatures of the targets. The temperatures will be needed for successful analysis of the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) data which will be obtained for numerous hot DA white dwarfs by the EUV Explorer sky survey mission. The IUE observations include small aperture SWP observations which are being used for temperature and gravity determinations based on fitting the Lyman-alpha line profile. Ground-based observations are also being made of the Balmer lines of these stars, giving an independent temperature and gravity measurement. With the complete data sets, we will be able to detect attenuation due to dust absorption, and in some cases may be able to directly measure the neutral hydrogen column. We also intend to use the combined Balmer and Lyman-alpha line profile measurements to attempt to detect the presence of stratification of the atmospheres of the white dwarfs. Determination of HeII 1640 A and 4686 A line strengths (or upper limits) will also be used as a stratification indicator. Half of the 24 targets are expected to be observed during the 13th Episode (three, to date). The time being requested for the 14th Episode is required to observe the remainder of the targets.|Y

WDNSK|What is the Amount of Hydrogen at the Surface of a White Dwarf?|S. O.|Kepler|U Montreal|We propose to measure the short-wavelength ultraviolet energy distribution of 3 non-variable stars with colors inside the ZZ Ceti (DAV) instability strip, to derive accurate effective temperature for these stars. The scientific objective is to test if these stars have temperatures inside the instability strip for the ZZ Ceti stars, which would indicate that they have a surface hydrogen layer more massive than 10^-7 M(sun).|Y
WDNSV|The Phase Variation of the Ultraviolet Spectrum of Feige 24|Stephane|Vennes|U Delaware|The hydrogen-rich (DA) white dwarf Feige 24 (WD 0232+035, EG 20) is part of a spectroscopic binary system comprising also a red dwarf star (dM1-2), and characterized by an orbital period of 4.23 days. The white dwarf is very hot and is a well-known EUV/soft X-ray source. This white dwarf is also one of the hot hydrogen-rich degenerate stars showing in the UV range narrow lines from highly-ionized heavy elements. Observations in the optical range have demonstrated that the M dwarf is subject to intense EUV illumination from the hot white dwarf which results in strong phase dependent H-alpha and He I line emissions, This variability is simply due to a projection effect and allows a study of the orbital parameters. Continuous observations of the M dwarf has provided us with a very precise ephemeris (unpublished) of the system which can be profitably used to study the DA white dwarf. We report in this proposal a study of the orbital parameters (mass and velocity) and physical parameters (gravitational redshift and radius) of the white dwarf based on existing IUE high-dispersion spectra. We propose to complete the data set, by monitoring one orbital period, which should result in a very significant improvement of our knowledge of the Feige 24 system.|Y
WDOGB|Observations of EUVE Survey White Dwarf Suspects|Gibor S.|Basri|UC Berkeley|The Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer (EUVE) is currently planned to be launched in May 1992, and will perform an all-sky photometric survey in the EUV (70-700 A) during the period of July through December of 1992. EUVE will detect a few hundred hot white dwarfs hotter than about 25,000 K, a significant fraction of which will be members of unresolved binary systems. The white dwarfs in binaries present a particular problem. EUV detection is. not at all biased by the presence of a normal star companion. However, spectroscopic identification of the optical counterpart to a white dwarf EUV source is very difficult using optical spectroscopy if the white dwarf has a main sequence or somewhat evolved companion unless the companion is later than early M. We propose to use IUE to observe optical counterparts to EUV sources which are suspected to have hot white dwarf companions; IUE can detect the presence of a hot white dwarf even if the primary star is as early as A0. We will also use the IUE data to determinate the white dwarfs' solid angle, temperature, and gravity, which are essential for the proper analysis and interpretation of the EUV data so that the white dwarf chemical compositions and the neutral interstellar columns may also be determined. For the upcoming episode, we are requesting IUE time for observing only the first 10 or so of the perhaps 100 or more systems we expect to find which would be suspected of harboring hot white dwarfs.|Y
WDOJH|IUE Echelle Spectra of a EUV Selected Sample of Bright DA White Dwarfs|Jay B.|Holberg|U Arizona|We propose to obtain high dispersion IUE SWP spectra of six, bright, hot white DA dwarfs newly discovered as EUV sources by the ROSAT Wide Field Camera. Recent studies of twenty DA white dwarfs detected by ROSAT reveal that it is not possible to account for the observed EUV and soft X-ray fluxes with simple He opacity alone. Until now virtually all analyses of DA soft X-ray observations have been interpreted in terms of trace He abundances, in either a homogeneous or stratified photosphere. It is now clear that other opacity sources will be required to interpret these observations, in particular opacity due to metal ions. Our proposed observations will seek direct evidence that such ions are indeed responsible for the soft X-ray opacity in these stars. We also will obtain large and small aperture spectra of each star in order to accurately establish the temperatures and gravities.|Y
WDPES|IUE Echelle Studies of Very Hot DA and DB White Dwarfs from the Edinburgh-Cape Survey|Edward M.|Sion|Villanova University|We propose to obtain high dispersion IUE SWP spectra of two bright, newly discovered very hot DA white dwarfs, EC2004-605 and EC1148-230 (both of comparable temperature to G191-B2B and HZ43) and a rare hot DB star, EC0001-246, all three from the EdinburghCape Survey. Only a handful of hot DAs have been observed well enough to clearly identify weak (EW < 100 mA) ion features, and each object has offered differing and surprising line detections. It is not possible to develop a global picture of the connection between the presence of trace metals and basic parameters (e.g., log g and Log Teff) unless we observe more hot DAs with ionized metals, arising in either the photosphere (e.g., G191-B2B, Feige 24), circumstellar shell (e.g., GD394, W1346), weak wind (e.g., G191B2B?) or metals completely absent (e.g., HZ43). The detection of photospheric metals in hot DA stars is critical to understanding the observed EUV/soft X-ray flux from hot DA stars since ROSAT studies have shown that helium opacity alone, in a homogeneous or stratified photosphere, cannot explain the high energy flux deficiency. Mixes of trace metals, either radiatively levitated or accreted in the photosphere, are the leading candidates for the soft X-ray/EUV opacity. Our IUE echelle analysis in velocity space will also determine whether the hot DA stars have weak winds, circumstellar shells or static/slowly expanding halos which should be manifest if they are responsible for the thinning of hydrogen layers required by pulsation theory.  Do hot DB stars originate from cooling hot DA stars which undergo convective mixing away of a superficial hydrogen layer? In a hot DB star, the detection of ionized metals at the Einstein-redshifted rest frame of the photosphere could indicate radiative levitation or accretion while shortward-shifted absorption could indicate weak wind outflow or a circumstellar shell or halo, all of which would have important implications for either the hot DA - hot DB convective mixing scenario or the genesis of hot DB stars from an evolutionary channel different than the hot DA stars. We also will obtain large and small aperture IUE SWP spectra of each star just prior to the echelle exposures in order to accurately establish their temperatures and gravities and assure well-centered targets for the longer exposure high dispersion images.|Y
WDPHS|The Highest Quality Ultraviolet Spectrum of 40 Eri B|Harry L.|Shipman|U Delaware|A next logical step in understanding the bright white dwarf 40 Eri B is obtaining the beat possible ultraviolet spectrum which can be obtained with current instrumentation. Interestingly, the brightness of this star and the characteristics of its spectrum dictate that IUE rather than HST is the instrument to do this job.  40 Eri B has not been thoroughly observed by IUE, in particular at high dispersion. I propose to use new schemes to reduce the fixed-pattern noise in IUE spectra and obtain additional high dispersion observations, improving the data quality from signal/noise of around 15-20 to 60 or possibly 100. These observations can significantly improve our experimental tests of a Nobel-Prize winning theory of relativistic degeneracy, search for circumstellar gas which has been observed in hotter white dwarfs, test a new atomic physics theoretical prediction of the broadening of quasimolecular features near 1400 and 1600 A, and potentially isolate a few spectral regions for intensive study with HST.|Y
WDPJH|High Signal-to-Noise Echelle Spectra of Two Remarkable New White Dwarfs|Jay B.|Holberg|U Arizona|We propose to obtain additional SWP echelle spectra of two remarkably bright and metal-rich hot DA white dwarfs, RE 2214-49 and RE 0623-37. These additional echelle spectra will be used to form unique high signal-to-noise spectra for these two stars, as recently has been done for G191 B2B and Feige 24. Our 15th epoch results indicate that these new DA stars are hotter and more metal-rich than G191 B2B and Feige 24. Our high signal-to-noise spectra should reveal a host of additional features at the 10-15 mA level, in particular those of Fe V and Fe VI. They will be used to establish a selfconsistent model of the photospheres of these two stars, which have the steepest EUV cutoff of any DA's in the ROSAT survey.|Y
WDPMH|IUE Echelle Investigation of the Peculiar Helium-Rich Degenerate, PG 1346+0 82|Min|Huang|Villanova University|We propose to observe the peculiar helium-rich, AM CVn-type, twin DB degenerate object, PG 3146+082 in the IUE high dispersion mode, the second ever successful IUE echelle image of this spectroscopic type. This object occurs just below the DODB temperature gap (in which no DB or cool DO stars are seen), has an energy distribution and color temperature similar to the twin DB degenerate interacting cataclysmic binary, AM CVn, and may be related in a still unknown way to the origin of hot single DB stars, which show the onset of non-radial g-mode pulsations near Teff = 30,000K (cf. Liebert, et al. 1986). Our scientific objectives in observing PG1346+082 are: (1) to look for any evidence of circumstellar/circumbinary gas in the form of either shortward-shifted or longward-shifted CNO absorption/emission features, undetectable at low IUE resolution, as a basis of comparison with the two other similar helium-transfer cataclysmics, all with pure helium optical spectra but showing CNO ions in the IUE range, G61-29 (carbon deficient, nitrogen-rich) which resembles spectroscopically, the classical nova binary V603 Aquila (Lambert and Slovak 1981) and the similar system AM CVn, which shows far ultraviolet (IUE) evidence of a hot wind (Solheim and Kjeldseth-Moe), suggesting that high resolution spectra of PG1346+082 may reveal an ancient nova shell, circumbinary matter connected with the formation process of the binary, or mass outflow from the inner disk/boundary layer region. Our IUE echelle observation of PG1346+082 would enable detection of circumbinary shell/wind absorption line features as weak as 40-60 mA, as well as weak emission, with a wavelength (velocity) scale accurate to less than 5 km/s. In AM CVn our IUE echelle image shows He II and N V (1238, 1242) in strong complex absorption indicating a hot shelf, gas rings, or a hot common envelope.|Y
WDQJH|High Signal-to-Nose Echelle Spectra of Key White Dwarfs|Jay|Holberg|University of Arizona|We propose to use the 17th episode of IUE to obtain high signal-to-noise (S/N) SWP echelle spectra for a set of key hot white dwarfs. Each of our targets has already been shown to exhibit critical aspects of white dwarf physics, such as extremely high or low photospheric metal content or strong evidence of the existence of circumstellar material. In addition to the stars themselves, information revealed concerning their interstellar lines of sight can be used in combination with forthcoming direct measurements of H I and He I columns from the Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer to obtain accurate abundance ratios for C, N, O and Si within the very local interstellar medium. Our observations are intended to provide a total (including existing archival images) of four or more well-exposed echelle spectra of each target. These spectra will be carefully coadded and result in S/N in excess of 20 or 30, where features with equivalent widths as low as 10 to 15 mA can be confidently identified. Many important weak features such as those due to Fe and Ni are only evident at this level.|Y
WDRWL|The White Dwarf Luminosity Function in F-K Binaries|Wayne B.|Landsman|Hughes - STX|The white dwarf luminosity function is our most sensitive probe of the star formation history of the Galactic disk, but its use requires an estimate of the white dwarf binary fraction. The recent ROSAT EUV survey has shown that hot white dwarfs optically hidden in close binary systems can contribute significantly to the white dwarf luminosity function.  We show that the TD-1 all-sky ultraviolet survey should detect most white dwarfs in binary systems with a 1565 A flux larger than 10^-12 erg/cm2/sec/A. We have identified the 33 nearby late-type stars in the TD-1 survey with (1) at least 3 sigma detections at 1565 A, (2) negligible 1565 A flux expected from the late-type component, (3) no known hot stars within the TD-1 entrance slot, and (4) no existing SWP spectra. We propose to obtain lowdispersion SWP images of these stars to search for subluminous hot companions, and then model the spectra of any detected white dwarfs to determine their effective temperatures and gravities. Our UV survey of white dwarfs in late-type binaries will complement the EUV surveys of EUVE and ROSAT, which are more sensitive but suffer from strong selection effects due to interstellar absorption and trace EUV metal opacity.|Y

WGPPC|Spectral Synthesis of Wolf-Rayet Galaxies|Peter S.|Conti|Colorado - CASA|Emission-line  galaxies are those whose spectra results primarily from the presence of a large number of O-type stars. Wolf-Rayet galaxies are a subset of emission-line galaxies in which there is evidence for the existence of hundreds to thousands of Wolf-Rayet stars; these objects are examples of some of the youngest starburst systems. We are currently engaged in an extensive observational and theoretical study of Wolf-Rayet galaxies. Ultraviolet spectra are essential to this study as they provide additional constraints on the hot star populations in these objects. We are requesting six IUE US1 observing shifts to obtain low dispersion short wavelength ultraviolet spectra of five Wolf-Rayet galaxies. These data will complement previously acquired optical and IUE spectra and will be analyzed using spectral synthesis models. By modeling the ultraviolet and optical spectra of these galaxies we hope to determine their properties and distinguishing characteristics, deduce their stellar populations and initial mass functions, and derive information about their evolutionary history.|Y

WNLPC|Wolf-Rayet Stars of WN Subtype|Peter S.|Conti|Colorado - CASA|The spectra of WN type stars are dominated by helium and nitrogen emission lines formed in strong stellar winds. Recent improved modeling of these winds, combined with extensive optical spectral data, indicate that the actual line strengths are reasonably well behaved and can be understood in terms of the current theory.  It now becomes important to extend the data base to the UV lines which can be observed with IUE, particularly the (3-2) HeII transition at 1640 A. The strength of this line with respect to the (4-3) transition at 4686 A and the (5-4) transition at 10124 A is a significant diagnostic of the models. We have already published measurements of the 4686 A emission feature for nearly all the known Galactic, LMC and SMC WN stars and are currently analyzing the near IR line at 10124 A for a significant number of these. It should be noted that SWP IUE data for some of these stars already exist in the IUE archives, but in a number of cases the exposure times, while correct for the continuum, resulted in overexposure of the leading emission features.  We are therefore requesting six IUE US2 observing shifts in order to obtain low dispersion short wavelength spectra of a number of WN stars in our Galaxy and the LMC for which either NO IUE data exist or the previously obtained images have overexposed emission lines. These spectra will be used to continue a detailed quantitative study of the helium emission line spectra of WN type stars from the UV to the near IR. A comparison of the spectra of the stars in our Galaxy with those of stars in the LMC and SMC will enable us to examine the relationship, if any, between the stellar wind spectrum and the model parameters for objects with differing initial compositions. The IUE data to be newly acquired here will be combined with existing archival information to provide a significant sample for the analysis.|Y
WNNPC|Multi-Wavelength Study of HD50896 (WN+C?) Origin of its Variability|Peter S.|Conti|Colorado - CASA|We propose to secure a further time sequence of SWP HIRES spectra of HD 50896 (WN5+c?) for the first time to be coordinated with simultaneous optical spectroscopy, photometry and polarimetry, and (possibly) ROSAT X-ray observations, in order to unambiguously determine the origin(s) of its known variability at these wavelengths. HD 50896 has been one of the more promising WR+n.s. candidate systems, baud an observations of a 3^d.7 periodicity of optical radial velocity and light variations. However, this scenario has been questioned through the lack of high levels of X-ray emission, and the long-term nature of its polarisation variability. Our previous TUB studies of the star have revealed UV P Cygni profile variability with 'event' tin and decay, and recurrence timescales of ~1 day, suggestive of an origin intrinsic to the WN5 wind, and possible caused by radiative-induced wind instabilities. There is no observed UV Hatchett & McCray effect seen in our IUE data. It is clear that HD 50896 is highly variable at all observed wavelengths; the variability character is highly epochdependent in all measurable variables; and it is potentially possible that different mechanism we responsible for the wavelength-dependent changes (binarity, single star rotation-surface inhomogenities, intrinsic wind instabilities). To date, there has been no coordinated multi-wavelength study of its variability. At the recent IAU Symposium held in Indonesia in June 1990 on WR star and interrelations with other massive stars is galaxies, a working group was established with the objective of securing simultaneous, multi-wavelength observations of HD 50896. It was agreed there that only through such a coordinated campaign could one hope to determine the true nature of this object. The present proposal is to provide the UV line profile variability component of this study, essential to the prosecution of the overall programme objective.|Y
WNOPC|Spectroscopy of Of/WN Star in M33|Peter S.|Conti|Colorado - CASA|In a recent study of optical spectra of Wolf-Rayet stars in M33 we have discovered an object, MCA-1b, whose optical spectrum closely resembles that of the Of/WN9 star R84 in the LMC (Willis, Schild & Smith, 1991). We propose to secure a SWP+LWP ultraviolet spectrum of MCA-lb to complement our optical data, which will be analysed together using the state-of-the art, non- LTE moving atmosphere models now available at University College London. We will determine the physical and chemical properties of MCA-Ib from a detailed analysis similar to that carried out for R84 by Schmutz et al. (1991). The UV data will allow us to model the observed continuum energy distribution from 11509000 A, allowing an accurate determination of Teff, L*, Mbol, and R*, through model atmosphere fitting. The UV region is crucial in this respect, since the optical range alone is not sufficient to constrain models for objects with Teff >15000 K.|Y
WNPPC|Spectroscopy of Wolf-Rayet Stars of Type WN|Peter S.|Conti|Colorado - CASA|The emission line spectra of WN stars are dominated by helium and nitrogen transitions formed in strong stellar winds. It is important to fully characterize the behavior of the lines and continua over an extended wavelength range. The IUE UV region is critical to this effort, since (1) it contains important strong lines (He II 1640, 2733, 3203; C IV 1548,50; N V 1240; N IV 1718) that can be compared to optical and NIR emission lines for diagnosing the model line predictions, and (2) intrinsic continuum properties rely on accurate color excesses, which can be derived by nulling the 2175 A interstellar absorption feature. These data will complement optical and NIR spectra already available to us, and add to our already existing IUE studies.  We are requesting six US1 and four US2 observing shifts in order to obtain low dispersion spectra of 29 LMC and 3 Galactic WN stars for which we already have optical and near IR spectrophotometry and either (1) NO previous SWP and/or LWP data exist, or (2) the only data available for a given wavelength region are considerably underexposed. The majority of our proposed targets fall into the first category. These spectra will be used to complete a detailed quantitative study of the emission line and continuum spectra of the WN type stars from the UV to the NIR. A comparison of the spectra of the stars in our Galaxy with those of the stars in the LMC and SMC will enable us to examine the relationship, if any, between the stellar wind spectrum and the model parameters for objects with differing initial compositions.   |Y
WONJH|Continuum and UV Extinction in O Stars in M33 and M31|John B.|Hutchings|DAO|We wish to obtain IUE low dispersion spectra of WR and O stars in M31 and M33 to complement and support HST spectroscopy in our GTO and GO program. IUE data will principally be used to fit continuum and extinction models. The stars are of earlier type and are marginally more reddened than stars observed in previous programs by us. The purpose is to study stars whose winds should be strongest and whose extinction is sufficient to define the UV extinction curve better. The IUE fluxes are more reliable than HST, cover the wavelength range to 3200A, and are needed to estimate the HST observing exposures. Previous results have indicated that winds and UV extinction in both M33 and M31 are similar to the LMC, a surprising result given the high metallicity of M31 compared with M33 and the LMC.|Y
WRCCW|Variability in Wolf-Rayet Stars|Chi-Chao|Wu|CSC|We propose to observe HD 50896,, WN5, single-line spectroscopic binary (SB), P=3^d.76, possibly compact secondary; HD 214419, WN7, single-line SB, P = 1^d.64, eclipsing,, strange secondary; HD 96543, WN8, variable; and HD 76530, WC6, variable. Three shifts are requested, to be linked with three-shift blocks of van der Hucht (ESA) and Burton (SRC) to form a single observing run of three, consecutive days. It is the purpose of this study to investigate the orbital effects, local variations in Te, ne,  log g and the mass loss of  both the primary and secondary as the possible cause(s) of the observed variations. The nature of the secondary and the evolutionary status of these stars will be explored. For single stars, the possible connection between variability and stellar wind will be investigated.|Y
WRCHC|UV Study of WR Stars Associated with Ring-Nebulae in the LMC|Y. H.|Chu|UC Berkeley|Eight WR stars surrounded by ring-nebulae have recently been discovered in the Large Magellanic Cloud (Chu, 1979). These ring-nebulae are similar in morphology to their Galactic counterparts, NGC6888, NGC2359, NCC3199, S308, etc., except they are much larger; the Galactic ring-nebulae associated with WR stars typically have diameter 10 pc or less, while those in the LMC have diameter from 20 pc to 200 pc. If we believe that these ring-nebulae are windblown bubbles, the size is proportional to (wind strength/ambient gas density)^x , x = 1/5 if age is constant, x = 1/2 if temperature is constant. The gas density in the LMC, implied by neutral hydrogen column density distribution or H-alpha emissivity, apparently is not adequate to account for the differences in size; the stellar wind strength then becomes an important consideration. A Fabry-Perot interferometric study of the expansion velocity of these ring-nebulae will be performed in the coming LMC season, and the gas density in the shell will be estimated from B. Lasker's H-alpha plates; with the information of radius, expansion velocity, and density, we will be able to use bubble theory (Weaver et al., 1977) to derive wind strength. Stellar wind information obtained from UV observation of the central WR stars would serve as a crucial test for the validity of the bubble theory.|Y
WRCJR|Study of the NGC 6888 Nebula and the WR Star HD 192163|J.|Rahe|NASA/GSFC| The nebula NGC 6888. and its relation to the WR star ED 192163 will be studied. For this purpose, one exposure of the star at short and long wavelength will be made together with 4 spectra of the nebula taken at different positions in the nebula which coincide with already existing optical observations.  Various theories have been published about the objects, but there are still a number of basic questions to be answered. Especially the following problems will be addressed: - The UV emission lines in the WR star will be studied in order to, derive the basic properties of the central star and its relation to the nebula. Different authors find values for the effective temperature of the star between 30.000 and 60.000 K; it seems to be a factor of two above the value commonly accepted for WN6 type stars like HD 192163. Estimates for the photosphere radius range from 13 to 70 R; the radius is important for the determination of many derived quantities since the dilution factor depends on the radius for the ionizing radiation. The basic assumption of black body distribution around 912 A needs verification.  - The anomalous chemical abundances in the nebula -especially the extremely important Cabundance - will be studied.  - The structure and origin of the different filaments observed in the nebula will be investigated. The ionization state and abundance ratios of different ions vary for different filaments.  - The formation of the nebula (supernova remnant, planetary nebula, HD 192163 remnant, etc.) will be studied.|Y
WRCWR|An Investigation of the Intrinsic Properties of Wolf-Rayet Stars|William M.|Rumpl|NASA/GSFC|The present system for classifying Wolf-Rayet stars is based on the relative strengths of certain visual emission lines.  Because these lines originate in the stellar winds of Wolf-Rayet stars, this classification system may not be related to the intrinsic properties of these stars. In the literature there exists evidence both for and against such a relationship. Part of the reason for this uncertainty is the lack sufficient data, particularly in the ultraviolet, for a large number of these stars. It is the purpose of this investigation to observe a representative number of these stars in the ultraviolet with the aid of IUE and to analysis this data (in conjunction with available visual and infrared data) in order to determine whether or not a relationship exists between a Wolf-Rayet star's subclass and its intrinsic properties. Because of the large scope that a comprehensive study would have, this initial investigation will focus on the subclasses WN 5, WN 6, WC 6, and WC 9.|Y

We propose to use these techniques to analyze the atmospheric eclipses by the Wolf-Rayet components of V444 Cyg and CV Ser and the eclipse of the Wolf-Rayet component V444 Cyg.  Observations in stron ultraviolet lines will be interpreted using computer programs developed by Cherepashchuk to model binary systems with a Wolf-Rayet component.|Y
WRDJH|A Study of Shell Structures Associable with Wolf-Rayet Stars|Joy|Heckathorn|CSC|Forty-eight Wolf-Rayet stars have been visually associated with shell structures from the plate material of The Emission Line Survey of the Milky Way. Previous IUE investigations have revealed both shifted and unshifted interstellar components in Wolf-Rayet stars. In addition, some Wolf-Rayet stars show exceedingly strong equivalent widths in the interstellar features of C IV and Si IV. We propose, using high dispersion SWP images, to study the sharp resonance features in a sample of the "shell" Wolf-Rayet stars, paying particular attention to shortward shifted components presumably arising in the shell structures. A specific example is presented using an existing IUE spectrum of HD 50896. The velocities of the shortward shifted sharp components are inversely related to the required ionization potential of the ion. These observed shifted features are consistent with the view that they are formed in a shock interface between the stellar wind and the surrounding interstellar gas.  We expect to accomplish three objectives with this program: 1) Determine whether the observed velocity shifts are a function of ionization potential in other Wolf-Rayet stars.  2) Map the dichotomy of the equivalent widths of "unshifted" C IV and Si IV among Wolf-Rayet stars.  3). Use column densities, velocity shifts and observed shell radii to discriminate between photoionization and interstellar bubble models for the shells.|Y
WRDLA|Wind-Wind Interactions in Wolf-Rayet Binaries|Lawrence|Auer|Penn University|Wolf-Rayet and O stars are known to have large rates of mass loss. We propose phase dependent observations of eclipsing binaries containing a WR and an O star. The results should enable one to model the interactions of the winds. As a side benefit knowing the separation of the objects, one can comment on the rate of acceleration before the winds collide.|Y
WRDPM|Eclipsing and Low Mass Funciton Wolf-Rayet Binaries|Philip L.|Massey|Dominion Astrophysical Observatory|We plan to observe the brightest eclipsing W-R binaries through their eclipses, and the W-R binaries with low mass companions with extensive phase coverage. These data will provide important, unique information on the structure of W-R envelopes, as well as testing the claim that the companions of three W-R stars are collapsed objects.|Y
WREPC|Continuum Measures of Wolf-Rayet Stars with IUE|Peter|Conti|University of Colorado|Analysis of the temperatures and other parameters of Wolf-Rayet (W-R) stars has been hampered by the lack of information about their flux distribution over a broad spectral region. Conventional photometric techniques cannot be used to deredden their spectra due to the uncertainties in correcting for the strong emission lines. We propose to determine the interstellar reddening in a number of W-R stars through IUE observations of the 2200 bump in their spectra. These dereddened spectra will be analysed in conjunction with optical spectrophotometry of the same stars currently being obtained at KPNO and CTIO by Dr. Massey (DAO) and PSC.  The technique of nulling the effect of the 2200 interstellar absorption has been applied to a few stars by others, but it is important to extend the complete analysis to a large number of W-R stars, including multiple stars of the same spectral sub-class. The unreddened continua of W-R stars have not yet been established, but there is evidence that the continuum shape varies even among stars of the same spectral subtype. Our data will be used to explore these differences, as well as other differences in emission line strength, absolute magnitude, and the presence or absence of hydrogen in the W-R spectra.|Y
WRFPC|UV Spectral Variations of HD 50896 (WN 5+?)|Peter S.|Conti|Colorado|It is proposed to obtain high resolution spectra of HD 50896 (currently the most promising WR+collapsar candidate) over its 3.7 day binary cycle, with good phase resolution, in order to study in detail the spectral variations apparent in the stellar wind P Cygni profiles discovered with previous IUE data. Our analysis of IUE archive material of this star (obtained by others) at scattered epochs over 1978-81 shows significant variations (a factor of two) in the strengths of the absorption and emission components to several lines. These variations appear to have some phase dependence, but the current phase coverage do not sufficiently cover an individual binary cycle to tie down their origin. Nevertheless the observed variations do seem similar to those observed in massive X-ray binary systems, and if confirmed in HD 50896 would give strong support to the existence of WR+collapsar systems which has recently been severely questioned. Further evidence for WR+collapsar systems would thus strengthen the whole stellar evolutionary scenario discussed by van den Heuvel for massive binary systems, in which WR+collapsars form a natural extension over the production of X-ray binaries. Since available data for HD 50896 suggest there may be some secular changes as well, it is necessary to monitor the system with good phase resolution over a single cycle. We are thus proposing for sufficient IUE time from both IUEAC and NASA to allow contiguous scheduling and accommodate these crucial observations. In addition we propose to use some of the time to monitor two other WN+collapsar candidates, HD 192163 and HD 96548 which have similar (~4 day) periods.|Y
WRFWK|Wolf-Rayet Stars in NGC 5430|William C.|Keel|Aura|The barred spiral galaxy NGC 5430 has been found to contain a starforming region, about 6 kpc from the nucleus, with conspicuous Wolf-Rayet features in optical spectra. If these features are due to WR stars like those seen locally, about 3x10^4 are present in a region only a few hundred parsecs across. Dilution of their light by that of a comparable number of O stars makes it difficult to determine the WN/WC mixture, and determine whether the WR stars are like those seen locally. This is a proposal to measure the UV resonance lines of C and N, and possibly their profiles, as a way of addressing these points, The results could suggest mechanism for producing such massive starbursts and provides clues to their evolution.|Y
WRFWR|An Investigation of the Binary Nature of the Wolf-Rayet Star HD 50896|William M.|Rumpl|CSC|We propose to observe the Wolf-Rayet Star HD 50896, WN5, which has been suggested as being a single-line spectroscopic binary whose period is 3.763 days and whose unseen companion might possibly be a compact object. Existing IUE observations, while suggestive of a possible binary nature, do not give the complete and continuous phase coverage required to determine the nature of this star. Therefore, the equivalent of six US2 shifts are requested, which will be divided into sixteen three-hour sessions; the period of observation spanning twenty-three days. This observation scheme will provide complete and sufficiently continuous phase coverage of HD 50896 (every integral tenth phase plus repeatability checks) from which the binary nature of this star can be more firmly established, the influence of the unseen secondary on the WR star's stellar wind can be investigated, and the nature of the companion can be explored.|Y
WRGAU|A High-Resolution Spectrophotometric Study of the WR Binary System V444 Cygni|Anne B.|Underhill|NASA/GSFC|The binary system V444 Cygni (P = 4.212424 day) is an important object for determining the sizes and masses of 0 and WR stars. However, no spectrographic studies of its orbit have been made since 1950. The orbital elements given by Munch (1950) require confirmation, especially the elements describing the motion of the WR star. Spectrophotometric observations from the ground by Kuhi (1968) indicate that the system is enveloped in high-temperature gas which may be streaming between the stars.  Review of the four (3 SWP, I LWR) high-resolution spectrograms of this system taken previously by others indicates that absorption lines attributable to the O star occur in the wavelength range from 1700 to 1900A, and that rather sharp absorption components associated with the C II resonance lines and with N IV 1718 occur on some of the spectrograms, but not on others.  It is planned to follow V444 Cygni through one orbital cycle obtaining spectra throughout both eclipses and at the elongations. Observations will be made with the SWP camera using the spectrograph in the highresolution mode and with the large aperture. The resulting series of spectra will permit us to confirm and improve the orbital elements of Munch, and to track what, if any, streams of gas occur in the system. Improved orbital elements will allow us to deduce improved sizes and masses for the two stars.  Analysis of the blended spectra and comparisons with the spectra of single stars having equivalent spectral types to those of the components of V444 Cygni will allow us to infer information about the physical state of the atmosphere of each star. Appropriate comparison spectra of single stars exist in NSSDC. The P.I. has copies of some of them.|Y
WRGCG|Continuum Shapes of Wolf-Rayet Stars|Catharine D.|Garmany|Colorado|We are proposing to continue the investigation of continuum flux distributions of Wolf-Rayet stars from IUE and ground-based scanner observations. Wolf-Rayet stars make a major contribution to the overall luminosity and chemical enrichment of the galaxy', and have the largest mass loss rates of any known stars. However the mechanism driving their wind is not understood, and the variations observed in mass, luminosity and line strength within the same spectral subtypes lead one to question the evolutionary significance of these types. Initially, we hoped to derive effective temperatures and radii from the energy distribution and then sort out the other parameters. Instead, we found that reddening, possibly circumstellar, prevented this. We want to circumvent the reddening problem by observing W-R stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud, where the interstellar reddening is low, and differences from star to star may tell us primarily about circumstellar extinction and continua shapes. The brighter W-R stars in the LMC have already been observed with IUE, but the discovery by Massey and Conti that there is a three mag. spread in the absolute magnitudes of the single WN stars requires observation of some fainter stars.  We also want to consider the relation between the continua and the radio mass loss. Only half of the stars with radio observations have IUE data, which is vital for providing wind terminal velocities. Additional observations of fainter W-R stars are necessary to insure that the radio mass loss rates which all lie in a very narrow range, do not suffer from a selection effect.|Y
WRGLA|Phase Dependent Variations in Wolf-Rayet Binaries: Wind Structures|Lawrence|Auer|Lanl|We propose observation of the Wolf-Rayet + O Star binary systems HD 90657, HD 186943, HD 211854, HD 97152, and HD 155270 at orbital phases in which the O component undergoes selective atmospheric eclipse by the WR wind. Because these particular systems have nearly zero orbital inclination, the varying absorption of the O Star spectrum as a function of impact parameter can be used to derive the optical depth distribution in the winds of the WR's. Each system will be observed in the lowdispersion mode during US2 shifts. These observations will be combined with archival data to achieve adequate phase coverage for the wind structure analysis. Possible wind-wind collision effects will also be studied.  The work being proposed is an extension of our previous WRDLA research. We wish, in particular, to make observations at small impact parameters to gain information on the initial acceleration of the WR wind, and to make similar observation of several WC stars. One of the results of our previous work was the striking similarity in the outer parts of the flows of the five WN systems then observed. We will determine now if there are, however, observational differences between the WC and WN flows, and in the inner parts of the WN flows.|Y
WRHCG|Rapid Variability in W-R Stars: Evidence for Pulsations?|Catharine D.|Garmany|Colorado|in September 1983 during a 12-shift VILSPA/NASA program scheduled over six consecutive days we secured over 50 high resolution spectra of HD 50896 (WN5). We have discovered in these data extensive variability in the UV P-Cygni profiles occurring on timescales ~3 hours, with no phase dependence in the purported binary period of 3.7 days and thus found no evidence for the postulated neutron star companion to this star. We believe that this rapid variability in HD 50896 is linked to the occurrence of short period (probably non-radial) pulsations in the star itself and that this phenomenon will be common to WR stars in general. Confirmation of this may well provide the major breakthrough in attempts to understand the extreme mass loss and wind properties of the WR stars. We request a further VILSPA/NASA program in the 8th round, in order to obtain the necessary data for two more WN stars which are accessible to IUE in the HIRES mode with short exposures. Our analysis of the overall data for HD 50896, obtained during 1978-83 shows the occurrence of secular changes (possibly linked to changes in non-radial pulsational modes), and thus a time-sequence of spectra obtained at a single epoch are required.|Y
WRHDB|Ultraviolet Doppler Tomography of the Stellar Wind OF V444 Cygni|Douglas N.|Brown|Washington|We propose to obtain an empirical description of the velocity law, density and ionization structure of the stellar wind of the WN5 component of the eclipsing binary, V444 Cygni. The eclipses of the system will allow inversion of the CastorLamers analytical procedure for synthesis of stellar wind line profiles, ie. Doppler tomography, yielding a direct measurement of the velocity law. Additionally, we propose to determine the ionization structure of the Wolf-Rayet star wind by analysis of the P Cygni profiles of the several UV wind features which arise entirely in the WR star atmosphere.|Y
WRHJE|Line Identifications for the Stratified Extended Atmospheres of Wolf-Rayet Stars|Joel A.|Eaton|Indiana University|High-dispersion IUE spectra of WN and WC stars will be used to determine the excitation and ionization of minor constituents of W-R winds, primarily Fe IV, Fe V, and Fe VI. The identifications of such lines in the winds will be used to determine if excitation is produced primarily by collisions or by radiation. Searches for weaker lines of abundant elements will be conducted to determine the full range of ionization and to see how close to the W-R core each ion exists, information that determines the clumpiness of the wind.|Y
WRICG|A Search for Short-Period Variations in HD 192163 (WN6)|Catharine D.|Garmany|Colorado - JILA|We propose a time-sequence of HIRES SWP observations of the WN6 star HD 192163, considered to be a W-R plus collapsed companion. Optical data of this star, analysed recently by Vreux et al., show periodic variations with P-0.45 day or 0.31 day, strongly indicating a pulsational origin rather than the presence of a companion neutron star. Our complementary IUE studies of HD 50896 and HD 96548 (WN5 and WN8 respectively) secured in previous programs have shown that line profile changes in the UV are larger than seen in the optical. We have also discovered gross WR wind variability in these objects on both the short (t ~1 day) and long (t months) timescales. HD 192163 shows the 'clearest' optical evidence for short-period pulsational activity and its analysis in the UV with IUE will provide a vital component in our attempts to understand WR mass loss and stellar wind variability.|Y
WRIGK|Wind Structures in Magellanic Cloud Wolf-Rayet Stars|Gloria|Koenigsberger|Mexico|We propose to observe Wolf-Rayet + O Star binary systems in the Magellanic Clouds mainly at orbital phases in which the O component undergoes selective atmospheric eclipse by the W-R wind. The varying absorption of the O star spectrum as a functions of impact parameter can be used to derive the optical depth distribution in the winds of the W-R stars. Each system will be observed in the low-dispersion mode during US2 shifts. These observations will be combined with available archival data (by themselves not adequate for our purpose) to achieve adequate phase coverage for the wind structure analysis.  The work being proposed in an extension of the previous WRDLA and WRGLA research by two of us (LA and GK). One of the results of the previous work was the striking similarity in the outer parts of the flows of the five Galactic WN systems then observed. We will search for fundamental differences, if any, between the flows of Galactic and MC W-R stars. The information to be obtained by these new observations is the influence of metallicity on the wind structure.|Y

One of the results of the previous work was the striking similarity in the outer parts of the flows of the five Galactic WN systems then observed. We will search for fundamental differences, if any, between the flows of Galactic and MC W-R stars. The information to be obtained by these new observations is the influence of metallicity on the wind structure. Preliminary results of the observations of HD5980 in SMC (WRIGK program) reveal a major difference in the effects of selective atmospheric eclipses on the wavelength region 1300-1490A with respect to galactic WN's. This is consistent with the lower heavyelement abundances in the SMC.|Y
WRJPC|Wolf-Rayet Stars in the Magellanic Clouds|Peter S.|Conti|Colorado - CASA|We are requesting 5 IUE US1 observing shifts in order to obtain low dispersion short wavelength spectra of 10 faint single WNE stars in the LMC and 2 in the SMC. These data will complete a study of the earliest WN type stars in these two companion galaxies. A comparison and contrast of the spectra of these stars with those known in our galaxy will enable us to discuss the relationship, if any, between the stellar wind spectrum and the parameters of Mv and initial composition. The data newly acquired here will be combined with archival information already existing to provide a significant sample for the analysis. The Magellanic Cloud IUE spectra are needed to obtain information on the strong stellar wind lines existing in the UV. The stars to be analyzed are single, they do not have close companions and they have well determined absolute visual magnitudes and already existing optical spectro-photometry.|Y
WRJSH|Rapid UV Spectral Variability in HD 45166|Sara R.|Heap|NASA/GSFC|We propose to obtain a sequence of time-resolved high resolution IUE spectra of the enigmatic star HD 45166 (quasi-Wolf-Rayet + B8V) in order to investigate relatively rapid variability in its UV P Cygni profiles and qWR emission lines. In our past IUE programmes on this star we have discovered: (1) dramatic variations in its overall spectrum, reflecting changes from an almost pure "qWR emission line phase to strong P Cygni absorption profiles in the UV resonance lines, at different epochs during 1978-86; (2) associated with these large changes in the wind signatures, gross changes also in the qWR highly ionized photospheric absorption spectrum (especially in Fe V), a unique circumstance for a hot star, suggesting strongly that the gross wind changes are caused by the same mechanism altering the photosphere; (3) no changes in the UVoptical continuum energy distribution, the analysis of which has yielded the basic parameters for the qWR component as: Mv = 0.21, Teff = 60000K,  log L/L(sun) = 3.84,  R = 0.77 R, and M =  0.5M(sun),  (4) some evidence secured in 1983 for daily changes to the P Cygni absorption components in C IV 1550A and N V 1240A.  Our observations of HD 45166 in 1986 have confirmed striking changes in the C IV and N V resonance lines on a daily basis, and also significant variability in these lines in two exposures separated by 3 hours. These most recent data have motivated the present application.  We propose to obtain a time sequence of spectra of HD 45166 over a two day period using continuous VILSPA and US shifts, in order to follow the development in time and velocity structure of the qWR wind variability, which may be linked to pulsations of the qWR star. Understanding the variability in HD 45166 may well lead to an improved understanding of similar phenomena in hot, luminous stars.|Y
WRKLA|Wolf-Rayet Stellar Wind Instability: Very Rapid Variability of the Line Spectrum of HD 90657|Lawrence|Auer|Lanl|In our IUE observation of the WN+O6 binary system, HD 90657, changes in the spectrum were detected with a time scale shorter than 90 minutes (Koenigsberger and Auer 1987). The variation requires the existence of significant changes in the small scale structure of the wind. We propose to augment this result by observation of the system at four distinct orbital phases, using absorption of the O-star flux as a direct probe of the small scale wind structure. The data obtained will both give general information on the growth of wind instabilities and determine if they are periodio-an important constraint on their origin. We will also inspect the IUE archives for other evidence of short time scale variations in WR targets.|Y
WRKPC|HD 50896: Origin of its Wind Variability|Peter S.|Conti|Colorado - JILA|We have recently completed an extensive investigation of the UV variability of the WolfRayet star HD 50896 based on IUE data over the interval 1978-1983. We have discovered gross variations in its UV P Cygni profiles, and demonstrated that these are caused by changes intrinsic to the stellar wind, with no evidence for any phase modulated ionization caused by the postulated orbiting neutron star. Our data show the occurrence of rare small scale "quiescent" variability, and more frequent large-scale activity in the wind, reflected in huge changes in the P Cygni profiles with timescales of a day. These variations are among the largest variability effects yet seen in early-type stars. The present data are not sufficient to quantitatively determine the real timescale of the rise and decay of the changes in the wind during the activity phase. It has been shown from studies of stellar wind variability in OB stars that such observations are essential in order to constrain the models. We propose a series of high resolution spectra to provide the necessary time resolution, which we intend to analyse and model using techniques developed for complementary studies of OB stellar wind variability.|Y
WRLLA|The Wind Structure of the SMC Wolf-Rayet Star HD 5980|Lawrence|Auer|Los Alamos|Abstract unavailable|N
WRLPC|Origin of the UV Variability of HD 192163 WN6(+c?)|Peter|Conti|Colorado - CASA|In the 10th IUE round the proposers were allocated VILSPA and NASA time to monitor the WR+neutron star binary candidate HD 192163 over two consecutive days in April 1987. In that programme we secured 24 HIRES IUE SWP spectra in which we have discovered substantial P Cyg absorption profile variability in the excited lines of NIV 1718 and HeII 1640, and smaller-scale changes in the CIV 1550 resonance line. An analysis of these changes shows that the variability could be consistent with alterations to the excitation/ionisation conditions intrinsic to the WN6 stellar wind, or alternatively with binary-related changes to the WN6 wind caused by an orbiting neutron star via the well known Hatchett & McCray effect as seen in massive X-ray binaries. This ambiguity is caused by the fact that within our 1987 data, the observed variability is confined to 'phases' between 0.7 and 0.95 (which is consistent with a Hatchett & McCray effect in an eccentric binary system)Alternatively, the timescale for the observed growth and decay of the profile variability (<= 1 day) is similar to that we have found for other WR stars which more complete phase coverage shows has an intrinsic wind origin. We have also extracted from the IUE archives and analysed all the 21 earlier SWP observations of HD 192163 secured at scattered epochs during 1978-87. These, by chance, embrace 'binaryphases' between 0.2 and 0.6, and do not therefore enable us to test whether the variability we see in our 1987 data (at phi = 0.7-0.95) is repeatable in cycle.  The present application seeks further IUE monitoring of HD 192163 over its full 4.5 day purported binary cycle in order to: (i) determine whether the NIV and HeII variability is really phase dependent and consistent with a Hatchett & McCray effect, or (ii) if not, to determine the true timescale of the intrinsic WN6 wind variability and the recurrence timescale for these changes. If the former is verified, it will provide the first UV evidence for the reality of a proposed WR+neutron star system, of extreme importance is addressing the overall evolutionary scenario of binary WR evolution.|Y
WRLSS|The Colliding Stellar Winds of the Wolf-Rayet Binary Star CQ Cephei|Steven N.|Shore|NM Inst. Tech|We propose to study the structure and dynamics of the stellar wind in the close Wolf-Rayet binary star CQ Cephei. The interaction between the WR and O star winds should differ significantly from that observed in V444 Cyg, and will provide a critical test of the colliding wind model. CQ Cep is unique in being the shortest period WR O binary which can be studied at high dispersion with IUE. An entire orbit can be observed in only a few cycles. Archival data permit the study of long time instabilities at critical orbital phase;. Theoretical hydrodynamic and line profile calculations will be performed for comparison with the ultraviolet observational results.|Y
WRMPC|Wolf-Rayet Stars of WC Type|Peter S.|Conti|Colorado - CASA|The spectra of WC type stars are dominated by emission lines of helium, carbon and oxygen ions, caused by strong stellar winds. Recent improved modeling of these winds, and extensive data concerning the optical and near infra-red (NIR) spectra, indicate that the actual line strengths are reasonably well behaved and can be understood qualitatively in terms of the current theory. It now becomes important to extend the data base to the UV lines which can be observed on IUE, particularly the CIII and CIV ions and the HeII sequences. I have already been involved with the analysis of the similar optical and NIR emission features for nearly all the known Galactic and LMC WC stars. There already exists SWP and LWR(P) IUE data on some of these stars but in a number of cases the existing exposures, while correct for the continuum, were overexposed for the leading emission features.  I am therefore requesting 5US2 IUE observing shifts in order to obtain low dispersion short wavelength spectra of 9 WC stars in our Galaxy for which the previously obtained frames were overexposed in the leading emission lines and for 2 LMC WC stars with underexposed spectra. In addition, I am asking for 2US1 shifts to obtain spectra of another 4 fainter WC stars for which no IUE data exist (this program will pretty much exhaust the list of WC stars that can possibly be observed with this instrument). These spectra will be used to continue a detailed quantitative study of the emission line spectra of WC type stars from the UV through to the near IR. A comparison and contrast of the spectra of the stars in our Galaxy with those of the LMC will enable us to consider the relationship, if any, between the stellar wind spectrum and the model parameters in these objects with differing initial compositions. The IUE data to be newly acquired here will be combined with archival information already existing to provide a significant sample for the analysis.|Y
WRMSS|Coordinated UV and X-Ray Studies of V444 Cygni|Steven N.|Shore|CSC - GHRS|We propose to obtain good phase coverage high dispersion observations of the WR - O eclipsing binary V444 Cygni over a small number of orbits. These observations will be coordinated with ROSAT pointed observations, for which time has already been granted. This program will constrain the colliding winds model. and should detail both the thermal structure and dynamical structure of the interaction region between the two stars. The long temporal baseline available for V444 Cyg will provide a unique chance to study the stability of the wind-wind interaction zone. We will be able to study both the velocity structure of  the shock front and the details of the inner portions of the two stellar winds near their respective photospheres.|Y
WRNAF|UV Observations of Wolf-Rayet Stars in NGC 4214|Alexei V.|Filippenko|UC Berkeley|Using optical spectra, we have discovered strong emission lines attributed to Wolf-Rayet stars in several bright H II regions in the nearby Magellanic irregular galaxy NGC 4214. In addition to WN stars, WC stars are present. This is the first galaxy outside the Local Group in which WC stars have definitely been detected. Broad H-alpha emission, probably produced by late WN stars, is also visible in the brightest H II region of NGC 4214. Very steep spatial gradients in the intensities of the Wolf-Rayet lines are observed. These may be indicative of variations in the initial mass function at different locations of NGC 4214. We propose to obtain SWP and LWP spectra of the central bar of NGC 4214, which contains several bright H II regions, in order to further explore the properties of the Wolf-Rayet stars in this galaxy. Several spatially distinct regions, with widely different equivalent widths of optical Wolf-Rayet lines, will be sampled by the large IUE aperture. By using newly developed extraction techniques, we will be able to isolate the spectra of these H II regions, and systematically study differences in their stellar populations.|Y
WRNLA|The Wind Structure of HD 5980|Lawrence|Auer|Los Alamos National Labs.|We propose to observe the Wolf-Rayet + O star binary system HD 5980, the brightest WR in the Small Magellanic Cloud, at orbital phases in which the O component undergoes eclipse by the WR wind. Our previous observations show strong variations occur in the lines of N IV 1718, C IV and He II and N V. Profile variations am consistent with the wind eclipse interpretation. Additional high dispersion data are now necessary in order to obtain sufficient orbital phase coverage to deduce the wind velocity and opacity laws by detailed modeling of the profile variations. The same modeling techniques will be applied to archival high resolution data of V444 Cyg, a Galactic counterpart of HD 5980, so as to determine the role that the heavy metal abundances play in the wind structure.  Our previous IUE research on HD 5890, under WRLLA, has shown a major difference between it and Galactic WR+O binary systems is the absence of a detectable Fe V and Fe VI pseudo-continuum, which is consistent with lower metal abundances. If radiation pressure is the driving mechanism for the wind, the detailed wind structure should likewise differ, as appears to be the case from our preliminary results. The data already suggest that the physical acceleration zone in HD 5980 is not as extended as in V444 Cyg, but additional phase coverage is needed in order to perform a more detailed analysis of the wind structure.|Y
WRNPC|Spectral Synthesis of Wolf-Rayet Galaxies|Peter S.|Conti|Colorado - CASA|Emission-line O-galaxies are those whose spectra results primarily from the presence of a large number of O-type stars. Wolf-Rayet galaxies are a subset of emission-line galaxies in which there is evidence for the existence of 10^2 to 10^5 Wolf-Rayet stars. We are engaged in an extensive observational and theoretical study of Wolf-Rayet galaxies. Ultraviolet data are essential to this study as they provide constraints on the hot star populations in these objects. Therefore, we are requesting six IUE US1 observing shifts to obtain low dispersion ultraviolet spectra of five Wolf-Rayet galaxies and one emissionline galaxy; we would like to obtain data over the entire wavelength range accessible to IUE. These data will complement previously acquired optical spectra and will be analyzed using spectral synthesis models we are developing. By modeling the ultraviolet and optical spectra of these galaxies we hope to determine their properties and distinguishing characteristics, deduce their stellar populations and initial mass functions, and derive information about their evolutionary history.|Y
WROLA|Variability of the Discrete Absorption Components in the Wolf-Rayet Star HD 193077|Lawrence|Auer|Los Alamos National Labs.|HD 193077 is the only well-docurnented example of a Wolf-Rayet star in which narrow absorption components are consistently present at close to terminal speed (in the unsaturated resonance lines of both Si IV and C IV). We propose to obtain high- dispersion time series spectroscopy of this object in order to investigate, for the first time, the temporal evolution of discrete components in a WR star. These observations will show if the behaviour of the discrete components matches that seen in OB stars, and, therefore, indicates that the dynamics of WR winds at intermediate velocities are controlled by lineradiation pressure as they are in OB winds. Moreover, photospheric absorption lines indicate a projected rotation velocity of ve sin(i) ~500 km/s for HD 193077, very close to break-up, so this star also offers a unique opportunity to investigate the correlation between very large ve sin(i) and DAC development.|Y
WRRGK|The Changing Wind Structure in the SMC Wolf-Rayet|Gloria K.|Koenigsberger|UNAM|The Wolf-Rayet system HD5980 is a unique system in which an unusual mass-shedding event is in progress. Between 1979 and 1991 we have observed a transition in this SMC system characterized by: a brightening in the visual by 0.45 mag and in the UV by 0.13 mag; a factor of 2 to 10 increase in equivalent width of emission lines; the appearance in 1986 of N IV] 1486, absent in 1981: a decrease by 600 km/s in wind terminal speed; and a change in WR spectral type from WN3 (in the late 1970's) to WN6 (late 1980's) and perhaps even WN7 (early 1990's). This transition in HD5980 is unprecedented and its cause is unexplained at the moment. However, it is clear that one of the winds in the system has become more dense and slower. The primary objective of the four new IUE observations we seek and the subsequent analyses is to determine the mechanism responsible for the changes in the wind structure, as well as an estimate of the wind velocity structure during its evolution. The system is being monitored from ground-based observatories.|Y

WUKEG|Global Mapping of the Photosphere, Chromosphere, and Transition-Regions of VW Cephei|Edward F.|Guinan|Villanova|During April 1987, we were granted one discretionary shift with IUE to study the chromospheric and transition regions of VW Cep. During one complete orbital cycle 3 SWP and 4 LWP low dispersion spectra were obtained including and then excluding the suspected active region. The location of the spotted region was inferred from contemporaneous ground-based photometry. For the first time, phase dependent TR line emission strengths were found, most notably C IV, which was 50% stronger when the spot region was most visible. There was a 20% variation in the level of Mg II emission but this may be due to an eclipse effect. Unfortunately, the number of spectra and their phase distribution are insufficient to determine with confidence the association of the line emissions with the active regions defined by the starspots.  We are proposing to observe VW Cep with IUE over two consecutive shifts so that a more detailed mapping of the surface activity may be achieved. Light curves obtained during 1987 reveal that the spot regions have grown since April, thus making this a great opportunity to study aW UMa-system in a very active state. VW Cep represents an extreme case for studying stellar dynamo theory and the proposed IUE observations can play a crucial role in the understanding of magnetic fields and activity cycles in rapidly rotating solar-like stars.|Y
WVQDM|Wind Variability in Hot, Massive Stars: The Rotation Connection|Derck|Massa|Applied Research Corporation|We are requesting 23 continuous days of IUE time to obtain time series observations of an O star, a B supergiant, and a WR star. This large, collaborative proposal was born at the international Workshop on Instability and Variability of Hot-Star Winds (Isle-aux-Coudres, Quebec, 1993 August 23-27). Speaker after speaker noted that, despite impressive progress in defining the phenomenology of the UV wind line variability detected by IUE in OB and WR stars, none of the existing time series is long enough to sample the rich patterns of variability adequately. In particular, although tantalizing hints of a direct connection between wind variability and stellar rotation have emerged, a causal connection has not yet been established. By consensus, the Workshop identified a continuous time series, long enough to sample the stellar rotation period, as the single outstanding piece of observational evidence needed to gain deeper insights into the physical processes responsible for the wind variations. Only IUE observations can address this crucial issue in the foreseeable future, and it would be a tragedy to lose the opportunity to obtain the observational material which is needed to make genuine progress in this field. The team of investigators has agreed to wave all proprietary data rights and to refrain from proposing separate monitoring programs of this nature. As a result, we emphasize that the community of astronomers studying the variability of hot star winds is not requesting more telescope time than it would during a normal episode. Instead, we are simply requesting that the time we would normally seek be allocated in a single, continuous block, so that we can address the most outstanding observational problem in our field while our primary observational facility is still available.|Y

WWOES|Do DA Stars Have Weak Winds?|Edward M.|Sion|Villanova University|Five existing high-resolution SWP images of G191-B2B have been used to identify Fe V lines (Tweedy 1991) whose excitation potentials require an origin in the hot photosphere. Remarkably however, there is a significant absorption line velocity difference in G191-B2B, among highly ionized species, with the C IV and N V absorption lines being blue-shifted relative to the Fe V lines by - 10 km/s. This difference could be due to the beginning of weak wind outflow/circumstellar expansion, and if confirmed, would have profound implications for the discrepancy between the ultra-thin H layers of DA white dwarfs required by pulsation theory and the thicker H-layers of DA stars predicted by stellar evolution calculations. However, the previous IUE echelle observations of G191B2B lack the strictly controlled conditions that are necessary to account for the errors properly, which is critical for confirming the reality of the velocity shift apparent in the data. Firm detection of a weak wind in G191-B2B can potentially solve the problem of the thickness of hydrogen layers in white dwarfs, and at the same time will directly answer where the high-ionisation lines are formed. We propose a strictly controlled IUE experiment, requiring two consecutive low background shifts (US1 + low background European2) that will yield the precision needed to resolve the issue of a weak wind in G191-B2B. Our results should resolve the ambiguity underscored by Vennes el aL (1991) concerning the formation of lines in the photosphere versus line formation in slowly expanding circumstellar shells.|Y

XBBGF|A Comparative Study of the UV and X-Ray Line Spectra of Four Binary X-Ray Sources|Guiseppina|Fabbiano|Harvard CFA - SAO|We propose IUE observations of four optically identified galactic X-ray sources: Cyg X-2, AM Her, SS Cyg, U Gem.  In the coming year, we are going to observe these sources with HEAO-B. We expect to measure soft X-ray spectra and will be able to detect X-ray emission lines with high resolution. We want to compare the soft X-ray and UV spectra with particular attention to line emission. This will determine ionization states, temperature(s), and abundances. The combination of UV and X-ray data will span a particularly broad range of temperature and will be most valuable in determining the nature of these objects.|Y
XBBHG|Strong Binary X-Ray Stars|Herbert|Gursky|Smithsonian|A program of observing binary x-ray stars is proposed for 1979 that will continue work begun in 1978. The primary objects are Cygnus X-1, Sco X-1, Her X-1, 301700-37, Vela X-1, and SMC X-1. All are powerful x-ray sources. In addition, we will obtain a small number of observations of weak x-ray sources that may be of this same class. We have already found that two objects Cyg X-1 and Her X-1 show significant spectral variability with orbital phase.  The observations described here provide for complete phase coverage and duplication where appropriate in order to separate binary effects from other variability for at least certain of these objects. We also will attempt to obtain simultaneous x-ray and visual spectral data on selected objects. This kind of data base is required in order to determine characteristics unique to the x-ray sources. Furthermore, the data will provide an essential starting point for investigations of other x-ray sources.|Y
XBCHG|Observations of Strong Binary X-Ray Stars with IUE|Herbert|Gursky|CFA|We propose to obtain short wavelength spectra at high dispersion of the brightest low-mass binary X-ray source (Sco X-1) to obtain velocity information vital to our understanding of the source of the N V and C IV emission, and of the brightest Magellanic-cloud binary X-ray sources (LMC X4 and SMC X-I) to probe the character of the stellar winds that presumably give rise to the X-ray luminosities, which are larger than comparable galactic sources. We will also study the Magellanic Cloud sources at low dispersion to obtain additional information concerning their variability with orbital phase, and Cyg X-2 at short and long-wavelength low dispersion, to investigate in particular the differences between it and Sco X-1. We also propose to obtain short wavelength spectra at high dispersion of Vela X-1 simultaneously with X-ray observations for detailed studies of this bright Xray binary.|Y
XBCJM|Cygnus X-2 Neutron Star or Degenerate Dwarf?|J. E.|McClintock|MIT|We propose to measure the strength of the 2200 A interstellar absorption feature in the spectrum on Cygnus X-2 using IUE in order to distinguish between two competing models for the system: (1) The established neutron star model, which has recently gained strong additional support from the discoveries by Cowley et al. (1979) of a 9.84 day orbital period for the system and a largeamplitude radial velocity curve for the optical star. These spectroscopic data, plus the standard Roche model of X-ray binary systems, strongly imply that the optical companion is an early F giant or subgiant at a distance of about 8 kpc. (2) Arrival model put forward by Branduardi et al. (1979), in which the compact object is a degenerate dwarf. Their work, which contains a remarkable example of congruence between theory and observation, predicts a well defined distance to Cyg X-2 of 250  50 pc.  The line of sight in the direction of Cyg X-2 (b^II = -11 degrees) leaves the galactic plane at a distance of about 500 pc, and the reddening to this distance and to infinity is E(B-V) - 0.2 mag nitudes. We propose to observe Cyg X-2 during two low-background, 8-hour shifts, and to observe in both the short wavelength (SWP) and long wavelength (LWR) passbands, with emphasis on the latter.  The UV spectrum will be evaluated along with high quality optical reddening data in order to determine if Cyg X-2 lies within the galactic dust layer or beyond, thereby ruling for or against the degenerate dwarf model.|Y
XBDTK|IUE Observations of X-Ray Binaries: High Resolution Observation of SMC X-1|Timothy R.|Kallman|MIT|We propose to study the effects of X-ray ionization of the winds from early-type stars in X-ray binary systems. In these systems, X-ray ionization is observable as a variation in ultraviolet P-Cygni line profiles with orbital phase. This effect has been observed at high resolution in the Vela X-1 system, and at low resolution in the systems SMC X-1 and LMC X-4. The observations requested in this proposal would observe SMC X-1 at high resolution at two different orbital phases. Observed line profiles, together with the profiles from Vela X-1, would provide an important test of current theory for ionization in earlytype X-ray binaries.|Y
XBECB|An Attempt to Discover the Nature of Mass Transfer in Massive X-Ray Binaries|C. Stuart|Bowyer|UC Berkeley|"Hard" (kT > 15 KeV) X-ray transient outbursts have long been attributed to increases in the mass loss rate or shell ejection by BeCompanions to neutron stars in binary systems. Until recently, however, all the attempts to discover such effects have been unsuccessful. This is most likely due to the fact that the optical (and some IUE) observations have typically been performed after the increased X-ray intensity is reported. A similar observational situation has also applied to the X-ray "high states" from the black hole candidate Cyg X-1. It now appears, from recent observations of 4U0115+63, that the optical indications of mass loss precede the X-ray flares by ~ months, and the delay between the optical and X-ray outbursts has severely constrained the allowable mechanisms for mass transfer in this system. We will be routinely observing four additional X-ray Be systems as well as HDE 226868 (Cyg X-1), at the Lick and Leuschner observatories, in an attempt to discover more clues to the nature of the mass loss. The optical observations will be used to alert both the IUE and the existing X-ray satellites to any dramatic changes in either intensity or line profiles which may signify increased mass loss. It is important to study these stars from the time of the initial optical outbursts through the subsequent X-ray flares which are expected two-three months later. We hope to be able to coordinate the IUE observations with X-ray coverage by either the Ariel VI or Hakucho satellites (barring re-entry or sun angle constraints). The IUE observations are an essential part of the program to study the fundamental nature of mass transfer in these systems.|Y
XBFJR|High Dispersion Study of HZ Herculis|John C.|Raymond|Harvard CFA - SAO|No detailed interpretation of the striking C IV and N V emission lines In low mass Xray binaries such as HZ Her or Sco X-1 has yet been attempted. Part of the difficulty Is that the lines could be emitted from the outer accretion disk, from a corona above the disk, from an accretion stream, or from the Illuminated face of the cool companIon. High dispersion profiles of the emission lines provide the central velocity and the velocity width of the emission, thereby determining the location of the emitting region within the system. High resolution exposures also provide the doublet ratio, a necessary Indication of whether the line emission Is effectively optically thin or optically thick. Howarth and Wilson have Interpreted an N V profile of HZ Her as optically thin emission from a blob on the edge of the accretion disk. This Interpretation Is somewhat difficult to reconcile with an N V profile which we have obtained. The proposed observations will resolve this uncertainty.|Y
XBGJH|Phase Resolved Spectra of LMC X-1|John B.|Hutchings|DAO|LMC X-1 is a 4-day binary containing a black hole candidate. IUE spectra are needed to study phase modulation of wind lines, and continuum intensity in order to (a) set mass constraints and (b) observe possible UV flux from accreting object or its disk.|Y
XBGJJ|Selected X-Ray Binaries at X-Ray Outbursts or High States|Jun|Jugaku|Tokyo|We propose a study of the ultraviolet spectrophotometry of selected X-ray binaries during X-ray outbursts and of Cyg X-1 at its X-ray high states. Lowdispersion IUE spectra, which are obtained quasi-simultaneously with X-ray data, should enable an indepth study of the physical properties of :he accretion disks in low-mass binaries and, in the case of Cyg X-1, the structure of the ionized regions around the optically visible primary. We wish to note that in addition to the three targets given on the target specification form, any-new soft X-ray transient sources detected during the 7th year will be observed on this program. However, we anticipate that only one such a target is likely to be found in a state suitable for simultaneous observation.|Y
XBGJR|Spectral Variations in AM Her Stars|John C.|Raymond|Harvard CFA - SAO|UV spectra of AM Her show a hot blackbody component which is eclipsed in phase with the hard and soft X-ray eclipses. A recent determination of the blackbody temperature of the soft component of AM Her shows that the RayleighJeans tail detected in the UV is not the long wavelength end of the same blackbody seen in soft X-rays. We wish to obtain phase resolved spectra of several newly discovered AM Her systems whose light curves suggest clean eclipses in order to search for similar Rayleigh-Jeans components.|Y
XBHGR|IUE Ultraviolet Observations of the Am Hercules-Like X-Ray Binary HO139-68|Guenter A.|Riegler|JPL|We propose to study the ultraviolet continuum and resonant emission lines in the 1200-3200 A band from a newly discovered AM Hercules-like Xray emitting binary H0139-68 discovered by us (Agrawal et al, 1981, 1983). The optical and X-ray characteristics suggest that H0139-68 contains a magnetic white dwarf and the observed soft X-ray flux originates in the accretion column above the magnetic poles of the star. The soft X-ray spectrum is best described as a black body emission with kT < 40 eV (Agrawal et al, 1983). The proposed observations with IUE are aimed at the study of (I) Ultraviolet continuum to determine whether this is a Rayleigh-Jeans end of the same black body which produces the soft X-ray flux; (II) to search for any strong UV flux due to cyclotron emission predicted in the model of Lamb and Master (1979); (111) study variability of the continuum with an orbital phase, and (IV) to detect emission lines due to O I, C II, Mg II, He II, C III, Si III, C IV, Si IV, and N V and measure their intensities and variability. These objectives will be achieved by taking low dispersion spectra of the object with SWP and LWR cameras.|Y
XBHJJ|Target-of-Opportunity Observations of Selected X-Ray Binaries at X-Ray Outbursts|Jun|Jugaku|Japen|We propose a study of the ultraviolet spectrophotometry of selected X-ray binaries-during X-ray outbursts. Low-dispersion IUE spectra, which are obtained quasi-simultaneously with X-ray data, should enable an indepth study of the physical properties of the accretion disks in low-mass binaries. We wish to note that in addition to the two targets given on the target specification form, any new soft X-ray transient sources detected during the 8th year will be observed on this program. However, we anticipate that only one such a target is likely to be found in a state suitable for simultaneous observation.|Y
XBHJR|High Dispersion Study of HZ Herculis|John C.|Raymond|Harvard CFA - SAO|The aim of the proposed research is to resolve the uncertainty over the site of the emission region in the HZ Her system (Margon and Cohen 1978; Howarth and Wilson 1983b). We plan to do this by comparing the predicted velocity and the X-ray dip timing characteristics of the Howarth and Wilson 'blob' model with high resolution spectroscopy of the N V resonance lines and supporting EXOSAT observations of the Xray intensity. This work therefore builds on the set of high resolution observations we obtained a year ago. Unfortunately, at the time those data were obtained the observed (though not apparently the intrinsic) Xray flux from the system fell to a lower level than had ever been observed previously. As a result, complementary EXOSAT data obtained by the MPI group have been of little use. Now that the system has regained its usual X-ray intensity we propose repeating the observations in the belief that a decisive result will be forthcoming.|Y
XBHTK|Simultaneous Ultraviolet and X-Ray Observations of Two Massiive X-Ray Binaries|Timothy R.|Kallman|NASA/GSFC|We propose to observe HD153919, the optical counterpart of the x-ray source 4U1700-37, in order to gain a better understanding of the strong stellar wind from this star and its interaction with the x-ray source. In order to study the combined effects of variability in both the wind and the x-ray source we intend to make these observations with simultaneous EXOSAT coverage. This proposal is part of a larger project aimed at obtaining simultaneous x-ray and ultraviolet data with full orbital phase coverage for as many of the x-ray binaries with early-type primaries as possible. These combined data will allow several insights into the nature of the primary's stellar wind. First, we intend to investigate long-term variability in the stellar wind and its correlation with the intrinsic x-ray luminosity of the secondary. Second, we will undertake a detailed study of resonance line profile changes with orbital phase (the 'Hatchett-McCray' effect). Third, we will pay particular attention to changes in the ionization structure on short (<1 hr.) timescales, related to the intense (factor 5-10) x-ray flares known to occur in this system. HD153919/4UI700-37 is unique among the x-ray binaries and so is ideally suited for studies of variations on these timescales, owing to its high wind mass loss rate.|Y
XBIJL|Observations of Longer Period, X-Ray Selected, RS CVN Systems|Jeffery L.|Linsky|Colorado|We propose to obtain SWP-LO and LWP-LO spectra for all longer-period (p> 2 days) RS CVn systems brighter than mv=9 for which there exist previous X ray observations. This well-selected sample is required to obtain the correlations between chromospheric, transition region and coronal fluxes. These correlations, along with their dependence on spectral type and rotation period, constrain the models of the outer atmospheres of RS CVn's. In conjunction with archived data on the shorter period systems, the new observations of the longer-period systems will provide a database that is large enough to sort out the often-competing effects due to spectral type and rotation period.|Y
XBJJH|Simultaneous Observations of AM HER|Jay B.|Holberg|Arizona|We propose to obtain IUE observations of the magnetic cataclysmic variable AN Her in its "high" state. These observations are intended as part of a coordinated program of simultaneous observations of this system with Voyager in the 500 to 1200A range together with optical/infrared photometry and spectropolarimetry. The primary scientific objectives of our proposal are: 1) To critically test model predictions for the energy distribution of the reprocessed soft X-ray "blackbody" component , 2) To determine the existence of the short wavelength "upturn" seen in some SWP spectra and any possible relation it may have to the soft X-ray blackbody component, and 3) To determine the apparent luminosity of the AX Her "high" state by incorporating nearlysimultaneous observations from 500A to the visible.|Y
XBJRM|Pulse-Phase Spectroscopy of the X-Ray Binary 4U0900-40/HD77581|Richard A.|McCray|Colorado - CASA|We propose to observe HD77581, the optical counterpart of the X-ray binary 4UO900-40, in order to study the effects of X-ray ionization on the stellar wind. Changes with X-ray orbital phase of the Si IV 1398, C IV 1550, and N V 1240 P-Cygni line profiles are well known in this system. The goals of this observing program are to search for expected variability of the line profiles with the 283s X-ray pulse period and to compare the observations with theoretical models in order to understand better the geometry of the X-ray beam and the density/velocity structure of the stellar wind. Time resolved high resolution observations will be made by "strobing" the detector high voltage synchronously with the X-ray pulse period.|Y
XBKJB|Multi-Wavelength Studies of AE Aqr|Jay A.|Bookbinder|Colorado - JILA|We propose to obtain the first simultaneous ultraviolet and radio observations of the DQ Herculis type system AE Aquarii using the IUE and the VLA. AE Aqr is unique in that it is the only DQ Her system (and only one of two magnetic cataclysmic variables) that emits detectable levels of radio emission. Previous nonsimultaneous ultraviolet, optical, and radio observations of AE Aqr show a large degree of variability on timescales significantly shorter than the orbital period of 9.9 hours. We wish to determine whether the ultraviolet and radio emitting regions are causally related by studying the correlation of the variability in these two wavelength regimes. The radio observations will be obtained at five frequencies, and will be binned in time to match the IUE exposures. The variability of the six independent data sets will studied using cross correlation techniques. In addition, the radio variability on timescales as short as 3.3 seconds can be studied with the VLA.  While it is clear that the high temperature ultraviolet emission lines originate in or near the accretion disk, as evidenced by their relationship to the x-ray emission, two competing models have been proposed to account for the observed radio emission. The radio emission could arise from either synchrotron emission from multiple flares initiated near the rapidly rotating magnetized white dwarf or it may be the result of quasisteady gyrosynchrotron emission near the companion K dwarf. Simultaneous observations will enable us to distinguish between these competing models of this unique object and will permit a better analysis of the physical processes occuring in this system. A US1 shift followed by the first half of a US2 shift will provide the complete orbital phase coverage needed for this project.|Y
XBKJH|Simultaneous Studies of Two W UMa Systems in the UV and X-Ray|Jay B.|Holberg|Arizona|Simultaneous observations of two W UMa systems involving IUE and GINGA are proposed. These observations are intended to study the relationship between the transition regions and coronae of 44i Boo and VW Cep with simultaneous coverage in the UV and the 1 to 30 keV X-ray band. Monitoring of both systems will extend over several 8 hr. orbital periods in order to unambiguously separate orbital modulations from transient events. These observations will permit the study of both types of variability over a range of plasma temperatures and contribute to our understanding of coronal heating.|Y
XBKSV|Multiwavelength Studies of Cygnus X-2|Saeqa Dil|Vrtilek|NASA/GSFC|We propose to address an outstanding problem in the study of low mass X-ray binaries (LMXRBs) by taking part in an international, multiwavelength campaign to intensively observe one of these systems, Cyg X-2. Appropriate ground and space based observatories in wavelength bands from X-ray through radio will be used to conduct this study. Cyg X-2 is a highly variable system, which is of particular interest because it shows at least 3 distinct spectral modes in X-rays that appear to be related to different modes of the recently discovered quasi-periodic oscillations (QP0s) found in these systems. No explanation has as yet been found for either the spectral behavior or the QPO activity and an important open question concerns the relation of the mass accretion rate to the different spectral modes. In order to address this question properly one needs to know the fluctuations in bolometric (from radio to X-ray energies) output from this system, which are presumably attributable to changes in the accretion rate; in short, simultaneous multiwavelength observations in as many wavelength bands as possible are needed. These observations are envisioned as one of the most complete sets of simultaneous observations of a LMXRB ever made, and should be extremely valuable in elucidating the nature of accretion in these objects.|Y
XBLCS|X-Ray Transients as Targets of Opportunity|Chris R.|Shrader|CSC|I propose to observe newly discovered transient X-ray sources as targets of opportunity with IUE. The so called "Soft X-ray Transients" (SXTs) such as Cen X-4 and A0620-00 have outburst xray luminosities 102-106 times greater than in quiescence and corresponding increases of up to 6 or 7 in mB. They often remain in outburst for tens of days in X-rays, and Slightly longer in blue-UV wavelengths. The blue-UV emission is believed to be reprocessed X-rays from material in an accretion disk or the face of the secondary. This class of objects is at present poorly studied in the ultraviolet, a region which is of fundamental importance in testing current modeling scenarios. Ultraviolet data may also provide insight regarding the structure of the inner accretion disk and perhaps the instabilities leading to outburst.|Y
XBLSV|Multiwavelength Observations of Scorpius X-1|Saeqa Dil|Vrtilek|Harvard CFA - SAO|We propose to obtain simultaneous observations of the low mass X-ray binary source (LMXRB) Sco X-1 with IUE and the Japanese X-ray satellite GINGA. Simultaneous UV/X-ray observations of Sco X-1 are now particularly important in the context of results obtained during recent multiwavelength observations of Cyg X-2. LMXRBs show three X-ray spectral states which form a "Z-shaped" curve in an X-ray color-color diagram. The simultaneous IUE/GINGA observations of the LMXRB Cyg X2 made in June and October of 1988 show that there is a direct correlation between the strength of the UV continuum and line emission and the placement of the X-ray spectrum in one of the three branches of the "Z". This relationship favors the interpretation of Lamb (1987) that mass-accretion increases monotonically along the branches of the "Z" in the order horizontal branch (HB), normal branch (NB), and flaring branch (FB). The relationship between X-ray spectral states and mass accretion rate is a key question in the study of LMXRBs and it is crucial to see if this result holds for other LMXRBs. Sco X-1 and Cyg X-2 are the only LMXRBs that show all three branches of the X-ray spectral states and corresponding QPO states clearly. Previous coordinated IUE/X-ray observations of Sco X-1 involved X-ray data obtained with the Copernicus satellite, which did not have the necessary spectral and temporal resolution to resolve the three states or to detect the QPOs. No simultaneous observations were made with EXOSAT and IUE. If the result obtained for Cyg X-2 continues to hold for Sco X-1, the proposed observations may help us establish that the mass-accretion rate does indeed increase monotonically along the "Z" in the X-ray color-color diagram providing an important clue in understanding the nature of LMXRB.|Y
XBMCS|X-Ray Transients as Targets of Opportunity|Christopher R.|Shrader|CSC - IUE Observatory|I propose to observe newly discovered transient X-ray sources as targets of opportunity with IUE. The so called "Soft X-ray Transients" (SXTs) such as Cen X-4 and A0620-00 have outburst x-ray luminosities 102-106 times greater than in quiescence and corresponding increases of up to 6 or 7 in mB. They often remain in outburst for tens of days in X-rays, and slightly longer in blue-UV wavelengths. The blue-UV emission is believed to be reprocessed Xrays from material in an accretion disk or he face of the secondary. The Be star transients can also exhibit remarkable energetics, and can remain in outburst for days to weeks. These high energy transients are at present poorly studied in the ultraviolet, a region which is of fundamental importance in testing current modeling scenarios. Ultraviolet data may also provide Insight regarding the structure of the inner accretion disk and thus into the instabilities leading to outburst.|Y
XBMGP|Wind and Fuv Flux Variability in X-Ray Emitting Be Stars|Geraldine J.|Peters|USC|Monthly IUE observations of classical Be stars which were detected as X-ray sources in the Uhuru database are proposed to explore the possibility that the X-rays are associated with the presence of very high velocity (<-800 km s^-1) narrow components (VHVNC) in the wind lines and investigate the cause for variability observed in their FUV flux and winds. A correlation between X-ray emission and VHVNCs would suggest a common line formation region for both. Presently there is circumstantial evidence for this as many of the Uhuru sources have shown transient narrow components with expansion velocities in excess of 1000 km s^-1. Both X-ray emission and VHVNCs are rarely observed in the general population of classical Be stars. As the Uhuru Be stars are likely to be detected in the ROSAT all sky survey, IUE coverage will allow us to answer the question about the possible X-rayVHVNC connection. Voyager UVS and IUE observations have revealed that the FUV flux (900-1200 A) and winds vary in most of the X-ray emitting Be stars. The VHVNC in the wind tend to be transient. I propose IUE and Voyager observations of these objects before and after the ROSAT coverage to investigate the pre- and posthistory of the wind and continuum activity. This will allow us to assess whether the X-ray generation is a function of earlier/later high energy events in the wind/photosphere, even if VHVNCs are not observed contemporaneously with the Xrays. Program stars include gamma Cas, 48 Per, HR 4009, kappa Dra, pi Aqr (all of which were detected in the Uhuru database and lambda Eri, 66 Oph, and 59 Cyg, which were not found to be hard X-ray sources but frequently show VHVNCs.|Y
XBMJR|The Eclipsing Intermediate Polar LB1800|John C.|Raymond|Harvard SAO - CFA|LB1800 is a recently discovered cataclysmic variable which has been identified with the hard X-ray transient 4U0608-49. It shows deep eclipses and high excitation (strong He II) in the optical. Both the strong hard X-rays and the He II emission suggest that the object is an intermediate polar, though this has not yet been demonstrated conclusively. Its brightness (13th magnitude) and long period (5.6 hours) make it an ideal candidate for detailed study of the accretion disk structure and emission line regions. If, as we expect, it does turn out to be a magnetic system, we will test theories we are developing for the influence of a stellar magnetic field on the temperature structure of an accretion disk, as well as models for the X-ray photoionized regions responsible for the emission lines. If it turns out to be a non-magnetic nova-like variable, its eclipses will provide an excellent test of models of cataclysmic variable winds. We request time for a simultaneous UV-optical study of three orbital cycles.|Y
XBNAC|Long-Term Variations of the Black-Hole Binary LMC X-3|Anne P.|Cowley|Arizona State University|Recent analysis of X-ray data from HEAO-1 and Ginga shows that the X-ray luminosity of the black-hole binary LMC X-3, long known to be highly variable, is modulated with either a double-peaked ~200-day period or a single-peaked ~100-day period. Because the variation is so regular, it seems likely that the periodicity is related to some "clock" in the system, such as a precessing accretion disk similar to those in Her X-1 or SS433. From the X-ray data alone, it is not clear what the most appropriate physical model for this variability is. Selected ultraviolet observations at certain phases in the long-term cycle may allow us to discriminate been various models of the accretion disk. Seven short-wavelength archival spectra are available, but because LMC X-3 varies throughout the 1.7-day orbital cycle, the existing data are insufficient to separate these two very different variations (orbital and long-term). We wish to obtain IUE spectra at selected long-period phases, but always observing at the same orbital phase. This will allow us to study the long-term variations without interference from the orbital changes.|Y
XBNSK|IUE Observations of the X-Ray Binary HD 154791|Scott J.|Kenyon|Harvard CFA - SAO|We propose to obtain UV spectra of the X-ray binary HD 154791. The low resolution spectra of this program will yield a good "snapshot" of disk formation in a wide binary system: the emission lines are good density diagnostics, while the UV continuum is a good probe of the luminosity and optical depth. Our planned high resolution exposure will provide a good estimate of the wind velocity - if the line is narrow and formed in the red giant's wind - or the structure of the outer disk if the line is wide.|Y

XBQPS|Phase-Resolved UV Spectra of the Accretion Disk in 2S 0921-630|Paul|Schmidtke|Arizona State University|During the 15th IUE episode we obtained an exploratory SWP spectrum of the long period low-mass Xray binary 2S0921-630 to demonstrate that this source is, indeed, within the useful sensitivity of the satellite. Taken near the time of optical eclipse, the spectrum shows strong emission lines of CIV and HeII superposed on a weak UV continuum. In the proposed study we will obtain SWP images of 2S0921-630 at other orbital phases to measure changes in the disk temperature and to search for variations of the line-emitting region.|Y
XCILC|UV Emission Lines Studies of Gas in the Cores of X-Ray Luminous Clusters|Lennox L.|Cowie|STScI|Optical narrow band imaging and spectroscopy of the central regions of a number of rich homogeneous clusters have now revealed twelve cases in which spatially extended low ionization emission line systems are seen. (These are probably produced by cooling of the X-ray emitting atmosphere in the cluster.) Line ratios indicate temperatures of 10^4 K and densities of 10^2 - 10^3 cm^-3. H-alpha luminosities lie in the 10^41 ergs/s range. Over the last year and a half our narrow band imaging programmes at the Kitt Peak 4 metre and the Hawaii 88" telescope on Mauna Kea have provided accurate H-alpha luminosities for almost all the known systems. (Further time at the 88" is available in the upcoming year to complete the list) The H-alpha luminosities may be used in conjunction with L-alpha measurements to estimate the intrinsic reddening caused by dust in the cluster gas. Gas column densities can be obtained from the X-ray data and the dust to gas ratios can then be used to test thermal sputtering models for the dust. The extinction measurements may also be combined with X-ray measurements of the hot gas density and temperature to predict infrared luminosities (e.g. Hu, Cowie, and Wang, 1985). These can then be compared with the pointed IRAS measurements to test the consistency of the models. Five of the twelve clusters have such IRAS data (as yet unanalyzed) which we will shortly obtain at public release. Adequate IUE observations already exist for five of the clusters (Perseus, A1795, A2052, A2199, and A496). We propose to obtain the corresponding IUE data for the remaining members of the set which we will combine with the existing data to perform a complete analysis.|Y
XCJJR|The X-Ray Source in ML5|John C.|Raymond|Harvard CFA - SAO|In the first year of IUE, we attempted to observe the X-ray source at the center of the globular cluster M15, but the emission from the X-ray source was buried by the emission of numerous horizontal branch stars. Recently, Charles et al. (1986) have identified the optical counterpart of the X-ray source. Knowing its precise location, they were able to locate the line where it should appear in the lineby-line data file from our spectrum. They found strong He II 1640 emission in that line, confirming the identification. They also found a 9.1 hour orbital period, and we wish to look for orbital variations in back to back ESA - NASA shifts.|Y

XGBYK|UV Observations of X-Ray Galaxies|Yoji|Kondo|NASA/GSFC|We propose to investigate, through simultaneous observations with IUE and HEAO satellites, two classes of X-ray emitting galaxies in order to understand the physical mechanism involved. The two types of X-ray emitting galaxies to be studied are BL Lac objects and emission-line galaxies. Both of these type objects have been identified as X-ray emitters only within the last several months and are currently being investigated actively. Consequently, the amount of information on them is quite sparse.  Ultraviolet observations are critically in need because: first, the UV continua are likely to reflect more closely any variation in the X-ray flux; second, ultraviolet emission lines that are excited by soft X-ray photons should reflect the decrease or increase of X-ray photons; third, UV observations will fill the important gap between the X-ray and visual spectral regions. The physical mechanisms currently considered responsible for generating X-ray in these objects are primarily: (a) Synchrotron self-Compton model; (b) Two temperature thermal Bremsstrahlung model; and (c) Thermal Compton models (involving black-holes and accretion disks where thermal electrons give rise to inverse-Compton scattering of photons. Each model anticipates different manners of UV emission from these objects.  The X-ray flux varies by as much as a factor of 100 in the BL Lac objects, while the X-ray flux from at least two emission-line galaxies are also variable. This makes it essential that X-ray and UV observations be made simultaneously. The IUE and HEAO satellites are the only ones capable of performing such observations within the next few years.|Y
XGFCB|Far UV Spectroscopy of X-Ray Active Galactic Nuclei|C. Stuart|Bowyer|UC Berkeley|We propose to observe the five optically brightest active galactic nuclei (AGN's) discovered as part of our continuing program to identify the optical counterparts of X-ray sources. These bright AGN's provide an opportunity to compare the far UV spectra of X-ray AGN's with existing IUE spectra of optically selected, X-ray quiet QSO's and Seyfert galaxies, and this comparison is the prime motivation for this proposal. These objects all appear at low redshifts (Z = .023 to .128) and have bright emission-line optical spectra which appear otherwise quite similar to the spectra of non-X-ray-emitting AGN's. We expect to easily detect H Ly-alpha 1216, CIV 1549, and MgII  2798 emission lines from all five objects and may detect H Ly beta from two of them. Continuum emission should also be detected from all 5 sources, allowing us to look for broad Ly-alpha absorption at the emissionline redshift. Detection of such absorption would give a direct measurement of the covering factor; otherwise upper limits can be set based on the signal to noise in the continuum. To be consistent with existing models the X-ray active AGN's should exhibit very little absorption due to the high level of ionizing radiation enamanating from the central energy source. In addition, we will be able to measure i) the ratios of Ly-alpha to H-beta intensities, which have been shown to be inconsistent with a simple optically thick recombination model in optically-selected QSO's and ii) the Ly-alpha and CIV equivalent widths, which appear to be relatively larger for low luminosity AGN's. In three of our proposed sources the optical lines are broad enough that we should also obtain line shape information on the Ly-alpha, CIV, and MgII lines.|Y
XGFGR|Ultraviolet Studies of X-Ray Selected Active Galactic Nuclei|Gail A.|Reichert|NASA/GSFC|We propose IUE observations of optically bright, X-ray selected active galactic nuclei (AGN) in order to study possible relationships between their ultraviolet and X-ray emissions. In particular, we wish to test the suggestion of Malkan and Sargent (1982) -- that some fraction of the optical luminosity (at short wavelengths) in AGN is unrelated to their X-ray emission, and that an increase of this fraction with increasing total optical luminosity Lopt causes the ratio of X-ray to optical luminosity Lx/Lopt to decrease. Such an effect, if substantiated, would have important implications regarding processes of energy generation in AGN and the AGN contribution to the cosmic X-ray background.|Y
XGHCB|Far UV Spectroscopy of the Optical Emission Knots in the Inner Jet of CEN A|C. Stuart|Bowyer|Berkeley|We propose to perform IUE spectroscopy of a series of optical emission knots in the innermost region of the Centaurus A jet which we have identified through ground-based spectroscopy on the 4m telescope at CTIO. Two of these regions coincide with X-ray and radio knots, providing the first evidence for a direct link between the X-ray and radio knots and line-emitting features in the jet; our optical spectroscopy has also revealed an apparent flare in the emission line intensities near the outer boundary of the interknot region. Our analysis of the existing data suggests that the optical line and continuum emissions are not representative of normal HII regions and are probably produced by shock heating or photoionization by a power-law continuum. Far UV spectroscopy offers a ready test of this interpretation, as a number of strong emission lines are predicted to be visible to the IUE based on models of the emission produced by a jet-like flow of ~100 km/sec through material of cosmic abundance. Furthermore, the measurement of continuum emission at X-ray, optical, and radio wavelengths from the same emission knots has allowed us to place significant constraints on the synchrotron radiation spectrum: in particular, we have noted an apparent "break" in the continuum near 6 x 10^14 Hz which may be attributable to synchrotron radiation losses. Our proposed IUE observations should he sufficiently sensitive to discriminate between single or multiple synchrotron components responsible for this continuum.|Y
XGIFB|Condensations in Cooling Flows of X-Ray Emitting Cluster Gas|Frederick C.|Bruhweiler|Catholic University|Recent H-alpha emission line imagery of X-ray emitting clusters of galaxies has revealed large, bright gaseous condensations in the cooling flows of the central regions of several clusters. Our predictions based upon the visual results, indicate that these condensations are bright at UV wavelengths. We propose to observe a bright condensation in the cluster A1795. These observations will give strong constraints on cooling models and elemental abundances in this gas. Such observations will further give important information on whether this gas has been significantly enriched by elements lighter than the iron group from the galaxies in the cluster.|Y
XGMCU|Multifrequency Observations of Z-Ray-Bright BL Lac Objects|C. Megan|Urry|STScI|Ten BL Lacertae objects discovered in the HEAO1 all-sky survey are brighter than 1 Uhuru flux unit (1 UFU ~= 2.4 x 10^-11 ergs cm^-2 s^-1), bright enough to yield useful spectral and variability information from the Ginga hard-X-ray satellite (2-30 keV) and the ROSAT extreme-ultraviolet/soft-X-ray satellite. These X-ray-selected BL Lacs have their peak emission in the far-ultraviolet or soft X-ray regimes, in contrast to the more traditional radio-selected BL Lacs. The ultraviolet -through- X-ray spectra of BL Lac objects, and any attendant variability, have important implications for the energetics and structure of BL Lacs. Furthermore, broad-band spectroscopy is a sensitive probe of the underlying energygeneration mechanism in BL Lacs, which may be related to that in other AGN.  We propose to make coordinated, simultaneous observations using the IUE satellite in conjunction with ROSAT, Ginga, Voyager 2 (a far-ultraviolet spectrometer), and groundbased radio, submillimeter, infrared, and optical telescopes, in order to obtain the best possible broad-band spectra of BL Lac objects. These will be used to constrain models for the emitting region, as we have demonstrated during previous years of our ongoing IUE program. All ten targets will be easily detected in the ROSAT all-sky survey; furthermore, we have already been awarded time for longer ROSAT pointed observations of four of these BL Lacs, for which we therefore propose to repeat the multifrequency experiment. The proposed combination of instruments covers ten decades in frequency with unprecedented sensitivity and energy resolution. Understanding AGN is one of the primary questions in astrophysics; IUE has the potential to make important advances toward answering this question.|Y
XGPRC|Ultraviolet Observations of X-Ray-Luminous Spiral Galaxies|Ross D.|Cohen|UC San Diego|The recently completed Einstein (Medium Sensitivity) and ROSAT all-sky X-ray surveys have identified a small but potentially important category of galaxies which are far more luminous in X-rays than normal spirals, and yet display optical spectra that are not typical of Seyfert ls. The most likely explanation is that they are either Seyfert 2s, with a high (~10%) scattering efficiency of their ionizing continuum, or extreme "superstarbursts" with a high X-ray/blue luminosity ratio. The latter possibility has important implications for the origin of the low-energy X-ray background.  IUE measurements of the continuum and spectral features of these galaxies will enable us to determine the primary origin of these galaxies' enhanced X-ray emission, which is the subject of our on-going program of multi-frequency observations.|Y
XLHJL|A Peculiar Hot X-Ray Star in the LMC|James W.|Liebert|Arizona|One double shift is requested to obtain full SWP and LWP exposures on the unusual soft X-ray source in the LMC, found in the survey of X-ray sources in the Magellanic Clouds. The appearance of high excitation, optical emission lines suggests that this X-ray binary may have a very hot, evolved star.|Y
XLICU|Coorinated Observations of X-Ray Bright BL Lacertae Objests from X-Ray to Radio Wavelengths|C. Megan|Urray|Massachusetts Institute of Technology|We propose to use the IUE satellite to observe six BL Lacertae objects as part of a comprehensive program of complete, quasi-simultaneous spectral coverage in the radio, visual, ultraviolet, and X-ray wavebands. All of our targets are known X-ray sources, and all have now been observed with IUE. The composite spectra obtained, as well as any observed variability in the emission, are probes of the physical processes occurring in these sources, and can be used to constrain models for the emitting region.|Y
XLIJH|X-Ray Selected BL LAC Objects|Jules P.|Halpern|Columbia University|X-ray selected BL Lac objects have very flat power laws extending from the radio through the optical. This is in contrast to all other BL Lacs, which have much steeper optical slopes, indicating a synchrotron break around 1 micron. In several cases, the optically thin synchrotron spectrum of X-ray selected BL Lacs reaches into the ultraviolet with a slope of ~0.4, indicating recent or ongoing injection of energetic particles. We propose to observe three new bright X-ray selected BL Lacs to test the hypothesis, using an increased sample, that the synchrotron break frequency is at or above ultraviolet energies in this class.|Y
XQEMS|Ultraviolet Observations of a Sample of X-Ray Emitting Qsos|Michael L.|Sitko|Minnesota|We propose to observe 8 QSOs which exhibit X-ray emission to study the relationship between the steep spectral index seen at X-ray wavelengths and the smaller index seen at optical wavelengths. In particular, we hope to detect the spectral break seen near lambda ~1200A in some QSOs and which may be related to the optical-X-ray index change.|Y
XQERG|Bright Optically Selected Quasars with High X-Ray Flux|Richard F.|Green|Arizona|We propose to obtain ultraviolet spectrophotometry of eight quasars and high luminosity Seyfert galaxies from the subset of the Palomar Bright Quasar Survey with the highest X-ray flux as measured by the EINSTEIN observatory. We hope to obtain X-ray spectral energy distributions of 15 Palomar quasars with EXOSAT; this proposal is to obtain complementary ultraviolet energy distributions for seven objects never before observed with IUE and for one exceptional object requiring reobservation.  We are motivated by three scientific objectives. The first is to begin to unravel the contribution to the observed spectrum radiating directly from the central energy source from that made by various reprocessing mechanisms, such as thermal sources with a range of temperatures or inverse Compton scattering. The ultraviolet fluxes from IUE will be combined with Palomar 5-m multichannel spectrophotometry, infrared, millimeter, and VLA radio measurements, as well as EINSTEIN and EXOSAT X-ray fluxes to obtain as complete a picture as possible of the total radiation from each system. Our second goal is to study the effect of enhanced X-ray flux on the broad emission-line region, in particular, on spectral features arising from the warm region of the optically thick clouds, such as the Balmer lines, Mg II, and the 3000 A bump. Finally, we wish to investigate the changes in emission line profile asymmetries as a function of X-ray flux and to interpret the results in the context of dynamical models with possible screening by dust.|Y
XQFRG|Bright Optically Selected Quasars with High X-Ray Flux|Richard F.|Green|Arizona|We propose to obtain ultraviolet spectrophotometry of six quasars and high luminosity Seyfert galaxies from the subset of the Palomar Bright Quasar Survey with the highest X-ray flux as measured by the EINSTEIN observatory.

XQGMS|Multifrequency Observations of Two Variable X-Ray Emitting Qsos|Michael L.|Sitko|Minnesota|I propose to obtain UV spectra of two variable X-ray QSOs. These observations will be coordinated with simultaneous observations at other wavelengths.  These data will be used to define and restrict models of the emission mechanism in these objects.|Y
XQHME|QSOS With IPC X-Ray Spectra|Martin S.|Elvis|Harvard CFA - SAO|We propose to obtain UV spectrophotometry for the 8 QSOs for which we have X-ray spectra and which are bright enough to observe with IUE. The X-ray spectra come from the newly calibrated Image Proportional Counter (IPC) on the EINSTEIN Observatory. They show a variety of forms suggesting that the important UV/X-ray continuum changes greatly from object to object. These IUE spectra will be combined with quasi simultaneous visual and IR photometry to generate a map of the energy distribution over a broad range of energies for these QSOs. Our scientific objectives are as follows: to study the relation of the different components to the continuum emission to one another over a number of objects; to utilize the results of this study to determine the physical emission mechanisms in each case; to combine X-ray and UV photometry to estimate the amount of ionising radiation available for each object (knowledge of the soft X-ray spectral index facilitates higher accuracy than ever before); to investigate the effect of the amount of ionising radiation and other continuum properties on the strengths and profile shapes of the broad and narrow UV and optical,  emission lines.|Y
XQHMS|Multifrequency Observations of GQ Comae|Michael L.|Sitko|Aura|I propose to observe the ultraviolet flux variations of GQ Comae (Q 1202+281) and combine these with nearly simultaneous ground-based optical-infrared photometry. These data will be used to study the relationship between the components that give rise to the emission in these wavelength regions.|Y
XQIME|QSO'S with IPC X-Ray Spectra|Martin S.|Elvis|Harvard CFA - SAO|We propose to obtain both short and long wavelength ultraviolet spectrophotometry of 5 bright quasars that have well-determined x-ray spectra. Together with the quasars in our current IUE program and seven from the IUE data archive these objects will form the basis of a reasonably sized sample. For this sample we have in hand (or are in the process of obtaining) ground-based optical and infrared spectra and photometry and IRAS co-add data. Together these data define the quasars' continuum from ~100 microns to ~7 keV, (5 decades of frequency). The IUE data have particular importance for defining the optical-UV 'big bump' (accretion disk?) and the "300OA" 'small bump' due to Balmer continuum and FeII emission. The definition of these features is essential to the testing of the accretion disk hypothesis and particular disk models; the determination of the EUV ionizing spectrum, and the testing of the optically thick photoionization models.|Y
XQIMS|Multifrequency Observations of GQ Comae-II|Michael L.|Sitko|Noao|I propose to continue observing ultraviolet flux variations of GQ Comae (Q 1202+281) and combine these with nearly simultaneous ground-based opticalinfrared photometry. These data will be used to study the relationship between the components that give rise to the emission in these wavelength regions.|Y
XQJCU|Coordinated Observations of X-Ray Bright Bl Lacertae Objects|C. Megan|Urry|MIT|We propose to use the IUE satellite to observe eight BL Lacertae objects as part of a continuing, comprehensive program of quasi-simultaneous spectral coverage in the radio, infrared, visual, ultraviolet, and X-ray wavebands.

XQJJH|New X-Ray Bright Quasars|Jules P.|Halpern|Columbia University|Two new X-ray selected quasars are unusually bright in the X-ray and optical. E1821+643 has a very soft X-ray excess of the type which has been interpreted as the high-energy tail of the EUV emission from an accretion disk. This is the highest redshift object (z=0.297) for which such a two-component X-ray spectrum has been established. An IUE spectrum of E1821+643 will extend nearly to the Lyman limit, and the combined X-ray/IUE coverage may provide the best delineation of a "big bump" for comparison with models of accretion disks. The second object, H0558-504 (Z=0.137), is an extremely luminous example of the I Zw 1 class since it is a narrow-line quasar (FWHM~1500 km/s) with strong Fe II lines. It has been claimed that I Zw 1 objects are preferentially selected by soft X-ray detectors because they have steep spectra. This can be due to an accretion disk or a steep power law. UV data will help to discriminate between these possibilities. Because the Fe II blends are resolved, H0558-504 will also be important as a test of the detailed photoionization models which include hundreds of Fe II lines.|Y
XQJME|QSOS with IPC X-Ray Spectra|Martin S.|Elvis|Harvard CFA - SAO|Observations with the Einstein IPC have produced a unique sample of 33 quasars with well determined soft x-ray spectra. 24 of these are bright enough to be observed with IUE. Our previous programs in years 8 and 9 have obtained spectra of many of the opticall-selected PG quasars In the IPC sample. With this proposal we aim to complete IUE coverage for the bright objects in the sample. This primarily requires observations of radio-laud quasars. The x-ray results show a clear difference In the properties of radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars. With the new data collected from this proposed program we can see if these differences extend into the neighboring ultraviolet region.|Y
XQKBW|QSO's with IPC X-ray Spectra|Belinda J.|Wilkes|Harvard CFA - SAO|Observations with the Einstein IPC produced a unique sample of 33 quasars with well-determined soft X-ray spectra. 24 of these are bright enough to be observed with IUE.

With this proposal we aim to complete IUE coverage for the two remaining bright objects in the sample. The X-ray results show a clear difference in the properties of radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars. With the new data collected from this proposed program we can see if these differences extend into the neighboring ultraviolet region.|Y

XROBW|Range of Continuum Properties and the UV/Soft X-Ray Connection for Quasars|Belinda J.|Wilkes|Harvard CFA - SAO|The new availability of ROSAT and the continued operation of IUE provides us with a unique and invaluable window of opportunity to obtain contemporaneous UV/soft X-ray data for quasars outside the limited existing samples which are X-ray bright and low redshift. We have been awarded ROSAT observing time (~ Feb 1991-Apr 1992) to obtain X-ray spectra of 49 quasars (38 guaranteed time). The sample includes objects at a wide range of redshift, radio and X-ray loudness as well as other continuum properties such as optical and IR loudness. We propose to obtain ultra-violet spectrophotometry for the 24 objects (21 guaranteed) in our sample bright enough to be observed with IUE, within ~1 year of the X-ray observations. Combined with ground-based data this will fully determine the shape of the IR/X-ray energy distribution with IUE and ROSAT providing a strong constraint in the EUV. With this sample we will study the range and evolution in the shape of the optical/UV blue bump component and its relation to the soft X-ray excess, the emission lines and other continuum properties. We will investigate possible models including thermal emission from an accretion disk and free-free emission, both globally for the sample and for individual objects.|Y
XROCS|X-Ray Transients as Targets of Opportunity|Chris R.|Shrader|CSC - GRO|I propose to observe newly discovered transient X-ray sources as targets of opportunity with IUE. The so called "Soft X-ray Transients" (SXTs) such as A0620-00 and GRS 1124-684 (Nova Muscae 1991) have outburst x-ray luminosities 10^2 - 10^6 times greater than in quiescence and corresponding increases of up to 6 or 7 in mB. They often remain in outburst for tens of days in X-rays, and slightly longer in blue-UV wavelengths. Blue-UV emission is believed to be reprocessed emission from X-ray heated material in an accretion disk or the on face of the secondary. The Be star transients, or Hard X-Ray Transients, can also exhibit remarkable energetics, and can remain in outburst for days to weeks. Both classes of transients are poorly studied in the ultraviolet. Ultraviolet data can provide insight into details of the mass accretion flows, the physics of the X-ray heated material, the evolutionary state of the secondary and possibly into the nature of the instabilities leading to outburst. The 1991 transient X-Ray Nova Muscae fit the "canonical" picture rather well and our success in sampling critical stages of its evolution, as well as our preliminary success in modeling the continuum energy distribution demonstrate the value of the proposed research program.|Y
XRPTS|UV Observations of Young X-Ray Emitting Stars in the IC 2391 Cluster|Theodore|Simon|U Hawaii|We propose to conduct a mini-census of the UV chromospheric emission of the southern star cluster IC 2391, which will complement a very deep X ray survey of coronal emission we have recently made with ROSAT. Because of its extreme youth, a large spread in chromospheric and coronal emission in this cluster will conclusively establish that low mass stars have a broad range in dynamo activity when they first arrive on the ZAMS and that existing time decay laws for activity and rotation are therefore invalid.|Y
XRRWF|X-Ray and "O VI Sequence" Planetary Nebulae|Walter A.|Feibelman|NASA/GSFC|Only about a dozen of the more than 1500 known planetary nebulae are confirmed x-ray sources, and for an additional dozen or so upper limits of x-ray emission has been detected. Several of the known x-ray sources, and some "O  VI Sequence" planetaries, have not yet been observed by IUE. We propose to observe these objects for the first time in the low resolution mode of the SWP camera and also obtain high resolution spectra of three objects. The proposed targets are high excitation planetaries and should show strong P Cygni profiles for N V, 0 V, and C IV, and He II emission, based on the "heat conduction front" model of Soker (1994) and a recent study by Feibelman (1994). From these observations we will determine terminal wind velocities and mass loss rates, as well as T(eff) of the central stars and other parameters. Since the class of objects of concern here is so small, it is important to get UV observations for a statistically complete set as possible.|Y
XSAKD|Ultraviolet Investigations of Stellar X-Ray Sources|Andrea K.|Dupree|Harvard CFA - SAO|Abstract unavailable|N
XSBAD|Ultraviolet Studies of Soft X-Ray Sources|Andrea K.|Dupree|Smithsonian|We propose to observe several kinds of soft-X-ray sources with IUE in order to obtain information about cooler gas than that responsible for the X-rays, and to infer the X-ray source spectrum at low energies. The objects fall into several categories: a) Cataclysmic variables. We have observed SS Cyg already, finding a rich emission-line spectrum at minimum light. We propose further observations to study the variations in the spectrum during and after eruption.  b) Close binaries--AM Her, Sco X-1. These objects show a wealth of emission lines. Because of their irregular variability and because of the extremely short period of AM Her, further observations would be very useful.  c) "Coronal" or "flare" X-ray sources. This category includes RS CVn stars and dMe stars. Both HR 4665 and 1099 have been observed with IUE and show N V, Si IV, O I, C II, Si II, Si III, C IV, and He II emission. These objects are extremely variable, and some may be observable only during flares. Observations of UV resonance lines and optically thin emission will provide a much clearer picture of physical conditions over a wide range of temperature and density.|Y
XSDRS|Variability of Chromospheric & Transition Region UV Emission Lines in X-Ray Active Cool Stars|R.|Stern|JPL|We propose to study intensity variations on high temperature transition region lines (C IV, SI IV, NV) and reversals in Mg II chromospheric lines of x-ray active cool stars. These stars have been chosen from a list of HEAO-1 or Einstein sources with stellar identifications; several are spectroscopic binaries. By observing these stars a number of times throughout their binary period, or stellar rotation period, and at intervals of ~6 months to a year apart, we will be better able to estimate the range of variability.|Y
XSJRB|Ultraviolet Observations of X-Ray Selected Seyfert Galaxies|Roger|Brissenden|Australian National University|Thirty-six Active Galactic Nuclei have been discovered recently ( 1982 1986), during an ongoing program to Identify the optical counterparts of X-ray sources detected by HEAO- I experiments. From this group, we have selected a sample of bright, southern, Seyfert type I galaxies targeted for detailed study at radio, Infrared, optical, and UV wavelengths. The sample has a visual magnitude range of 14.0 - 15.9 and represents an important Increase in the number of bright, X-ray selected, Seyfert I galaxies. Optical spectra of these objects have been obtained using the 3.9 m Anglo-Australian telescope, and several objects show spectral signs of unusual high-energy activity (e.g. Fe X emission and X-ray variability in one case, another with extremely broad H lines, and several are among the leaders In the Xray/optical flux ratio).  We propose IUE observations to measure the strength of the UV emission lines, particularly Ly-alpha, and the strength and slope of the UV continuum. Such data will allow the investigation of ( I ) the global properties of the continue, from radio to X-ray wavelengths, (2) correlation measures for a large range and variety of near-simultaneous observations, (3) the anomalous Ly-alpha / H-beta ratio seen In Seyfert galaxies, (4) the thermal UV-excess or 'UV bump' for an X-ray selected sample, (5) comparisons with Seyfert I galaxies with other selection properties (e.g. optically selected, radio bright, etc. ), and (6) a UV spectral probe of the Individual cases that show unusual high-energy activity.  Simultaneous ground-based observations are planned, since the continuum and emission lines of Seyfert galaxies may vary on a timescale of weeks.|Y
XSMJH|Central Stars Detected in the Soft X-Ray|Jay B.|Holberg|Arizona|We propose IUE observations of a set planetary nebulae central stars which have been detected in the soft X-ray by EXOSAT and Einstein. Two types of observations are proposed. First, small aperture observations will be obtained to determine accurate H I columns to 4 central stars. These observations rely on the measurement of the Lorentz wings of the observed Lyman-alpha profiles. Second, a high dispersion image of the central star of NGC 6853 will be obtained. This will be used to determine the photospheric metal content of this star. H I columns are of great interest not only to studies of the interstellar medium but are also critical quantities for the proper interpretation of existing and anticipated soft X-ray observations of these objects. In particular, the simplest analyses of broad band soft X-ray observations of degenerates dwarfs often lead to a correlation, of correlations, between effective temperature and interstellar absorption (H I). These correlations, frequently allow a wide range of possible effective temperatures. In the case of He-rich degenerates, metals may play a critical role in determining soft X-ray opacity. Independent knowledge of both the H I column and metal abundance considerably reduces the uncertainty in all parameters. In addition to our proposed targets, we also intend to make full use of the existing archive data on 4 additional PNNs detected in the soft X-ray.|Y
XTNCS|X-Ray Transients as Targets of Opportrunity|Chris R.|Shrader|CSC - GRO|I propose to observe newly discovered transient X-ray sources as targets of opportunity with IUE.

They often remain in outburst for tens of days in X-rays, and slightly longer in blue-UV wavelengths. The blue-UV emission is believed to be reprocessed X-rays from material in an accretion disk or the face of the secondary. The Be star transients can also exhibit remarkable energetics, and can remain in outburst for days to weeks. These classes high energy transients are at present poorly studied in the ultraviolet, a region which is of fundamental importance in testing current modeling scenarios. Ultraviolet data may also provide insight into details of the mass accretion flows and into the nature of the instabilities leading to outburst.|Y
XTQCS|X-Ray Transients as Targets of Opportunity|Chris|Shrader|NASA/GSFC|We propose to observe newly discovered transient X-ray sources as targets of opportunity with IUE as part of a multiwavelength campaign which includes ground- and space-based support utilizing the Lowell 1.7-m and 1.1-m telescopes, the VLA and the Compton GRO/BATSE all-sky monitor experiment. The focus will be on the so called "Soft X-ray Transients" (SXTs), also known as X-ray Nova, which are a sub-class of the low mass X-ray binaries. Examples include A0620-00 and GRS1124-684 (Nova Muscae 1991) and more recently, GRO J0422+32.  They have outburst x-ray luminosities 10^2-10^6 times greater than in quiescence and corresponding increases of up to 6 or 7 in m(b) and often remain in outburst for tens of days. Blue-UV emission is believed to be reprocessed emission from X-ray heated material in an accretion disk or the on face of the secondary combined with thermal emission resulting from viscous dissipation of the disk. This, combined with their dramatic evolution on observable time-scales, makes them unique astrophysical laboratories. They remain only sparsely studied in the ultraviolet. Ultraviolet data can provide insight into details of the mass accretion flow, the physics of the X-ray heated material, constraints on chemical abundances, the source distance, the overall energy budget and potentially into the nature of the outburst mechanism itself. The 1991 transient X-Ray Nova Muscae, and the more recent GRO J0422+32, covered under this program in episodes 13 and 15 respectively were both highly successful campaigns leading to unprecedented UV coverage of SXT outbursts. A major goal of this proposed research is to supplement these databases by obtaining early and frequent sampling.|Y

YBMMP|EK Cephei: A Binary with A T Tauri Star?|Mirek J.|Plavec|UCLA|There exist fairly convincing arguments that in the eclipsing binary system EK Cephei (HD 206821), the secondary star is still contracting to the main sequence. The arguments are as follows: (1) From the surface gravity of the primary (Al.5 V) star, the primary (2 m(sun)) lies very close to the zero-age main sequence. Therefore, the less massive secondary (1.1 m(sun)) must be even less evolved. (2) However, the secondary has a radius almost as large as the primary, and definitely larger than it should have as a main-sequence object. (3) The flux distribution of the secondary star is also anomalous; in particular, it displays a 'blue excess" probably extending into the UV.  If the conclusion drawn from these facts, namely that the secondary is a pre-MS object, is correct, then EK Cephei is one of only two known eclipsing binaries containing a pre-MS object. Since the mass of the secondary is accurately determined, it is important to obtain as much data as possible about the system in order to have a rare check on the models of pre-MS evolution.  I propose to obtain IUE spectra for the following purposes: (1) To check and determine more firmly the effective temperature of the primary star. (2) To search for the extension of the "blue excess" to shorter wavelengths. (3) To search for all other signatures of a T Tauri star, i.e. for emissions in Mg II and other typical lines. There is some indication from the Catalogue of Stellar Ultraviolet Fluxes that the flux excess may exist and be observable.|Y
YZRKC|Coordinated Space and Ground-Based Observations of the Flare Star YZ CMi|Kenneth G.|Carpenter|NASA/GSFC|We propose IUE ultraviolet observations of the flare star YZ CMi to complement high time resolution data to be acquired with the Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph on Hubble Space Telescope and other ground and space-based observatories including the AAT, ROSAT, and EUVE. The HST observations are designed to search for the signature of downflowing proton beams during flare events and to estimate their importance in providing the energy that powers the flare. These IUE observations, which include the full range of transition region and chromospheric lines, are critical to determining the energy balance and atmospheric structure of any flare observed. The extended dataset, including non-flare spectra, will allow us to characterize the overall activity level of the star at the time of the observations, and thus place the events in the proper context.|Y
ZACAM|IUE Observations of Nebular Emission in Symbiotic Stars|A. G.|Michalitsianos|NASA/GSFC|IUE observing time is requested to observe a selected number of symbiotic variables in both low and high dispersion. Previous emission line and continuum observations of R Aqr obtained in low dispersion suggest the presence of a low excitation nebula whose source of ionization is a luminous white dwarf. Ambiguity in line identification from low dispersion spectra (~6 A resolution) of certain spectral features raises some doubt concerning nebular parameters of electron density and temperature that have been derived from [O II], [O III] and [O IV] line intensities. High resolution observations of R Aqr (~0.l A resolution) will resolve these questions. IUE observations of RW Hya also suggest an ionized nebula but with far higher excitation than that observed in R Aqr. The large differences in the UV continuum and emission line spectrum between these two stars suggests that symbiotic objects might be defined by a distinct class of emission that is most likely determined to a large extent by the intrinsic luminosity and physical nature of the hot companion. A selected target list of proposed stars is given.|Y
ZACJH|UV Observations of the Eclipsing Symbiolic Star AR Pav|J. B.|Hutchings|Dominion Astrophysical Observatory|We wish to observe the eclipse of the hot component in the symbiotic binary AR Pav to determine the nature of the hot star, to study the stratification and mass motions in the dense enveloping nebula, and to investigate the mass flow between the stars. In the optical region one can only observe the eclipse of the nebula, and thus the size and nature of the blue star is unknown. Although the eclipse of the central star itself will probably only last a few hours in the UV, the eclipse of the more extended hot emission regions should continue for a number of days.|Y
ZACMP|Diagnostical Studies of Symbiotic Stars|M.|Plavec|UCLA|We are requesting about 40 hours of observing time to observe a selected group of symbiotic stars. Both high and low dispersion scans will be made in both cameras. Complementary ground-based spectral scans will be obtained in the range 3200 - 8600 A in a well-established, continuing observing program at Lick Observatory. Mary of the stars have already been observed at Lick or at Cerro Tololo. The interstellar reddening correction, individual luminosities, radii, and effective temperatures of the components, and system distances will be obtained from analysis of the combined data. Emission line intensities and profiles will be analyzed in conjunction with optical data to determine the temperature, density, and structure of the emitting regions. Some elemental abundances will be determined and theoretical models will be employed to calculate the thermal and ionization structure of the emitting material near the hot component. We would like to emphasize two important aspects of this proposal: (1) Systematic combination of the IUE data with matching scanner data from Lick (some of them already in existence), (2) The availability of an excellent program (Balick-Aller-Keyes) for studying the structure of the emitting regions. The ultimate goal is to classify symbiotic objects into more homogeneous categories, and to find relations between these categories and other objects (binary stars, planetary nebulae).|Y

ZADAB|A Study of Temporal Variations in the Spectrum of HM SGE|Albert|Boggess|NASA/GSFC|The scientific objective of the proposed observing program is the continuation of our study of temporal variations in the UV spectrum of HM Sge. This rapidly varying, emission-line object is believed to be a young planetary nebula in its early stages of formation. Low dispersion spectra which can be spectro-photometrically calibrated are required for further studying the temporal variations in emission line fluxes found during five epochs of observing spread over the first three years of observing HM Sge with the IUE. High dispersion spectra are required to separate some closely spaced emission lines and to resolve astrophysically significant doublets used as diagonistics in an interpretation of physical conditions in the plasma which is giving rise to the emission lines in HM Sge. Spectra in both the short and long wavelength ranges are required so as to cover the entire spectral region lying between the N V doublet at 1240A and the He II line at 3204A. A series of low dispersion spectra obtained sequentially with no changes other than alternating between the two cameras is also desireable for checking on the repeatability of successive observations of an emission-line object with the IUE and, hopefully, for indicating whether variations in the spectrum over intervals of a few hours also may occur. These data will be used, together with earlier data, in an attempt to better identify the nature of HM Sge and to document the changes in this enigmatic, rapidly evolving object.|Y
ZADAM|Ultraviolet Observations of M-Type Symbiotic Stars|Andrew G.|Michalitsianos|NASA/GSFC|The significant differences revealed in high dispersion short wavelength spectra of two M-type symbiotic stars RW Hya (gM2 + pec) and RX Pup (M5 + pec) observed previously with IUE emphasizes the need for high resolution observations of a wide range of similar objects. The anomalies observed in high excitation lines in RX Pup of He II, N III], N IV], O III], C III], C IV and Si III] that show split line profiles, multiple component Doppler displaced components, and broadened blue wing emission structure in N III] and N IV] suggest motion in circumstellar material. In contrast, high dispersion UV spectra of RW Hya reveal narrow high excitation emission lines that give no suggestion of macroscopic motions in the circumstellar gas. We wish to extend observations of a selected number of symbiotic stars observed previously but in low resolution, to high dispersion in order to determine if particular M-type symbiotic stars exhibit anomalies in their line profile. As such, symbiotic stars exhibiting velocity structure in emission lines may form a subset of objects that are characterized by mass motions in their circumstellar envelops that create high excitation emission. UV line and continuum emission from other M-type symbiotics may arise from mainly photo-excitation processes that results from the intense radiation field associated with the hot secondary companion.|Y
ZADMK|Ultraviolet Observations of the Peculiar Emission-Line      Objects RX Puppis|Minas|Kafatos|George Mason University|The interesting spectral features of RX Puppis observed by us in high dispersion emphasize the need for further high dispersion observations in order to determine possible time variability. RX Puppis has been classified a symbiotic star, and has been compared to eta Carinae, or slow nova like objects; it has been shown to be associated with a Mira, although the continuum from such a star has never been seen in the visible. Additionally, it exhibits an appreciable amount of thermal dust emission similar to the slow nova RR Telescopii. It exhibits a high degree of variability in the visible as well as in the radio continuum. The anomalies observed by us in high excitation lines RX Pup such as He II, O III], C III], C IV, and Si III], that show split lines profiles, Doppler displaced multiple components, and possible inverse PCygni profiles in N III] and N IV] suggest dynamic activity in circumstellar material that probably has the form of rings and/or gas streamers, most likely directed at the hot companion. P-Cygni profiles in the Balmer lines suggest an expansion of (possibly) similar rings. Due to the close association of RX Puppis with symbiotic star systems and slow novae it would be extremely useful to observe this object over a period of a year to establish the time dependent nature of the complex emission structures observed in high excitation emission profiles. A description of our observing program and analysis of IUE data is described briefly.|Y
ZADRS|A Study of the MG II Profiles in the UV Spectra of Symbiotic Stars|Robert E.|Stencel|Colorado|We wish to undertake an exploration of the circumstellar and nebular environment of symbiotic binaries via LWR high dispersion mode Mg II region exposures to distinguish the nature and degree of binary interaction. The observed structure of the Mg II 2800A resonance doublet bears a striking generic similarity to those seen in the binary Zeta Aur during its recent eclipse. In addition to this multiple peaked emission structure, the total flux in Mg II for symbiotics greatly exceeds any normal single cool star of giant or supergiant type, as is also the case for Zeta Aur. The synoptic coverage of Zeta Aur systems in and out of eclipse suggests that the nebular and circumstellar phenomena seen therein, find their extreme expression among the symbiotic stars. We wish to explore this similarity, and in view of the surprising lack of LWR high dispersion observations of symbiotics, request IUE observing time for the purpose. Previously observed and published IUE data will be drawn upon to complement the new observations in the search for binary variations.|Y
ZAELW|UV Line Variations in Mira Symbiotics|Lee Anne|Willson|Iowa State|We propose to observe symbiotic stars with the IUE at high dispersion, with emphasis on those systems suspected to contain Mira variables. This will provide constraints on the velocities of the various high excitation components of these complicated systems, and in conjunction with infrared and optical spectroscopic observations being proposed simultaneously should considerably clarify the nature of the mass exchange interaction. These systems, also referred to as "d" symbiotic systems since they contain dust, show both evidence of extremely cool circumstellar material and, at least after an eruption, extremely hot material (very high ionization states and soft X-rays). We propose to test our particular interacting winds model, which involves a low velocity, high density, wind from the giant or Mira star and a high velocity, low density wind from the collapsed object. This model predicts multiple line components with systematic variations as a function of ionization potential, and a correlation between excitation and line width for individual features.|Y
ZAEMK|Observations of Symbiotic Stars in the Magellanic Clouds|Minas C.|Kafatos|George Mason University|It would be extremely important to observe the three known symbiotics in the Magellanic Clouds using IUE. We can estimate the foreground reddening in our galaxy and in the Clouds themselves and, therefore. deduce the intrinsic reddening in the symbiotic systems themselves. Since the distances to the two Clouds are known we are not faced with the usual problem of distance uncertainties and the absolute ultraviolet flux of the hot secondary can be estimated, a very difficult task for galactic symbiotics. Moreover, since the chemical abundances are known to be different in the Clouds compared to the galaxy, it would be important to see whether the symbiotics in our galaxy and the ones in the Clouds look the same and what the effects of chemical abundances in the evolution of these stars are. We are confident that these observations will prove successful since planetary nebulae in the Clouds were observed by Maran. Aller, Gull and Stecker to be unusually bright in the UV and symbiotics are closely related to planetaries. Our observing program and method of data analysis are described.|Y
ZAFMK|Observations of Peculiar UV Emission in RX Puppis|Minas C.|Kafatos|George Mason University|We propose 6th year IUE observations of the peculiar object RX Puppis. This object is returning to the symbiotic, high excitation state that it exhibited forty years. Our previous IUE observations of RX Puppis revealed unique UV line profile structure in the high resolution SWP mode of IUE, that includes split and multiple component line profile structure in high excitation intercombination and resonance emission lines. The line profile structure suggests the existence of rings and/or streamers in this system. Future observations in the UV will enable us to determine the temporal properties of the hot component in this system. Of particular importance in 1983 here in our high resolution studies is determining the time-dependent variations in line profile structure with excitation, since streamers and rings suggest a highly turbulent gaseous system. Low resolution observations will further enable us to study variations in emission line intensities in order to monitor nebular parameters (ne,Te) in the object. The complex emission structure observed over a wide variety of wavelengths renders RX Puppis unique among the general family of peculiar emission line objects. The objectives of this observing proposal and our method of data analysis follows.|Y
ZAFNO|The Geometric Structure of Eclipsing Symbiotic Binaries|Nancy A.|Oliversen|CSC|Our objective is to refine the current models for the geometric structure and the extent of ionized and nebular material in symbiotic stars. This will be done by obtaining UV spectra at critical phases for the three classical symbiotic stars, CI Cygni, EG Andromedae, and AX Persei, which present data suggests are eclipsing binary systems. New observations are essential because the long periods of these systems (470 to 855 days) have only permitted partial phase UV coverage over one orbital cycle, typically, and the only way to discriminate between transient and permanent structures (streams, disks, etc.) is to demonstrate phase repeatability. Because of possible similarities in structure between symbiotics and cataclysmic variables, development of improved models will provide important information about the physics of the behavior of interaction structures, in the large scale, low density extremes of symbiotic stars.|Y
ZAFPS|A Study of the Orbital Variability of Z Cam|Paula|Szkody|Washington|Z Cam is the prototype of the dwarf novae which exhibit standstills. Except for about 2 weeks, it has, been at continuous standstill for the last 4 years. Two previous standstill spectra have shown a large variability in line spectra. This variability will be investigated throughout the 7-hr. orbital cycle as well as continuum variability that could be associated with the hump that is present in the optical light curve (presumably the hot spot).  Z Cam is ideally suited for this type of study, since it has a relatively short orbital period (one IUE shift), is bright in the UV (1015 minute exposures) allowing good time resolution, has an orbital inclination on-the order of 60 degrees which is high enough to provide a hot spot variation that is evident in the optical (and therefore should be apparent in the UV if the spot is hot) and low enough to show a P Cyg line feature ( which can test models of the mass loss as a conical wind along the vertical direction) and has previous independent optical evidence for a circumsystem shell from H-alpha studies.|Y
ZAGNO|The Geometric Structure of Symbiotic Stars Eg Andromedae and Ax Persei|Nancy A.|Oliversen|CSC|Our objective is to refine the current models for the geometric structure and the extent of ionized and nebular material in symbiotic stars. We will focus on obtaining UV spectra at critical phases for the symbiotic stars EG Andromedae and AX Persei, which are believed to be binary stars. Low dispersion SWP and LWR spectra of AX Per are needed to complete the monitoring of a single orbital cycle which was begun in the sixth year of IUE. In addition, we propose to obtain a deep (roughly 6 hours) high dispersion SWP exposure of EG And at quadrature and one of AX Per during ingress. The high dispersion spectra of these stars will be used to study the interaction features such as streams, accretion disks and winds from either the cool and/or hot components. The mass ratio of the components of EG And will be estimated by comparison with two previous high dispersion images.|Y
ZAHNO|Nova-Like Outbursts in Z and Other Symbiotic Stars|Nancy A.|Oliversen|CSC|We propose a Target of Opportunity Program to observe selected symbiotic stars in outburst. The outburst mechanism in symbiotic stars is not well understood, due in part to the relative rarity of the event. The outbursts of AG Draconis (1980) and Z Andromedae (1984), which is the subject of a complementary 8th Episode IUE proposal, are the only symbiotic star outbursts to have been observed by IUE. Since the characteristics of the outburst can differ from star-to-star, additional observations during the initial active and post-outburst phases would be very helpful for modeling of the nova-like event. The stars have been selected to include hot stellar sources, main sequence accretors and possibly white dwarf hot components. The three types may result in distinctly different light curves. IUE observations of a novalike event will help to constrain models of the outburst mechanism (accretion versus thermonuclear event), to study the hot component (i.e. main sequence, subdwarf, or white dwarf) and to study the velocity structure in the outflowing wind.  Z Andromedae is considered to be the prototype of the symbiotic star. Most probably, it consists of a cool giant and a hot component, with one or both stars losing mass. The star is variable and once every 15 to 30 years undergoes a novalike outburst. In March, 1984 after a long period of quiescence it suddenly brightened to V=9.6. IUE observations of Z And were subsequently obtained during Spring to Fall, 1984. The ultraviolet line and continuum flux was significantly brighter compared to quiescent archival spectra. Since previous outbursts suggest that the activity may continue for several years we propose to continue this study. The outburst mechanism in symbiotic stars is not well understood. Observations of a symbiotic star during the active and post-outburst phases' would be very helpful for modeling the nova-like event. In particular, IUE observations of a nova-like event will help to constrain models of the hot component (i.e. main sequence, subdwarf, or white dwarf), to study the velocity structure in the wind and the geometric structure of the system as a whole.|Y
ZAHSK|Time Variability in Symbiotic Stars|Scott J.|Kenyon|Harvard CFA - SAO|We wish to obtain archival SWP and LWR spectra for a small sample of symbiotic stars. These data will be combined with contemporaneous optical and infrared spectroscopy to derive complete flux distributions for these objects as a function of time. Theoretical models have been constructed to predict the flux distribution emitted by a hypothetical symbiotic binary, which will be compared with the observations to derive: (i) the physical nature of the hot component and (ii) the physical conditions in the ionized nebulae as a function of time. The results of this study should yield quantitative estimates for the fluctuations in the mass transfer rate among these systems, and lead to a greater understanding of accretion processes within interacting binaries.|Y
ZAIMP|IUE and Voyager Coordinated Observations of Symbiotic Stars|Mirek|Plavec|University of California|We propose to obtain near-simultaneous observations of several symbiotic stars, notably AG Pegasi, RW Hydrae, and AG Draconis, with the IUE and Voyager. Combination of these observations will provide continuous spectral coverage from 900 A to 3200 A. Only with inclusion of the Voyager spectral region can we significantly narrow the range of possible models for the hot star or disk, the dense nebular component, and any wind component in these systems. The variable nature of these symbiotic stars requires new contemporaneous IUE region observations in order to fully utilize the significance of the Voyager data. Our large sample of ground-based spectrophotometric scans ( 3300-8000A) which have been regularly obtained since 1978 will be combined with reasonably contemporaneous archived IUE images to yield a comprehensive picture of the recent history of density and temperature diagnostics in these systems. Three carefully scheduled shifts (1 US1; 2 x 0.5 US2) can obtain the requisite IUE spectra.|Y
ZAINO|Nova-Like Outburst of Z Andromedae and Other Symbolic Stars|Nancy|Oliverson|CSC|Typically once every 15 to 30 years a symbiotic star will undergo a nova-like outburst. The outburst mechanism in symbiotic stars is not well understood, due in part to the relative rarity of such events. Until recently, the 1980 outburst of AG Draconis was the only one for which ultraviolet data were available for symbiotic stars. Within the last 1.5 years two symbiotic stars have become active; Z Andromedae and AG Draconis. IUE and optical data of the 1984 and 1985 outbursts were obtained during eighth episode IUE programs. Since previous outbursts suggest that the activity of AG Dra and Z And may continue for several years, we propose to continue this study.  The outburst mechanism may be different in AG Dra and Z And. The outburst of AG Dra may be due to a small-scale thermonuclear runaway on the surface of a white dwarf while the outburst of Z And may be due to accretion onto the hot main sequence star. IUE observations of these two stars during the active and post-outburst phases are essential for modeling the nova-like events and can be used to compare the characteristics of the two types of outburst mechanisms. IUE and optical observations of the nova-like events will help to contrain models of the hot component (i.e. main sequence, subdwarf or white dwarf) and to study the velocity structure in the wind. IUE observations of a symbiotic novae, such as V1016 Cyg or AG Peg, would be of particular interest.  We propose to obtain a deep high dispersion SWP and LWP spectra of Z And during this active phase. A joint US1/VILSPA shift is requested for this purpose. These spectra are crucial to the study of the velocity structure in the wind during the outburst. The longer exposure times are needed to detect the nebular density and temperature diagnostic lines such as O III, O IV and N III.|Y
ZAKMK|The C IV Doublet Intensity Ratio in the Peculiar Star RX Puppis|Minas C.|Kafatos|George Mason University|The C IV 1548,1550 emission doublet in the peculiar variable RX Puppis exhibits properties which uniquely characterize this system in the far ultraviolet. Its strong and rich UV emission line spectrum, which includes Si IV, O IV], N IV], He II, O III], Si III] and C III], as well as C IV, has enabled us to examine the line profile structure of strong resonance and intersystem lines in the SWP 1200-2000 wavelength range. HIRES spectra of RX Pup obtained since 1980 indicate the emission lines brightened significantly during 1982 to 1983, but since that time the object has been gradually declining in absolute intensity. Particularly noteworthy, the C IV doublet intensity ratio I(l548)/I(l550) was found to have values which are significantly less than the optically-thick limit of unity, especially during phases of enhanced emission. Our HIRES-SWP observations have shown that the C IV doublet intensity ratio is correlated with the combined intensity of the emission doublet C IV I(1548+1550), in the sense that the ratio becomes larger (but never significantly exceeds unity) as the doublet line flux decreases. The C IV doublet ratio is also inversley correlated with the visual light of the star, for which mV decreased by ~2 mags. since 1982, during which time the UV line intensities declined. A select few of other symbiotics have recently been found to exhibit a C IV doublet ratio less than unity. Curiously, the anomalous doublet intensity ratio is seen only in symbiotic stars. It could reflect a high velocity wind, in which blueshifted absorption diminishes  1548 emission relative to 1550. Alternatively, it could be due to the formation of circumstellar dust during slow-outbursts in these systems. IUE observations are requested to further investigate the temporal nature of the doublet ratio anomally, which may be cyclic on timescales of ~8 years.|Y
ZAKSK|The Bipolar Flow in CH Cygni|Scott|Kenyon|Harvard CFA - SAO|CH Cyg represents an important opportunity to test bowshock models for bipolar flows in symbiotic binaries. We propose to obtain low resolution spectra to resolve the bipolar flow spatially, and high resolution spectra to study nebular line profiles. Analysis of these data will allow us to determine the physical conditions and geometry of the flow, which will have implications for eruptive activity in other interacting binary systems.|Y
ZAMJE|Zeta-Aurigae Binaries with M Giants: Delta Sagittae ET AL II|Joel A.|Eaton|Tennessee State|Binary systems containing a hot star and a cool giant (zeta-Aurigae binaries) give us a way of studying cool giants' chromospheres independent of very complicated chromospheric models. Since such models are least certain for the cooler giants, observations of zeta Aur binaries containing M giants will be most valuable. We propose to continue observing the atmospheric eclipse of one of these, delta Sge, which will undergo an atmospheric eclipse centered at June 7, 1990. Observations being collected in the current year will cover the ingress phases, but with a gap in the phase range 0.950.98. The proposed observations in late summer and fall 1990 will cover this gap (at egress), allowing us to assess (1) asymmetries and temporal changes in the chromosphere and wind of the star and (2) the vertical structure of the chromosphere. Observations will be made of a group of long-period binaries containing M giants to look for changes in the UV spectrum that indicate an eclipse or change in an accretion disk.|Y
ZAMMK|Observations of Symbiotic Stars|Minas C.|Kafatos|George Mason University|We propose ultraviolet observations of two symbiotic stars CH Cygni and R Aquarii, both of which are associated with spatially extended emission, formed by high speed-bipolar mass ejection and collimated flow. These IUE spectra will be scheduled as close in time as is feasible with the ROSAT/High Resolution Imager (HRI) for observations in the 0.25 to 1 KeV energy range, during the pointed observing phase of the X-ray satellite. Coordinated UV/X-ray observations will enable us to determine if the emission measure of the highly ionized UV resonance lines of N V 1238,1240 and He II 1640 observed in these systems is consistent with photo-ionization by an intense flux of EUV/soft X-rays emitted at the inner edge of an accretion disk. The cone along which radiation escapes created by the thick accretion disk could explain why the N V and He II lines in R Aquarii are seen in the bright emission knots that comprise the radio/optical jet, and not in the central HII region, which presumably engulfs the accretion disk. Alternatively, in the high speed ~1000 km/s expanding bipolar radio lobes of CH Cygni, shock excitation may be the dominant means by which ejecta become ionized. Coordinated IUE and ROSAT observations will enable us to construct a model for explaining the ionization structure of spatially extended emission structures, that is based on the observed X-ray and UV emission, and the kinematics of the ejecta. These observations will provide clues concerning the physics of astrophysical jets in general. Our IUE observing program coordinated with the ROSAT/HRI, and procedure for data analysis are described.|Y
ZAMRR|Luminous Symbiotic-Like Variable in the LMC|Ronald A.|Remillard|MIT|Ultraviolet spectral observations with the International Ultraviolet Explorer are proposed for S-154, a luminous variable in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The star has been under study as an optical candidate for a HEAO-1 X-ray source. During the last few years, the object has changed from a low-excitation FeII star into a high-excitation state with emission lines very similar to those of symbiotic stars, suggesting a link between these spectral types. The UV spectra will provide new measures of the excitation level of the nebula and crucial evidence for assessing the nature of the embedded stellar component. The location in the LMC affords the ability to measure luminosities and the absolute magnitudes of spectral variations for this rapidly evolving object.|Y
ZAMRS|IUE-Rosat Observations of Symbiotic Binaries|Robert E.|Stencel|Colorado - CASA|We propose to use ultraviolet spectra obtained in close temporal proximity to ROSAT soft xray (and optical) observations of the 10 known x-ray symbiotic variable stars, in order to provide a full range of spectral diagnostic features for analysis of the interaction zones in these interacting binaries. Out group has been invited to collaborate with the ROSAT team in the analysis of all known symbiotics detected in the ROSAT all-sky survey data. The IUE data will provide art important complement to this effort.|Y
ZAMWF|High and Low Dispersion Observations of CN1-2|Walter A.|Feibelman|NASA/GSFC|The symbiotic system Cn1-2 was shown by Feibelman (1988) to exhibit a low dispersion ultraviolet spectrum in the 1200 - 3200 A range almost identical to that of V1016 Cygni and also very similar to HM Sagittae. No high dispersion IUE data exist for this interesting object which appears to be a southern counterpart to the extensively studied northern pair, The proposed IUE study should be particularly useful since the object showed considerable optical brightening in the 1940's but has been quiescent since then. Thus, another eruption is likely to occur in the not too distant future, which should make UV observations taken now of particular importance. The proposed study will result in determination of electron densities, temperatures, and possible wind parameters from a number of suitable doublets. Line profiles of the hot component are primarily accessible in the UV region.|Y
ZANMK|Observations of Symbiotic Stars|Minas C.|Kafatos|George Mason University|We propose ultraviolet observations of two symbiotic stars CH Cygni and R Aquarii, both of which are associated with spatially extended emission, formed by high speed-bipolar mass ejection and collimated flow. These IUE spectra will be scheduled as close in time as is feasible with the ROSAT/High Resolution Imager (HRI) for observations in the 0.25 to 1 KeV energy range, during the pointed observing phase of the X-ray satellite. Coordinated UV/X-ray observations will enable us to determine if the emission measure of the highly ionized UV resonance lines of N V 1238,1240 and He II  1640 observed in these systems is consistent with photo-ionization by an intense flux of EUV/soft X-rays emitted at the inner edge of an accretion disk. The cone along which radiation escapes created by the thick accretion disk could explain why the N V and He II lines in R Aquarii are seen in the bright emission knots that comprise the radio/optical jet, and not in the central HII region, which presumably engulfs the accretion disk. Alternatively, in the high speed ~1000 km/s expanding bipolar radio lobes of CH Cygni, shock excitation may be the dominant means by which ejecta become ionized. Coordinated IUE and ROSAT observations will enable us to construct a model for explaining the ionization structure of spatially extended emission structures, that is based on the observed X-ray and UV emission, and the kinematics of the ejecta. These observations will provide clues concerning the physics of astrophysical jets in general. Our IUE observing program coordinated with the ROSAT/HRI, and procedure for data analysis are described.|Y
ZAQAB|Eclipse Mapping of the Chromospheric and TR Structure of HR2554|Alexander|Brown|University of Colorado|We propose to observe the April 1994 eclipse of the zeta Aurigae-type binary HR2554. Every 195 days the Al dwarf secondary of HR2554 passes behind the outer atmosphere of the G6 II primary and can be used as a light source to observe absorption lines from plasma in the G star atmosphere.  The G star has a hybrid chromosphere structure with hot transition region plasma and a cool stellar wind. This same eclipse will also be observed by the GHRS on HST and these observations would be the first eclipse observations of this type of atmosphere with GHRS. IUE observations can perform an important role in coordinated IUE/HST observations of this star by providing much more complete coverage of UV eclipse variations and timing than possible with HST alone. The HST observations, while of higher signal-to-noise and resolution, will give only 8 snapshots of eclipse absorption line profiles during a very restricted time range compared to the complete eclipse.  We shall model the observed line profiles and determine the temperature structure, density stratification, wind acceleration/turbulence/ionization as a function of distance above the G star photosphere. The hot and cool plasma are intermixed in this outer atmosphere and we will quantify this "thermal bifurcation". Both the static and outflowing components of the atmosphere will be modelled. The mass loss rate and the wind velocity and density laws as a function of radius will be determined. The vast majority of the needed modelling code will have been developed already for our zeta Aur analysis. This project represents an opportunity to significantly advance knowledge about the spatial structuring of cool star outer atmospheres and the physical process operating within them. Our results for HR2554 will be compared with similar analyses, that we are presently conducting with GHRS/IUE data, for the K4 supergiant zeta Aur, which shows only the typical red supergiant wind.|Y
ZARCA|Initial Conditions on the Zero Age Main Sequence (ZAMS)|Carol W.|Ambruster|Villanova University|Combined EUVE and IUE observations of a small, homogeneous group of 6 solar-neighborhood Pleiades Moving Group members offer an unparalleled opportunity to determine the upper atmospheric structure of cool ZAMS stars for the first time, years and possible decades before TR or coronal spectroscopy of the nearest cluster ZAMS stars (in the Pleiades) is possible. Our group of 6 proxy Pleiads are essentially a controlled sample: they are all single, have the same age, mass, and temperature; the only variable is rotation rate. We request IUE observations during upcoming EUVE observations of HD 17925 and HD 82443, stars which follow a rotation-activity relation, and also HD 1405, a saturated star and our highest priority target. IUE spectra are essential for Volume Emission Measure (VEM) modelling, which we will use to address the following fundamental questions: a) upper atmospheric structure as a function of rotation at the point of hydrogen ignition, b) whether rotation alone governs activity, and c) the physical nature of saturation.|Y
ZBLJE|Zeta-Aurigae Binaries with M Giants:Delta Sagittae ET ALII|Joel|Eaton|Indiana University|Binary systems containing a hot star and a cool giant (zeta-Aurigae binaries) give us a way of studying cool giants' chromospheres independent of very complicated chromospheric models. Since such models are least certain for the cooler giants, observations of zeta Aur binaries containing M giants will be most valuable. We propose to observe the atmospheric eclipse of one of these, delta Sge, which will undergo an atmospheric eclipse centered at June 7, 1990, and to survey five other promising systems at one epoch each 1) to study the M giant's chromosphere and wind along one line of sight and 2) to determine what future observations of these stars will be most useful. These stars are especially promising since they are giants, as opposed to the supergiants usually found in zeta-Aur binaries, and because they contain relative faint hot secondary stars, which thus should have less effect on the chromosphere.|Y
ZZKGF|A Measurement of the Hydrogen-Layer Mass in the ZZ Ceti Star GD 66|Gilles|Fontaine|Universite de Montreal|The ZZ Ceti star GD 66 is a nonradial gravity-mode white dwarf pulsator showing a unique period structure characterized by periods that are multiple integers of a fundamental period interval. A recent application of asymptotic pulsation theory to ZZ Ceti stars indicates that this characteristic period spacing depends uniquely on the structural properties of the star and, in fact, is essentially sensitive to effective temperature, gravity, and hydrogen-layer mass. This raises the exciting possibility of actually measuring the amount of hydrogen left over on a typical white dwarf from previous evolution. To this end, it is proposed to derive the atmospheric parameters of GD 66 by classical model atmosphere& techniques, and use the characteristic period spacing of GD 66 to determine the hydrogen-layer mass in this DA star. The IUE satellite is to be used to acquire the SWP energy distribution of GD 66 and derive the effective temperature by comparing with (gravity-insensitive) theoretical energy distributions appropriate for this type of star. Using the IUE-based effective temperature, optical observations in the H-beta - H-epsilon wavelength range are to be obtained in conjunction with synthetic spectra in order to derive the gravity.|Y
ZZODK|Lower and Upper Boundaries of the ZZ Ceti Instability Strip|Detlev|Koester|Louisiana State University|The ZZ-Ceti stars are a subclass of white dwarfs with pure hydrogen envelopes (DA), which show nonradial g-mode oscillations. The instability strip extends between approximately 13000 K and 11000 K, with the exact location still uncertain. From comparison to theoretical pulsation studies we know that this location is strongly dependent on the formulation used for the mixing length theory of convection and on the structure of the outer layers of the white dwarf. The most efficient way to determine temperatures and surface gravity in this range is an analysis of the UV spectrum between 1200 and 1800 A. In this range the L-alpha line shows satellite features due to interactions with neutral and charged particles, which strongly depend on atmospheric parameters. The theory of these satellites has recently been improved by Allard and Koester (1992), and applied to the analysis of existing IUE spectra. We intend to use these theoretical predictions for an analysis of 5 objects that define the upper and lower boundaries of the instability strip.|Y
ZZOSK|Temperature of the ZZ Ceti Instability Strip|S. O.|Kepler|U Rio Grande do Sul|We propose to measure the short- wavelength ultraviolet energy distribution of one of the coolest ZZ Ceti (DAV) stars, to accurately derive its effective temperature. The scientific objective is to define the temperature of the instability strip for the ZZ Ceti stars, and to allow a pulsation model fit to the star, to interprete the Whole Earth Telescope observations obtained in May 1991.|Y
